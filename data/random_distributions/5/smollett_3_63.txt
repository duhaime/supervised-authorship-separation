The French coquet entraps the heart of the Jew,
against whom Pallet enters into a conspiracy; by
which Peregrine is again disappointed, and the
Hebrew's incontinence exposed. 
Mean while the French syren, baulked in
her design upon her English cully, who
was so easily disheartened, and hung his ears in
manifest despondence, rather than run the risque
of making a voyage that should be altogether unprofitable,
resolved to practise her charms upon
the Dutch merchant; and had already made such
innovation upon his heart, that he cultivated
her with peculiar complacency, gazed upon her
with a most libidinous stare, and unbended his
aspect into a grin that was truly Israelitish. The
painter saw, and was offended at this correspondence,
which he considered as an insult upon his
misfortune, as well as an evident preference of
his rival; and, conscious of his own timidity,
swallowed an extraordinary glass, that his invention
might be stimulated, and his resolution
raised to the contrivance and execution of some
scheme of revenge. The wine, however, failed
in the expected effect, and without inspiring him
with the plan, served only to quicken his desire
of vengeance; so that he communicated his purpose
to his friend Peregrine, and begged the assistance
of his imagination; but our young gentleman
was too intent upon his own affair, to
mind the concerns of any other person, and he
declining to be engaged in the project, Pallet had
recourse to the genius of Pickle's valet de chambre, 

who readily embarked in the undertaking,
and invented a plan, which was executed accordingly. 
The evening being pretty far advanced, and
the company separated into their respective apartments,
Pickle repaired, in all the impatience of
youth and desire, to the chamber of his charmer,
and finding the door unbolted, entered in a
transport of joy. By the light of the moon,
which shone through the window, he was conducted
to her bed, which he approached in the
utmost agitation, and perceiving her to all appearance
asleep, essayed to wake her with a
gentle kiss; but this method proved ineffectual,
because she was determined to save herself the
confusion of being an accomplice in his guilt. 
He repeated the application, murmured a most
passionate salutation in her ear, and took such
other gentle methods of signifying his presence,
as persuaded him that she was resolved to sleep,
in spite of all his endeavours: flushed with this
agreeable supposition, he locked the door, in
order to prevent interruption, and stealing himself
under the cloaths, set fortune at defiance,
while he held the fair creature circled in his
arms. 
Nevertheless, near as he seemed to be to the
happy accomplishment of his desire, his hope
was again frustrated by a fearful noise, which in
a moment waked his Amanda in a fright, and
for the present engaged all his attention: his
valet de chambre, whom Pallet had consulted as
a confederate, in his revenge against the lady of
pleasure and her Jewish gallant, had hired of certain
Behemians, who chanced to lodge at the
inn, a jack-ass adorned with bells, which, when 

every body was retired to rest, and the Hebrew
supposed to be bedded with his mistress, they led
up-stairs into a long thoroughfare, from which
the chambers were detached on each side; and
the painter, perceiving the lady's door a-jar, according
to his expectation, mounted this animal,
with intention to ride into the room, and disturb
the lovers in the midst of their mutual endearments; 
but the ass, true to his kind, finding
himself bestrid by an unknown rider, instead of
advancing, in obedience to his conductor, retreated
backwards to the other end of the passage,
in spite of all the efforts of the painter,
who spurred, and kicked, and pummelled to no
purpose. It was the noise of this contention between
Pallet and the ass, which invaded the ears
of Peregrine and his mistress, neither of whom
could form the least rational conjecture about the
cause of such strange disturbance, which increased
as the animals approached their apartment; 
till, at length, the Bourrique's retrograde
motion was obstructed by their door, which it
burst open, in a twinkling, with one kick, and
entered with such complication of sound, as terrified
the lady almost into a fit, and threw her
lover into an agony of perplexity and confusion. 
The painter, finding himself thus violently intruded
into the bed-chamber of he knew not
whom, and dreading the resentment of the possessor,
who might discharge a pistol at him, as a
robber who had broke into his apartment, was
overwhelmed with consternation, and redoubled
his exertion, to accomplish a speedy retreat,
sweating all the time with fear, and putting up
petitions to heaven for his safety; but his obstinate
companion, regardless of his situation, instead of 

submitting to his conduct, began to turn round
like a millstone, the united sound of his feet and
bells producing a most surprising concert. The
unfortunate rider, whirled about in this manner,
would have quitted his seat, and left the beast to
his own amusement, but the rotation was so rapid,
that the terror of a severe fall hindered him
from attempting to dismount, and in the desperation
of his heart, he seized one of its ears,
which he pinched so unmercifully, that the creature
set up his throat, and brayed aloud. This
hideous exclamation was no sooner heard by the
fair Fleming, already chilled with panic, and
prepared with superstition, than, believing herself
visited by the devil, who was permitted to
punish her for her infidelity to the marriage-bed,
she uttered a fearful scream, and began to repeat
her paternoster with a loud voice. Her lover,
finding himself under the necessity of retiring,
started up, and stung with the most violent pangs
of rage and disappointment, ran directly to the
spot from whence this diabolical noise seemed to
proceed, and encountering the ass, discharged
such a volley of blows at him and his rider, that
the creature carried him off at a round trot, and
they roared in unison all the way. Having thus
cleared the room of such disagreeable company,
he went back to his mistress, and assuring her,
that this was only some foolish prank of Pallet,
took his leave, with a promise of returning after
the quiet of the inn should be re-established. 
In the mean time the noise of the Bourrique,
the cries of the painter, and the lady's scream,
had alarmed the whole house; and the ass, in the
precipitation of his retreat, seeing people with
lights before him, took shelter in the apartment 

for which he was at first designed, just as the
Levite, arroused at the uproar, had quitted his
Dulcinea, and was attempting to recover his own
chamber, unperceived; but, seeing himself opposed
by such an animal, mounted by a tall,
meagre, lanthorn-jawed figure, half naked, with
a white night-cap upon his head, which added to
the natural paleness of his complexion, the Jew
was sorely troubled in mind, and believing it to
be an apparition of Balaam and his ass, fled backward
with a nimble pace, and crept under the
bed, where he lay concealed. Mr. Jolter, and
the priest, who were the foremost of those who
had been arroused by the noise, were not unmoved
when they saw such a spectacle rushing
into this chamber, from whence the lady of
pleasure began to shriek. The governor made a
full halt, and the Capuchin discovered no inclination
to proceed. They were (however) by
the pressure of the crowd that followed them,
thrust forward to the door, through which the
vision entered; and there Jolter, with great ceremony,
complimented his reverence with the
pas, beseeching him to walk in. The mendicant
was too courteous and humble to accept
this preheminence, and a very earnest dispute
ensued; during which the ass, in the course of
his circuit, shewed himself and rider, and in a
trice decided the contest; for, struck with this
second glimpse, both, at one instant, sprung
backward with such force, as overturned their
next men, who communicated the impulse to
those that stood behind them, and these again to
others; so that the whole passage was strewed
with a long file of people, that lay in a line, like
the sequel and dependance of a pack of cards. In 

the midst of this havock, our hero returned from
his own room, with an air of astonishment, asking
the cause of this uproar, and receiving such
hints of intelligence as Jolter's consternation
would permit him to give, snatched the candle
out of his hand, and advanced into the haunted
chamber without hesitation, being followed by
all present, who broke forth into a long and
loud peal of laughter, when they perceived the
ludicrous source of their disquiet. The painter
himself made an effort to join their mirth, but he
had been so harrowed by fear, and smarted so
much with the pain of the discipline he had received
from Pickle, that he could not, with all
his endeavour, vanquish the ruefulness of his
countenance; and his attempt served only to increase
the aukwardness of his situation, which
was not at all mended by the behaviour of the
coquette, who, furious with her disappointment,
slipped on a petticoat and bed-gown, and springing
upon him, like another Hecuba, with her
nails, deprived all one side of his nose of the skin,
and would not have left him an eye to see thro',
if some of the company had not rescued him
from her unmerciful talons. Provoked at this
outrage, as well as by her behaviour to him in
the Diligence, he publickly explained his intention
in entering her chamber in this equipage; 
and, missing the Hebrew among the spectators,
assured them, that he must have absconded
somewhere in the apartment: in consequence of
this intimation, the room was immediately
searched, and the mortified Levite pulled by the
heels from his lurking place; so that Pallet had
the good fortune, at last, to transfer the laugh 

from himself to his rival, and the French inamorata,
who accordingly underwent the ridicule
of the whole audience.
