Miss Cl. Harlowe, To John Harlowe, Esq; 

Thursday, Aug. 10. 
Honoured Sir,
It was an act of charity I begged: Only for a Last
Blessing, that I might die in peace. I ask not to
be received again, as my severe Sister [O! that I had
not written to her!] is pleased to say, is my view. 
Let that grace be denied me when I do. 
I could not look forward to my last Scene with
comfort, without seeking, at least, to obtain the
Blessing I petitioned for; and that with a contrition
so deep, that I deserved not, were it known, to be
turned over from the tender nature of a Mother, to
the upbraiding pen of an Uncle! and to be wounded
by a cruel question, put by him in a shocking manner; 
and which a little, a very little time, will
better answer than I can: For I am not either a
hardened or shameless creature: If I were, I should
not have been so solicitous to obtain the favour I sued
for. 
And permit me to say, that I asked it as well for
my Father and Mother's sake, as for my own; for I
am sure, They at least will be uneasy, after I am
gone, that they refused it to me. 
I should still be glad to have theirs, and yours, Sir,
and all your Blessings, and your Prayers: But denied
in such a manner, I will not presume again to ask it: 
Relying entirely on the Almighty's; which is never
denied, when supplicated for with such true penitence
as I hope mine is. 
God preserve my dear Uncle, and all my honoured
friends! prays 
Your unhappy
Clarissa Harlowe.
