Miss Clarissa Harlowe, To Miss Howe. 

Thursday Night, April 13. 
I always loved writing, and my unhappy situation
gives me now enough of it; and you I fear, too
much. I have had another very warm debate with
Mr. Lovelace. It brought on the subject which you
advised me not to decline, when it handsomely offered. 
And I want to have either your acquittal or blame for
having suffered it to go off without effect. 
The impatient wretch sent up to me several times,
while I was writing my last to you, to desire my company: 
Yet his business nothing particular; only to hear
him talk. The man seems pleased with his own volubility; 
and, whenever he has collected together abundance
of smooth things, he wants me to find an ear
for them! Yet he need not; for I don't often gratify
him either with giving him the praise for his verboseness,
or shewing the pleasure in it, that he would be
fond of. 
When I had finished the Letter, and given it to
Mr. Hickman's friend, I was going up again, and had
got up half a dozen stairs; when he besought me to
stop, and hear what he had to say. 
Nothing, as I said, to any new purpose had he to
offer; but complainings; and those in a manner, and
with an air, as I thought, that bordered upon insolence. 
He could not live, he told me, unless he had
more of my company, and of my indulgence too, than
I had yet given him. 

Hereupon I stept down, and into the parlour, not
a little out of humour with him; and the more, as
he has very quietly taken up his quarters here, without
talking of removing, as he had promised. 
We began instantly our angry conference. He
provoked me; and I repeated several of the plainest
things I had said in our former conversations; and
particularly told him, that I was every hour more and
more dissatisfied with myself, and with him: That he
was not a man, who, in my opinion, improved upon
acquaintance: And that I should not be easy till he had
left me to myself. 
He might be surprised at my warmth, perhaps; but
really the man looked so like a simpleton, hesitating,
and having nothing to say for himself, or that should
excuse the peremptoriness of his demand upon me
(when he knew I had been writing a Letter which a
gentleman waited for) that I flung from him, declaring,
that I would be mistress of my own time,
and of my own actions, and not be called to account
for either. 
He was very uneasy till he could again be admitted
into my company. And when I was obliged to see
him, which was sooner than I liked, never did man
put on a more humble and respectful demeanour. 
He told me, That he had, upon this occasion, been
entering into himself, and had found a great deal of
reason to blame himself for an impatiency and inconsideration,
which, altho' he meant nothing by it, must
be very disagreeable to one of my delicacy. That
having always aimed at a manly sincerity and openness
of heart, he had not till now discovered, that both
were very consistent with that true politeness, which
he feared he had too much disregarded, while he sought
to avoid the contrary extreme; knowing, that in me
he had to deal with a Lady, who despised an hypocrite,
and who was above all flattery. But from this time
forth, I should find such an alteration in his whole 

behaviour, as might be expected from a man who
knew himself to be honoured with the presence and
conversation of a person, who had the most delicate mind
in the world—that was his flourish. 
I said, That he might perhaps expect congratulation
upon the discovery he had just now made, to wit,
That true politeness and sincerity were reconcileable: 
But that I, who had, by a perverse fate, been thrown
into his company, had abundant reason to regret that
he had not sooner found this out: —Since, I believed,
very few men of Birth and Education were strangers
to it. 
He knew not, neither, he said, that he had so badly
behaved himself, as to deserve so very severe a rebuke. 
Perhaps not, I replied: But he might, if so, make
another discovery from what I had said; which might
be to my own disadvantage: Since, if he had so much
reason to be satisfied with himself, he would see what
an ungenerous person he spoke to, who, when he
seemed to give himself airs of humility, which, perhaps,
he thought beneath him to assume, had not the
civility to make him a compliment upon them; but
was ready to take him at his word. 
He had long, with infinite pleasure, the pretended
flattery-hater said, admired my superior talents, and a
wisdom in so young a Lady, perfectly surprising. 
Let me, Madam, said he, stand ever so low in your
opinion, I shall believe all you say to be just; and that
I have nothing to do, but to govern myself for the
future by your example, and by the standard you shall
be pleased to give me. 
I know better, Sir, replied I, than to value myself
upon your volubility of speech. As you pretend to pay
so preferable a regard to Sincerity, you should confine
yourself to the strict rules of truth, when you speak
of me, to myself: And then, altho' you shall be so
kind as to imagine you have reason to make me a
compliment, you will have much more to pride yourself 

in those arts which have made so extraordinary a
young creature so great a fool. 
Really, my dear, the man deserves not politer
treatment. —And then has he not made a fool, an
egregious fool, of me? —I am afraid he himself thinks
he has. 
I am surprised! I am amazed, Madam, returned he,
at so strange a turn upon me! —I am very unhappy, that
nothing I can do or say will give you a good opinion of
me! —Would to heaven that I knew what I can do to
obtain the honour of your confidence! 
I told him, that I desired his absence, of all things. 
I saw not, I said, that my friends thought it worth
their while to give me disturbance: Therefore, if he
would set out for London, or Berkshire, or whither
he pleased, it would be most agreeable to me, and most
reputable too. 
He would do so, he said, he intended to do so, the
moment I was in a place to my liking—in a place convenient
for me. 
This, Sir, will be so, said I, when you are not here
to break in upon me, and make the apartments inconvenient. 
He did not think this place safe, he replied; and as
I intended not to stay here, he had not been so solicitous,
as otherwise he should have been, to enjoin privacy
to his servants, nor to Mrs. Greme at her leaving
me; that there were two or three gentlemen in the
neighbourhood, he said, with whose servants his gossiping
fellows had scraped acquaintance: So that he could
not think of leaving me here unguarded and unattended. 
—But fix upon any place in England where I could be
out of danger, and he would go to the furthermost part
of the King's dominions, if by doing so he could make
me easy. 
I told him plainly that I should never be in humour
with myself for meeting him; nor with him, for seducing
me away: That my regrets encreased, instead of diminished: 

That my reputation was wounded: That nothing
I could do would now retrieve it: And that he must not
wonder, if I every hour grew more and more uneasy
both with myself and him: That upon the whole, I
was willing to take care of myself; and when he had
left me, I should best know what to resolve upon, and
whither to go. 
He wished, he said, he were at liberty, without
giving me offence, or being thought to intend to infringe
the articles I had stipulated and insisted upon, to make
one humble proposal to me. —But the sacred regard he
was determined to pay to all my injunctions (reluctantly
as I had on Monday last put it into his power to serve
me) would not permit him to make it, unless I would
promise to excuse him, if I did not approve of it. 
I asked, in some confusion, what he would say? 
He prefaced and paraded on; and then out came,
with great diffidence, and many apologies, and a bashfulness
which sat very aukwardly upon him, a proposal
of speedy Solemnization: Which, he said, would put all
right; and make my first three or four months (which
otherwise must be passed in obscurity and apprehension)
a round of visits and visitings to and from all his relations; 
To Miss Howe; To whom I pleased: And
would pave the way to the Reconciliation I had so much
at heart. 
Your advice had great weight with me just then, as
well as his reasons, and the consideration of my unhappy
situation: But what could I say? I wanted somebody to
speak for me. 
The man saw I was not angry at his motion. I only
blushed; and that I am sure I did up to the ears; and
looked silly, and like a fool. 
He wants not courage. Would he have had me catch
at his first, at his very first word? —I was silent too—And
do not the bold Sex take silence for a mark of favour? 
—Then, so lately in my Father's house! Having also
declared to him in my Letters, before I had your advice, 

that I would not think of marriage till he had passed
thro' a state of Probation, as I may call it—How was
it possible I could encourage, with very ready signs of
approbation, such an early proposal? especially so soon
after the free treatment he had provoked from me. If
I were to die, I could not. 
He looked at me with great confidence; as if (notwithstanding
his contradictory bashfulness) he would
look me through; while my eye but now-and-then could
glance at him. —He begged my pardon with great humility: 
He was afraid I would think he deserved no
other answer, but that of a contemptuous silence. True
Love was fearful of offending [Take care, Mr. Lovelace,
thought I, how yours is tried by that rule]. Indeed
so sacred a regard [foolish man!] would he have
to all my declarations made before I honoured him— 
I would hear him no further; but withdrew in a confusion
too visible, and left him to make his nonsensical
flourishes to himself. 
I will only add, that, if he really wishes for a speedy
Solemnization, he never could have had a luckier time
to press for my consent to it. But he let it go off; and
indignation has taken place of it: And now it shall be
a point with me, to get him at distance from me. 
I am, my dearest friend, 
Your ever faithful and obliged
Cl. H.
