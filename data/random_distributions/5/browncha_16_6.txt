The &longs;hock which this di&longs;a&longs;trous occurrence
occa&longs;ioned to my mother, was the foundation of a
di&longs;ea&longs;e which carried her, in a few months, to the
grave. My brother and my&longs;elf were children at
this time, and were now reduced to the condition
of orphans. The property which our parents left
was by no means incon&longs;iderable. It was entru&longs;ted
to faithful hands, till we &longs;hould arrive at a &longs;uitable
age. Meanwhile, our education was a&longs;&longs;igned to a
maiden aunt who re&longs;ided in the city, and who&longs;e
tenderne&longs;s made us in a &longs;hort time cea&longs;e to regret
that we had lo&longs;t a mother.
The years that &longs;ucceeded were tranquil and
happy. Our lives were mole&longs;ted by few of tho&longs;e
cares that are incident to childhood. By accident
more than de&longs;ign, the indulgence and yielding temper
of our aunt was mingled with re&longs;olution and
&longs;tedfa&longs;tne&longs;s. She &longs;eldom deviated into either extreme
of rigour or lenity. Our &longs;ocial plea&longs;ures
were &longs;ubject to no unrea&longs;onable re&longs;traints. We
were in&longs;tructed in mo&longs;t branches of u&longs;eful knowledge,
and were &longs;aved from the corruption and
tyranny of colleges and boarding-&longs;chools.
Our companions were chiefly &longs;elected from the
children of our neighbours. Between one of the&longs;e
and my brother, there quickly grew the mo&longs;t affectionate
intimacy. Her name was Catharine Pleyel.
She was rich, beautiful, and contrived to blend the
mo&longs;t bewitching &longs;oftne&longs;s with the mo&longs;t exuberant
vivacity. The tie by which my brother and &longs;he
were united, &longs;eemed to add force to the love which




I bore her, and which was amply returned. Between
her and my&longs;elf there was every circum&longs;tance
tending to produce and &longs;ofter friend&longs;hip. Our &longs;ex
and age were the &longs;ame. We lived within &longs;ight of
each other's abode. Our tempers were remarkably
congenial, and the &longs;uperintendants of our education
not only pre&longs;cribed to us the &longs;ame pur&longs;uits, but
allowed us to cultivate them together.
Every day added &longs;trength to the triple bonds
that united us. We gradually withdrew our&longs;elves
from the &longs;ociety of others, and found every moment
irk&longs;ome that was not devoted to each other. My
brother's advance in age made no change in our
&longs;ituation. It was determined that his profe&longs;&longs;ion
&longs;hould be agriculture. His fortune exempted him
from the nece&longs;&longs;ity of per&longs;onal labour. The ta&longs;k to
be performed by him was nothing more than superintendance.
The &longs;kill that was demanded by this
was merely theoretical, and was furni&longs;hed by ca&longs;ual
in&longs;pection, or by clo&longs;et &longs;tudy. The attention that
was paid to this &longs;ubject did not &longs;eclude him for
any long time from us, on whom time had no other
effect than to augment our impatience in the absence
of each other and of him. Our ta&longs;ks, our
walks, our mu&longs;ic, were &longs;eldom performed but in
each other's company.
It was ea&longs;y to &longs;ee that Catharine and my brother
were born for each other. The pa&longs;&longs;ion which
they mutually entertained quickly broke tho&longs;e
bounds which extreme youth had &longs;et to it; confessions
were made or extorted, and their union was
po&longs;tponed only till my brother had pa&longs;&longs;ed his minority.
The previous lap&longs;e of two years was constantly
and u&longs;efully employed.
O my brother! But the ta&longs;k I have &longs;et my&longs;elf
let me perform with &longs;teadine&longs;s. The felicity of




that period was marred by no gloomy anticipations.
The future, like the pre&longs;ent, was &longs;erene.
Time was &longs;uppo&longs;ed to have only new delights in
&longs;tore. I mean not to dwell on previous incidents
longer than is nece&longs;&longs;ary to illu&longs;trate or explain the
great events that have &longs;ince happened. The nuptial
day at length arrived. My brother took possession
of the hou&longs;e in which he was born, and
here the long protracted marriage was &longs;olemnized.
My father's property was equally divided between
us. A neat dwelling, &longs;ituated on the bank
of the river, three quarters of a mile from my brother's,
was now occupied by me. The&longs;e domains
were called, from the name of the fir&longs;t po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;or,
Mettingen. I can &longs;carcely account for my refusing
to take up my abode with him, unle&longs;s it were
from a di&longs;po&longs;ition to be an economi&longs;t of plea&longs;ure.
Self-denial, &longs;ea&longs;onably exerci&longs;ed, is one means of
enhancing our gratifications. I was, be&longs;ide, desirous
of admini&longs;tering a fund, and regulating an
hou&longs;ehold, of my own. The &longs;hort di&longs;tance allowed
us to exchange vi&longs;its as often as we plea&longs;ed. The
walk from one man&longs;ion to the other was no undelightful
prelude to our interviews. I was sometimes
their vi&longs;itant, and they, as frequently, were
my gue&longs;ts.
Our education had been modelled by no religious
&longs;tandard. We were left to the guidance of
our own under&longs;tanding, and the ca&longs;ual impre&longs;&longs;ions
which &longs;ociety might make upon us. My friend's
temper, as well as my own, exempted us from
much anxiety on this account. It mu&longs;t not be
&longs;uppo&longs;ed that we were without religion, but with
us it was the product of lively feelings, excited by
reflection on our own happine&longs;s, and by the grandeur
of external nature. We &longs;ought not a ba&longs;is




for our faith, in the weighing of proofs, and the
di&longs;&longs;ection of creeds. Our devotion was a mixed
and ca&longs;ual &longs;entiment, &longs;eldom verbally expre&longs;&longs;ed, or
&longs;olicitou&longs;ly &longs;ought, or carefully retained. In the
mid&longs;t of pre&longs;ent enjoyment, no thought was bestowed
on the future. As a con&longs;olation in calamity
religion is dear. But calamity was yet at a distance,
and its only tendency was to heighten
enjoyments which needed not this addition to
&longs;atisfy every craving.
My brother's &longs;ituation was &longs;omewhat different
His deportment was grave, con&longs;iderate, and thoughtful.
I will not &longs;ay whether he was indebted to
&longs;ublimer views for this di&longs;po&longs;ition. Human life,
in his opinion, was made up of changeable elements,
and the principles of duty were not ea&longs;ily unfolded.
The future, either as anterior, or &longs;ub&longs;equent to
death, was a &longs;cene that required &longs;ome preparation
and provi&longs;ion to be made for it. The&longs;e po&longs;itions
we could not deny, but what di&longs;tingui&longs;hed him
was a propen&longs;ity to ruminate on the&longs;e truths. The
images that vi&longs;ited us were blith&longs;ome and gay, but
tho&longs;e with which he was mo&longs;t familiar were of an
oppo&longs;ite hue. They did not generate affliction and
fear, but they di&longs;&longs;u&longs;ed over his behaviour a certain
air of forethought and &longs;obriety. The principal
effect of this temper was vi&longs;ible in his features and
tones. The&longs;e, in general, be&longs;poke a &longs;ort of thrilling
melancholy. I &longs;carcely ever knew him to
laugh. He never accompanied the lawle&longs;s mirth
of his companions with more than a &longs;mile, but his
conduct was the &longs;ame as ours.
He partook of our occupations and amu&longs;ements
with a zeal not le&longs;s than ours, but of a different
kind. The diver&longs;ity in our temper was never the
parent of di&longs;cord, and was &longs;carcely a topic of




regret. The &longs;cene was variegated, but not tarni&longs;hed
or di&longs;ordered by it. It hindered the element in
which we moved from &longs;tagnating. Some agitation
and concu&longs;&longs;ion is requi&longs;ite to the due exerci&longs;e of
human under&longs;tanding. In his &longs;tudies, he pur&longs;ued
an au&longs;terer and more arduous path. He was much
conver&longs;ant with the hi&longs;tory of religious opinions,
and took pains to a&longs;certain their validity. He
deerned it indi&longs;pen&longs;able to examine the ground of
his belief, to &longs;ettle the relation between motives and
actions, the criterion of merit, and the kinds and
properties of evidence.
There was an obvious re&longs;emblance between him
and my father, in their conceptions of the importance
of certain topics, and in the light in which the
vici&longs;&longs;itudes of human life were accu&longs;tomed to be
viewed. Their characters were &longs;imilar, but the
mind of the &longs;on was enriched by &longs;cience, and embellished
with literature.
The temple was no longer a&longs;&longs;igned to its ancient
u&longs;e. From an Italian adventurer, who erroneously
imagined that he could find employment for
his &longs;kill, and &longs;ale for his &longs;culptures in America,
my brother had purcha&longs;ed a bu&longs;t of Cicero. He
profe&longs;&longs;ed to have copied this piece from an antique
dug up with his own hands in the environs of Modena.
Of the truth of his a&longs;&longs;ertions we were not
qualified to judge; but the marble was pure and
poli&longs;hed, and we were contented to admire the performance,
without waiting for the &longs;anction of connoisseurs.
We hired the &longs;ame arti&longs;t to hew a &longs;uitable
pede&longs;tal from a neighbouring quarry. This was
placed in the temple, and the bu&longs;t re&longs;ted upon it.
Oppo&longs;ite to this was a harp&longs;ichord, &longs;heltered by a
temporary roof from the weather. This was the
place of re&longs;ort in the evenings of &longs;ummer. Here





we &longs;ung, and talked, and read, and occa&longs;ionally banqueted.
Every joyous and tender &longs;cene mo&longs;t dear
to my memory, is connected with this edifice. Here
the performances of our mu&longs;ical and poetical ancestor
were rehear&longs;ed. Here my brother's children received
the rudiments of their education; here a
thou&longs;and conver&longs;ations, pregnant with delight and
improvement, took place; and here the &longs;ocial affections
were accu&longs;tomed to expand, and the tear
of delicious &longs;ympathy to be &longs;hed.
My brother was an indefatigable &longs;tudent. The
authors whom he read were numerous, but the
chief object of his veneration was Cicero. He
was never tired of conning and rchear&longs;ing his productions.
To under&longs;tand them was not &longs;ufficient.
He was anxious to di&longs;cover the ge&longs;tures and cadences
with which they ought to be delivered. He
was very &longs;crupulous in &longs;electing a true &longs;cheme of
pronuciation for the Latin tongue, and in adapting
it to the words of his darling writer. His
favorite occupation con&longs;i&longs;ted in embelli&longs;hing his
rhetoric with all the proprieties of ge&longs;ticulation
and utterance.
Not contented with this, he was diligent in settling
and re&longs;toring the purity of the text. For this
end, he collected all the editions and commentaries
that could be procured, and employed months of
&longs;evere &longs;tudy in exploring and comparing them. He
never betrayed more &longs;atisfaction than when he
made a di&longs;covery of this kind.
It was not till the addition of Henry Pleyel, my
friend's only brother, to our &longs;ociety, that his pa&longs;&longs;ion
for Roman eloquence was countenanced and fostered
by a &longs;ympathy of ta&longs;tes. This young man
had been &longs;ome years in Europe. We had




separated at a very early age, and he was now returned
to &longs;pend the remainder of his days among us.
Our circle was greatly enlivened by the acce&longs;&longs;ion
of a new member. His conver&longs;ation abounded
with novelty. His gaiety was almo&longs;t boi&longs;terous,
but was capable of yielding to a grave deportment,
when the occa&longs;ion required it. His di&longs;cernment
was acute, but he was prone to view every object
merely as &longs;upplying materials for mirth. His conceptions
were ardent but ludicrous, and his memory,
aided, as he hone&longs;tly acknowledged, by his
invention, was an inexhau&longs;tible fund of entertainment.

His re&longs;idence was at the &longs;ame di&longs;tance below the
city as ours was above, but there &longs;eldom pa&longs;&longs;ed a
day without our being favoured with a vi&longs;it. My
brother and he were endowed with the &longs;ame attachment
to the Latin writers; and Pleyel was not behind
his friend in his knowledge of the hi&longs;tory and
metaphy&longs;ics of religion. Their creeds, however,
were in many re&longs;pects oppo&longs;ite. Where one discovered
only confirmations of his faith, the other
could find nothing but rea&longs;ons for doubt. Moral
nece&longs;&longs;ity, and calvini&longs;tic in&longs;piration, were the props
on which my brother thought proper to repo&longs;e.
Pleyel was the champion of intellectual liberty,
and rejected all guidance but that of his rea&longs;on.
Their di&longs;cu&longs;&longs;ions were frequent, but, being managed
with candour as well as with &longs;kill, they
were always li&longs;tened to by us with avidity and benefit.

Pleyel, like his new friends, was fond of mu&longs;ic
and poctry. Henceforth our concerts con&longs;i&longs;ted of
two violins, an harp&longs;ichord, and three voices.
We were frequently reminded how much




happiness depends upon &longs;ociety. This new friend,
though, before his arrival, we were &longs;en&longs;ible of no
vacuity, could not now be &longs;pared. His departure
would ocen&longs;ion a void which nothing could till,
and which would produce in&longs;upportable regrer,
Even my brother, though his opinions were hourly
a&longs;&longs;ailed, and even the divinity of Cicero conte&longs;ted,
was captivated with his friend, and laid a&longs;ide
&longs;ome part of his ancient gravity at Pleyel's approach.
