Mr. Belford, To Richard Mowbray, Esq; 

Thursday Afternoon. 
Dear Mowbray, 
I am glad to hear you are in town. Throw yourself
the moment this comes to your hand (if possible
with Tourville) in the way of the man who least of 

all men deserves the Love of the worthy heart; but
most That of Thine and Tourville: Else, the news I
shall most probably send him within an hour or two,
will make Annihilation the greatest blessing he has to
wish for. 
You will find him between Piccadilly and Kensington,
most probably on horseback, riding backwards
and forwards in a crazy way; or put up, perhaps, at
some Inn or Tavern in the way; a waiter possibly, if
so, watching for his servant's return to him from me. 
* * *
His man Will. is just come to me. He will carry
this to you in his way back, and be your director. 
Hie away in a coach, or any-how. Your being with
him may save either his or a servant's life. See the
blessed effects of triumphant libertinism! Sooner or
later it comes home to us, and all concludes in gall
and bitterness! Adieu. 
J. Belford.
