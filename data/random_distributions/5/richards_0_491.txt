To Miss Harlowe. 

Now may you, my dear Arabella, unrestrained by
the severity of your virtue, let fall a pitying tear
on the past faults and sufferings of your late unhappy sister; 
since, Now, she can never offend you more. The Divine
Mercy, which first inspired her with repentance (an early
repentance it was; since it preceded her sufferings) for an
error which she offers not to extenuate altho' perhaps
it were capable of some extenuation, has now, at the
instant that you are reading This, as I humbly hope, blessed
her with the fruits of it. 
Thus already, even while she writes, in imagination,
purified and exalted, she the more fearlesly writes to her
sister; and NOW is assured of pardon for all those little occasions 

of displeasure which her forwarder youth might
give you; and for the disgrace which her fall has fixed
upon you, and upon her family. 
May you, my sister, continue to bless those dear and
honoured relations, whose indulgence so well deserves your
utmost gratitude, with those chearful instances of duty and
obedience which have hitherto been so acceptable to Them,
and praise-worthy in You! And may you, when a suitable
proposal shall offer, fill up more worthily that chasm, which
the loss they have sustained in me has made in their family! 
Thus, my Arabella! my only Sister! and for many
happy years, my Friend! most fervently prays That Sister,
whose affection for you, no acts of unkindness, no misconstruction
of her conduct, could cancel! And who NOW,
made perfect (as she hopes) thro' sufferings, styles herself, 
The Happy
Clarissa Harlowe.
