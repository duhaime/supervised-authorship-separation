He is exposed to a most perilous incident, in the
course of his intrigue with the daughter. 
He was rejoiced to find her so easily satisfied
in such a momentous concern: for the
principal aim of the intrigue was to make her
necessary to his interested views, and even, if
possible, an associate in the fraudulent plans he
had projected upon her father; consequently
he considered this relaxation in her virtue, as
an happy omen of his future success. All the
obstacles to their mutual enjoyment being thus
removed, our adventurer was, by his mistress,
indulged with an assignation in her own chamber,
which, though contiguous to that of her
step-mother, was provided with a door that opened
into a common stair-case, to which he
had access at all hours of the night. 
He did not neglect the rendezvous, but, presenting
himself at the appointed time, which
was mid-night, made the signal they had agreed
upon, and was immediately admitted by Wilhelmina,
who waited for him with a lover's
impatience. Fathom was not deficient in those
expressions of rapture, that are current on such
occasions; but, on the contrary, became so
loud in the transports of self-congratulation,
that his voice reached the ears of the vigilant 

step-mother, who wakening the jeweller from
his first nap, gave him to understand, that some
person was certainly in close conversation
with his daughter; and exhorted him to rise
forthwith, and vindicate the honour of his family. 
The German, who was naturally of a phlegmatic
habit, and never went to bed without a
full dose of the creature, which added to his
constitutional drowsiness, gave no ear to his
wife's intimation, untill she had repeated it
thrice, and used other means to rouse him from
the arms of slumber. Mean while, Fathom
and his inamorata overheard her information,
and our hero would have made his retreat immediately,
through the port by which he entered,
had not his intention been over-ruled by
the remonstrances of the young lady, who observed
that the door was already fast bolted,
and could not possibly be opened without creating
a noise that would confirm the suspicion
of her parents; and that over and above this
objection, he would, in sallying from that door,
run the risque of being met by her father, who
in all probability would present himself before
it, in order to hinder our hero's escape: she
therefore conveyed him softly into her closet,
where she assured him he might remain with
great tranquillity, in full confidence that she
would take such measures, as would effectually
screen him from detection. 
He was fain to depend upon her assurance,
and accordingly insconced himself behind her
dressing table; but he could not help sweating
with apprehension, and praying fervently to
God for his deliverance, when he heard the 

jeweller thundering at the door, and calling to
his daughter for admittance. Wilhelmina,
who was already undressed, and had purposely
extinguished the light, pretended to be suddenly
waked from her sleep, and starting up, exclaimed
in a tone of surprize and affright,
“Jesu, Maria! what is the matter?” Hussey!
replied the German in a terrible accent, open
the door this instant, there is a man in your
bed chamber; and by the lightning and thunder! 
I will wash away the stain he has cast upon
my honour with the schellum's heart's-blood. 
Not at all intimidated by this boisterous threat,
she admitted him without hesitation, and with
a shrillness of voice peculiar to herself, began to
hold forth upon her own innocence and his
unjust suspicion, mingling, in her harangue,
sundry oblique hints against her mother-in-law,
importing that some people were so vitiously
inclined by their own natures, that she did not
wonder at their doubting the virtue of other
people; but that these people despised the insinuations
of such people, who ought to be more
circumspect in their own conduct, lest they
themselves should suffer reprisals from those
people whom they had so maliciously slandered. 
Having uttered these flowers of rhetoric,
which were calculated for the hearing of her
step-dame, who stood with a light at her husband's
back, the young lady assumed an ironical
air, and admonished her father to search
every corner of her apartment; she even affected
to assist his enquiry; with her own
hands pulled out a parcel of small drawers, in
which her trinkets were contained; desired 

him to look into her needle case and thimble,
and seeing his examination fruitless, earnestly
intreated him to rummage her closet also, saying
with a sneer, that in all probability, the
dishonourer would be found in that lurking-place. 
The manner in which she pretended to
ridicule his apprehensions, made an impression
upon the jeweler, who was very well disposed
to retreat into his own nest, when his wife, with
a certain slyness in her countenance, besought
him to comply with his daughter's request, and
look into that same closet; by which means
Wilhelmina's virtue would obtain a complete
triumph. 
Our adventurer, who overheard the conversation,
was immediately seized with a palsy of
fear: He trembled at every joint, the sweat
trickled down his forehead, his teeth began to
chatter, his hair to stand on end, and he, in his
heart, bitterly cursed the daughter's petulance,
the mother's malice, together with his own
precipitation, by which he was involved in an
adventure so pregnant with danger and disgrace. 
Indeed, the reader may easily conceive his disorder,
when he heard the key turning in the
lock, and the German swearing that he would
make him food for the beasts of the field, and
the fowls of the air. 
Fathom had come unprepared with weapons
of defence, was naturally an œconomist of his
person, and saw himself on the brink of forfeiting
not only the promised harvest of his double
intrigue, but also the reputation of a man of
honour, upon which all his future hopes depended:
his agony was therefore unspeakable,
when the door flew open, and it was not till after 

a considerable pause of recollection, that he
perceived the candle extinguished by the motion
of the air produced from the German's
sudden irruption. This accident, which disconcerted
him so much as to put a full stop to
his charge, was very favourable to our hero,
who summoning all his presence of mind, crept
up into the chimney, while the jeweller stood
at the door, waiting for his wife's return with
another light; so that when the closet was
examined, there was nothing found to justify
the report which the step-mother had made; 
and the father, after having made a slight apology
to Wilhelmina for his intrusion, retired
with his yoke-fellow into their own chamber. 
The young lady, who little thought that her
Papa would have taken her at her word, was
overwhelmed with confusion and dismay, when
she saw him enter the closet, and had her lover
been discovered, would in all probability have
been the loudest in his reproach, and perhaps
have accused him of an intention to rob the
house: but she was altogether astonished when
she found he had made shift to elude the inquiry
of her parents, because she could not
conceive the possibility of his escaping by the
window, which was in the third story, at a
prodigious distance from the ground; and how
he could conceal himself in the apartment, was
a mystery which she could by no means unfold. 
Before her father and mother retired, she lighted
her lamp, on pretence of being afraid to
be in the dark, after the perturbation of spirits
she had undergone, and her room was no
sooner evacuated of such troublesome visitants, 

than she secured the doors, and went in quest
of her lover. 
Accordingly, every corner of the closet underwent
a new search, and she called upon his
name with a soft voice, which she thought no
other person would overhear: but Ferdinand
did not think proper to gratify her impatience,
because he could not judge of the predicament
in which he stood by the evidence of all his
senses, and would not relinquish his post, until
he should be better certified that the coast
was clear. Mean while, his Dulcinea, having
performed her inquiry to no purpose, imagined
there was something preternatural in the
circumstance of his vanishing so unaccountably,
and began to cross herself with great devotion. 
She returned to her chamber, fixed the
lamp in the fire-place, and throwing herself
upon the bed, gave way to the suggestions of
her superstition, which were reinforced by the
silence that prevailed, and the gloomy glimmering
of the light. She reflected upon the
trespass she had already committed in her
heart, and in the conjectures of her fear, believed
that her lover was no other than the devil
himself, who had assumed the appearance
of Fathom, in order to tempt and seduce
her virtue. 
While her imagination teemed with those
horrible ideas, our adventurer concluding
from the general stillness, that the jeweller
and his wife were at last happily asleep, ventured
to come forth from his hiding-place,
and stood before his mistress, all begrimed
with soot. Wilhelmina lifting up her eyes,
and seeing this sable apparition, which she mistook 

for Satan in propria persona, instantly
screamed, and began to repeat her Pater-noster
with an audible voice: upon which Ferdinand; 
foreseeing that her parents would be
again alarmed, would not stay to undeceive
her, and explain himself; but unlocking the
door with great expedition, ran down stairs,
and luckily accomplished his escape. This
was undoubtedly the wisest measure he could
have taken: for he had not performed one
half of his descent toward the street, when the
German was at his daughter's bed-side, demanding
to know the cause of her exclamation:
she then gave him an account of what
she had seen, with all the exaggerations of her
own fancy, and after having weighed the circumstances
of her story, he interpreted the
apparition into a thief, who had found means
to open the door that communicated with the
stair, but having been scared by Wilhelmina's
shriek, had been obliged to retreat before he
could execute his purpose. 
Our hero's spirits were so woefully disturbed
by this adventure, that for a whole week he
felt no inclination to visit his inamorata, and
was not without apprehension that the affair
had terminated in an explanation very little
to his advantage. He was, however, delivered
from this disagreeable suspence, by an accidental
meeting with the jeweller himself, who
kindly chid him for his long absence, and entertained
him in the street, with an account of
the alarm which his family had sustained, by a
thief who broke into Wilhelmina's apartment. 
Glad to find his apprehension mistaken, he renewed
his correspondence with the family, and 

in a little time, found reason to console himself
for the jeopardy and panic he had undergone.
