He adjusts the method of his correspondence with
Gauntlet; meets by accident with an Italian
Charlatan, and a certain apothecary, who proves
to be a noted character. 
There the two friends adjusted the articles
of their future correspondence, and
Peregrine having written a letter to his mistress,
wherein he renewed his former vows of eternal
fidelity, it was intrusted to the care of her brother,
while Mr. Jolter, at the desire of his pupil,
provided an elegant supper, and some excellent
Burgundy, that they might spend this eve of his
departure with the greater enjoyment. 
Things being thus disposed, and a servant employed
in laying the cloth, their ears were of a 

sudden invaded by a strange tumultuous noise in
the next room, occasioned by the overthrow of
tables, chairs and glasses, with odd unintelligible
exclamations in broken French, and a jargon of
threats in the Welsh dialect. Our young gentlemen
ran immediately into the apartment from
whence this clamour seemed to proceed, and
found a thin meagre swarthy figure gasping in all
the agony of fear, under the hands of a squat,
thick, hard-featured man, who collared him with
great demonstrations of wrath, saying, “If you
was as mighty a magician as Owen Glendower,
or the witch of Entor, look you, ay, or as Paul
Beor himself, I will make pold, by the assistance
of Got, and in his Majesty's naam, to seize and
secure, and confine and confront you, until such
time as you suffer and endure and undergo the pains
and penalties of the law, for your diabolical practices. 
Shentlemens, added he, turning to our adventurers,
I take you to witness that I protest and
assert and avow that this person is as pig a necromancer
as you would desire to behold; and I supplicate
and beseech and intreat of you, that he may
be prought pefore his petters, and compelled to
give an account of his compact and commerce with
the imps of darkness, look you; for as I am a
christian soul, and hope for joyful resurrection,
I have this plessed evening seen him perform such
things as could not be done without the aid and
instruction and connivance of the Tevil.” 
Gauntlet seemed to enter into the sentiments
of this Welch reformer, and actually laid hold
on the delinquent's shoulder, crying, “Damn
the rascal! I'll lay any wager that he's a jesuit; 
for none of his order travel without a familiar.” 
But Peregrine, who looked upon the affair in
another point of view, interposed in behalf of 

the stranger, whom he freed from his aggressors,
observing that there was no occasion to use violence,
and asked in French what he had done to
incur the censure of the informer. The poor foreigner,
more dead than alive, answered that he
was an Italian charlatan, who had practised with
some reputation in Padua, until he had the misfortune
to attract the notice of the Inquisition, by
exhibiting certain wonderful performances by his
skill in natural knowledge, which that tribunal
considered as the effects of sorcery, and persecuted
him accordingly; so that he had been fain
to make a precipitate retreat into France, where
not finding his account in his talents, he was
now arrived in England, with a view of practising
his art in London; and that in consequence
of a specimen which he had given to a company
below, the choleric gentleman had followed him
up stairs to his own apartment, and assaulted him
in that inhospitable manner. He therefore earnestly
begged that our hero would take him under
his protection; and if he entertained the least
suspicion of his employing preternatural means in
the operations of his art, he would freely communicate
all the secrets in his possession. 
The youth dispelled his apprehension, by assuring
him that he was in no danger of suffering
for his art in England, where, if ever he
should be questioned by the zeal of superstitious
individuals, he had nothing to do but appeal to
the next justice of the peace, who would immediately
acquit him of the charge, and punish his
accusers for their impertinence and indiscretion. 
He then told Gauntlet and the Welshman, that
the stranger had a good action against them for
an assault, by virtue of an act of parliament,
which makes it criminal for any person to accuse 

another of sorcery and witchcraft, these idle notions
being now justly exploded by all sensible
men. Mr. Jolter, who had by this time joined
the company, could not help signifying his dissent
from this opinion of his pupil, which he endeavoured
to invalidate by the authority of scripture,
quotations from the fathers, and the confession of
many wretches who suffered death for having carried
on correspondence with evil spirits, together
with the evidence of Satan's Invisible World,
and Moreton's history of witchcraft. 
The soldier corroborated these testimonies by
facts that had happened within the sphere of his
own knowledge, and in particular mentioned the
case of an old woman of the parish in which he
was born, who used to transform herself into the
shapes of sundry animals, and was at last killed
by small-shot, in the character of an hare. The
Welchman thus supported, expressed his surprize
at hearing that the legislature had shewn such
tenderness for criminals of so dark a hue; and
offered to prove by undeniable instances, that
there was not a mountain in Wales, which had
not been in his memory the scene of necromancy
and witchcraft; “Wherefore, said he, I am assuredly
more than apove astonished and confounded
and concerned, that the parliament of
Great Pritain should in their great wisdoms and
their prudence, and their penetration, give countenance
and encouragement, look you, to the
works of darkness and the empire of Pelzepup; 
ofer and apove the evidence of holy writ, and
those writers who have been quoted by that aggurate
and learned shentleman, we are informed
by profane history, of the pribbles and pranks of
the old serpent, in the bortents and oragles of antiquity; 
as you will find in that most excellent 

historian Bolypius, and Titus Lifius; ay, and
moreofer, in the commentaries of Julius Cæsar
himself, who, as the ole 'orld knows, was a most
famous, and a most faliant, and a most wise, and
a most prudent, and a most fortunate cheiftan,
and a most renowned orator; ay, and a most
elegant writer to boot.” 
Peregrine did not think proper to enter the
lists of dispute with three such obstinate antagonists; 
but contented himself with saying, that he
believed it would be no difficult matter to impugn
the arguments they had advanced; though
he did not find himself at all disposed to undertake
the task, which must of course break in upon
the evening's entertainment. He therefore invited
the Italian to supper, and asked the same favour
of his accuser, who seemed to have something
curious and characteristic in his manner and disposition,
resolving to make himself an eye-witness
of those surprising feats, which had given
offence to the choleric Briton. This scrupulous
gentleman thanked our hero for his courtesy, but
declined communicating with the stranger, until
his character should be further explained; upon
which his inviter, after some conversation with the
charlatan, assured him that he would himself undertake
for the innocence of his art; and then he was
prevailed upon to favour them with his company. 
In the course of the conversation, Peregrine
learnt that the Welchman was a surgeon of
Canterbury, who had been called in to a consultation
at Dover, and understanding that his name
was Morgan, took the liberty of asking if he was
not the person so respectfully mentioned in the
Adventures of Roderick Random. Mr. Morgan
assumed a look of gravity and importance at this
interrogation, and screwing up his mouth, answered, 

“Mr. Rantum, my goot sir, I believe
upon my conscience and salfation, is my very
goot frient and wellwisher; and he and I have
been companions and messmates and fellow-sufferers,
look you; but nevertheless, for all that,
peradventure, he hath not pehaved with so much
complaisance and affability and respect, as I might
have expected from him; pecause he hath revealed
and tivulged and buplished our private affairs,
without my knowledge and privity and consent; 
but as Got is my safiour, I think he had
no evil intention in his pelly; and though there
be certain persons, look you, who, as I am told,
take upon them to laugh at his descriptions of my
person, deportment and conversation, I do affirm
and maintain, and insist with my heart, and
my plood and my soul, that those persons are no
petter than ignorant asses, and that they know
not how to discern and distinguish and define true
ridicule, or as Aristotle calls it, the &grt;&gro; &grg;&gre;&grl;&gro;&gric;&gro;&grn;, no
more, look you, than a herd of mountain goats; 
for I will make pold to observe, and I hope this
goot company will be of the same opinion, that
there is nothing said of me in that performance,
which is unworthy of a christian and a shentleman.” 
Our young gentleman and his friends acquiesced
in the justness of his observation, and Peregrine
particularly assured him, that from reading
the book, he had conceived the utmost regard
and veneration for his character; and that he
thought himself extremely fortunate in having
this opportunity of enjoying his conversation. 
Morgan, not a little proud of such advances from
a person of Peregrine's appearance, returned the
compliment with a profusion of civility, and in
the warmth of acknowledgement, expressed a
desire of seeing him and his company at his house 

in Canterbury: “I will not pretend, or presume,
kind sir, said he, to entertain you according to
your merits and deserts; but you shall be as welcome
to my poor cottage, and my wife and family,
as the Prince of Wales himself; and it
shall go hard, if one way or other, I do not find
ways and means of making you confess that there
is some goot fellowship in an ancient Priton: for
though I am no petter than a simple apothecary,
I have as goot plood circulating in my veins, as
any he in the county; and I can describe and
delineate and demonstrate my pedigree to the
satisfaction of the 'ole 'orld; and moreofer, by
Got's goot providence and assistance, I can afford
to treat my friend with a joint of goot mutton,
and a pottle of excellent wine, and no
tradesman can peard me with a bill.” He was
congratulated on his happy situation, and assured
that our youth would visit him on his return from
France, provided he should take Canterbury in
his route; and as Peregrine manifested an inclination
of being acquainted with the state of his affairs,
he very complaisantly satisfied his curiosity,
by giving him to know that his spouse had left off
breeding, after having blessed him with two boys
and a girl, who were still alive and well; that he
lived in good esteem with his neighbours, and by
his practice, which was considerably extended
immediately after the publication of Roderick
Random, had saved some thousand pounds, and
begun to think of retiring among his own relations
in Glamorganshire, where he had already
pitched upon a spot for his residence, though his
wife had made objections to this proposal, and
opposed the execution of it with such obstinacy,
that he had been at infinite pains in asserting his
own prerogative, by convincing her both from 

reason and example, that he was king and priest
in his own family, and that she owed the most
implicit submission to his will: he likewise informed
the company, that he had lately seen his
friend Roderick, who had come from London on
purpose to visit him, after having gained his lawsuit
with Mr. Topehall, who was obliged to pay
Narcissa's fortune; that Mr. Random, in all appearance,
led a very happy life in the conversation
of his father and bedfellow, by whom he
enjoyed a son and daughter; and that Morgan
had received in a present from him, a piece of
very fine linnen of his wife's own making, several
kits of salmon, and two casks of pickled pork,
the most delicate he had ever tasted; together
with a barrel of excellent herrings for salmagundy,
which he knew to be his favourite dish. 
This topick of conversation being discussed, the
Italian was desired to exhibit a specimen of his
art, and in a few minutes conducted the company
into the next room, where to their great astonishment
and affright, they beheld a thousand serpents
winding along the cieling. Morgan struck
with this phænomenon, which he had not seen
before, began to utter exorcisms with great devotion,
Mr. Jolter ran terrified out of the room,
Gauntlet drew his hanger, and Peregrine himself
was disconcerted. The operator perceiving their
confusion, desired them to retire, and calling
them back in an instant, there was not a viper to
be seen. He raised their admiration by sundry
other performances, and the Welchman's former
opinion and abhorrence of his character began
to recur, when in consideration of the civility
with which he had been treated, this Italian imparted
to them all the methods by which he had
acted such wonders, that were no other than the 

effects of natural causes curiously combined; so
that Morgan became a convert to his skill, asked
pardon for the suspicion he had entertained, and
invited the stranger to pass a few days with him
at Canterbury. The scruples of Godfrey and Jolter
were removed at the same time, and Peregrine
testified his satisfaction by an handsome gratuity
which he bestowed upon their entertainer. 
The evening being spent in this sociable manner,
every man retired to his respective chamber,
and next morning they breakfasted together, when
Morgan declared he would stay till he should see
our hero fairly embarked, that he might have the
pleasure of Mr. Gauntlet's company to his own
habitation; mean while, by the skipper's advice,
the servants were ordered to carry a store of wine
and provision on board in case of accident; and
as the packet-boat could not sail before one
o'clock, the company walked up hill to visit the
castle, where they saw the sword of Julius Cæsar
and Queen Elizabeth's pocket pistol, repeated
Shakespear's description, while they surveyed the
chalky cliffs on each side, and cast their eyes towards
the city of Calais, that was obscured by a
thick cloud which did not much regale their eyesight,
because it seemed to portend foul weather. 
Having viewed every thing remarkable in this
place, they returned to the pier, where after the
compliments of parting, and an affectionate embrace
between the two young gentlemen, Peregrine
and his governor stept on board, the sails
were hoisted, and they went to sea with a fair
wind, while Godfrey, Morgan and the conjurer
walked back to the inn, from whence they set
out for Canterbury before dinner.
