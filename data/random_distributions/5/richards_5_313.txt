Lady Grandison, To Lady G. 


Grandison-hall, Monday, April 9. 
How happy, my dear Lady G. are we all of us
here, in one another! How happy is your Harriet! 
â€”And yet when you can come, and partake of
my felicity, it will be still enlarged. 
I have just now received a Letter from Lucy. The
contents, as you will see (for I shall inclose it) are a
conversation that passed a few days ago at Shirley-manor,
upon a subject of which you are a better judge
than your Harriet. In short, it is a call upon you,
as I interpret it, to support your own doctrines; by
which, in former Letters, you have made some of
the honestest girls in England, half-ashamed to own
a first passion. You know how much I am at present
engaged. I would not have the dear girls neglected. 
Answer the Letter therefore for me, and for yourself; 
yet, remember, that I do not engage to abide implicitly
by your determination. Ever, ever, my Charlotte, 
Your most affectionate
Harriet Grandison.
