“Theodore wieland, the pri&longs;oner at
the bar, was now called upon for his defence. He
looked around him for &longs;ome time in &longs;ilence, and
with a mild countenance. At length he &longs;poke:
“It is &longs;trange; I am known to my judges and
my auditors. Who is there pre&longs;ent a &longs;tranger to
the character of Wieland? who knows him not as
an hu&longs;band—as a father—as a friend? yet here am
I arraigned as criminal. I am charged with diabolical
malice; I am accu&longs;ed of the murder of my
wife and my children!
“It is true, they were &longs;lain by me; they all perished
by my hand. The ta&longs;k of vindication is ignoble.
What is it that I am called to vindicate?
and before whom?
“You know that they are dead, and that they
were killed by me. What more would you have?
Would you extort from me a &longs;tatement of my motives?
Have you failed to di&longs;cover them already?
You charge me with malice; but your eyes are not
&longs;hut; your rea&longs;on is &longs;till vigorous; your memory
has not for&longs;aken you. You know whom it is that
you thus charge. The habits of his life are known
to you; his treatment of his wife and his offspring
is known to you; the &longs;oundne&longs;s of his integrity,
and the unchangeablene&longs;s of his principles, are familiar
to your apprehen&longs;ion; yet you per&longs;i&longs;t in this
charge! You lead me hither manacled as a felon;
you deem me worthy of a vile and tormenting
death!






“Who are they whom I have devoted to death?
My wife—the little ones, that drew their being
from me—that creature who, as &longs;he &longs;urpa&longs;&longs;ed them
in excellence, claimed a larger affection than tho&longs;e
whom natural affinities bound to my heart. Think
ye that malice could have urged me to this deed?
Hide your audacious fronts from the &longs;crutiny of
heaven. Take refuge in &longs;ome cavern unvi&longs;ited by
human eyes. Ye may deplore your wickedne&longs;s
or folly, but ye cannot expiate it.
“Think not that I &longs;peak for your &longs;akes. Hug
to your hearts this dete&longs;table infatuation. Deem
me &longs;till a murderer, and drag me to untimely death.
I make not an effort to di&longs;pel your illu&longs;ion: I utter
not a word to cure you of your &longs;anguinary folly:
but there are probably &longs;ome in this a&longs;&longs;embly who
have come from far: for their &longs;akes, who&longs;e di&longs;tance
has di&longs;abled them from knowing me, I will tell
what I have done, and why.
“It is needle&longs;s to &longs;ay that God is the object of
my &longs;upreme pa&longs;&longs;ion. I have cheri&longs;hed, in his presence,
a &longs;ingle and upright heart. I have thir&longs;ted
for the knowledge of his will. I have burnt with
ardour to approve my faith and my obedience.
“My days have been &longs;pent in &longs;earching for the
revelation of that will; but my days have been
mournful, becau&longs;e my &longs;earch failed. I &longs;olicited
direction: I turned on every &longs;ide where glimmerings
of light could be di&longs;covered. I have not been
wholly uninformed; but my knowledge has always
&longs;topped &longs;hort of certainty. Di&longs;&longs;atisfaction has insinuated
it&longs;elf into all my thoughts. My purpo&longs;es
have been pure; my wi&longs;hes indefatigable; but not
till lately were the&longs;e purpo&longs;es thoroughly accomplished,
and the&longs;e wi&longs;hes fully gratified.
“I thank thee, my father, for thy bounty; that




thou did&longs;t not a&longs;k a le&longs;s &longs;acrifice than this; that
thou placed&longs;t me in a condition to te&longs;tify my submission
to thy will! What have I withheld which
it was thy plea&longs;ure to exact? Now may I, with
dauntle&longs;s and erect eye, claim my reward, &longs;ince I
have given thee the trea&longs;ure of my &longs;oul.
“I was at my own hou&longs;e: it was late in the
evening: my &longs;i&longs;ter had gone to the city, but proposed
to return. It was in expectation of her return
that my wife and I delayed going to bed beyond
the u&longs;ual hour; the re&longs;t of the family, however,
were retired.
“My mind was contemplative and calm; not
wholly devoid of apprehen&longs;ion on account of my
&longs;i&longs;ter's &longs;afety. Recent events, not ea&longs;ily explained,
had &longs;ugge&longs;ted the exi&longs;tence of &longs;ome danger; but
this danger was without a di&longs;tinct form in our imagination,
and &longs;carcely ruffled our tranquillity.
“Time pa&longs;&longs;ed, and my &longs;i&longs;ter did not arrive; her
hou&longs;e is at &longs;ome di&longs;tance from mine, and though
her arrangements had been made with a view to
re&longs;iding with us, it was po&longs;&longs;ible that, through forgetfulness,
or the occurrence of unfore&longs;een emergencies,
&longs;he had returned to her own dwelling.
“Hence it was conceived proper that I &longs;hould
a&longs;certain the truth by going thither. I went. On
my way my mind was full of the&longs;e ideas which related
to my intellectual condition. In the torrent
of fervid conceptions, I lo&longs;t &longs;ight of my purpo&longs;e.
Some times I &longs;tood &longs;till; &longs;ome times I wandered
from my path, and experienced &longs;ome difficulty, on
recovering from my fit of mu&longs;ing, to regain it.
“The &longs;eries of my thoughts is ea&longs;ily traced. At
fir&longs;t every vein beat with raptures known only to
the man who&longs;e parental and conjugal love is




without limits, and the cup of who&longs;e de&longs;ires, immen&longs;e
as it is, overflows with gratification. I know not
why emotions that were perpetual vi&longs;itants &longs;hould
now have recurred with unu&longs;ual energy. The
tran&longs;ition was not new from &longs;en&longs;ations of joy to a
con&longs;ciou&longs;ne&longs;s of gratitude. The author of my being
was likewi&longs;e the di&longs;pen&longs;er of every gift with
which that being was embelli&longs;hed. The &longs;ervice to
which a benefactor like this was entitled, could not
be circum&longs;cribed. My &longs;ocial &longs;entiments were indebted
to their alliance with devotion for all their
value. All pa&longs;&longs;ions are ba&longs;e, all joys feeble, all
energies malignant, which are not drawn from this
&longs;ource.
“For a time, my contemplations &longs;oared above
earth and its inhabitants. I &longs;tretched forth my
hands; I li&longs;ted my eyes, and exclaimed, O! that I
might be admitted to thy pre&longs;ence; that mine were
the &longs;upreme delight of knowing thy will, and of
performing it! The bli&longs;sful privilege of direct
communication with thee, and of li&longs;tening to the
audible enunciation of thy plea&longs;ure!
“What ta&longs;k would I not undertake, what privation
would I not cheerfully endure, to te&longs;tify my
love of thee? Alas! thou hide&longs;t thy&longs;elf from my
view: glimp&longs;es only of thy excellence and beauty
are afforded me. Would that a momentary emanation
from thy glory would vi&longs;it me! that &longs;ome
unambiguous token of thy pre&longs;ence would &longs;alute
my &longs;en&longs;es!
“In this mood, I entered the hou&longs;e of my &longs;i&longs;ter.
It was vacant. Scarcely had I regained recollection
of the purpo&longs;e that brought me hither. Thoughts
of a different tendency had &longs;uch ab&longs;olute po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;ion
of my mind, that the relations of time and &longs;pace




were almo&longs;t obliterated from my under&longs;tanding.
The&longs;e wanderings, however, were re&longs;trained, and
I a&longs;cended to her chamber.
“I had no light, and might have known by external
ob&longs;ervation, that the hou&longs;e was without any
inhabitant. With this, however, I was not &longs;atisfied.
I entered the room, and the object of my &longs;earch not
appearing, I prepared to return.
“The darkne&longs;s required &longs;ome caution in descending
the &longs;tair. I &longs;tretched my hand to &longs;eize the
balu&longs;trade by which I might regulate my &longs;teps.
How &longs;hall I de&longs;cribe the lu&longs;tre, which, at that moment,
bur&longs;t upon my vi&longs;ion!
“I was dazzled. My organs were bereaved of
their activity. My eye-lids were half-clo&longs;ed, and
my hands withdrawn from the balu&longs;trade. A nameless
fear chilled my veins, and I &longs;tood motionle&longs;s.
This irradiation did not retire or le&longs;&longs;en. It &longs;eemed
as if &longs;ome powerful effulgence covered me like a
mantle.
“I opened my eyes and found all about me luminous
and glowing. It was the element of heaven
that flowed around. Nothing but a fiery &longs;tream
was at fir&longs;t vi&longs;ible; but, anon, a &longs;hrill voice from
behind called upon me to attend.
“I turned: It is forbidden to de&longs;cribe what I
&longs;aw: Words, indeed, would be wanting to the
ta&longs;k. The lineaments of that being, who&longs;e veil was
now lifted, and who&longs;e vi&longs;age beamed upon my
&longs;ight, no hues of pencil or of language can pourtray.

“As it &longs;poke, the accents thrilled to my heart.
“Thy prayers are heard. In proof of thy faith,
render me thy wife. This is the victim I chu&longs;e.
Call her hither, and here let her fall.”—The &longs;ound,
and vi&longs;age, and light vani&longs;hed at once.






“What demand was this? The blood of Catharine
was to be &longs;hed! My wife was to peri&longs;h by
my hand! I &longs;ought opportunity to atte&longs;t my virtue.
Little did I expect that a proof like this would have
been demanded.
“My wife! I exclaimed: O God! &longs;ub&longs;titute
&longs;ome other victim. Make me not the butcher of
my wife. My own blood is cheap. This will I
pour out before thee with a willing heart; but
&longs;pare, I be&longs;eech thee, this precious life, or commission
&longs;ome other than her hu&longs;band to perform the
bloody deed.
“In vain. The conditions were pre&longs;cribed; the
decree had gone forth, and nothing remained but to
execute it. I ru&longs;hed out of the hou&longs;e and acro&longs;s
the intermediate fields, and &longs;topped not till I entered
my own parlour.
“My wife had remained here during my absence,
in anxious expectation of my return with
&longs;ome tidings of her &longs;i&longs;ter. I had none to communicate.
For a time, I was breathle&longs;s with my &longs;peed:
This, and the tremors that &longs;hook my frame, and
the wildne&longs;s of my looks, alarmed her. She immediately
&longs;u&longs;pected &longs;ome di&longs;a&longs;ter to have happened
to her friend, and her own &longs;peech was as much
overpowered by emotion as mine.
“She was &longs;ilent, but her looks mani&longs;e&longs;ted her
impatience to hear what I had to communicate. I
&longs;poke, but with &longs;o much precipitation as &longs;carcely to
be under&longs;tood; catching her, at the &longs;ame time, by
the arm, and forcibly pulling her from her &longs;eat.
“Come along with me: fly: wa&longs;te not a moment:
time will be lo&longs;t, and the deed will be omitted.
Tarry not; que&longs;tion not; but fly with me!
“This deportment added afre&longs;h to her alarms.
Her eyes pur&longs;ued mine, and &longs;he &longs;aid, “What is the





matter? For God's &longs;ake what is the matter? Where
would you have me go?”
“My eyes were fixed upon her countenance
while &longs;he &longs;poke. I thought upon her virtues; I
viewed her as the mother of my babes; as my wife:
I recalled the purpo&longs;e for which I thus urged her
attendance. My heart faltered, and I &longs;aw that I
mu&longs;t rou&longs;e to this work all my faculties. The
danger of the lea&longs;t delay was imminent.
“I looked away from her, and again exerting
my force, drew her towards the door—`You mu&longs;t
go with me—indeed you mu&longs;t.'
“In her fright &longs;he half-re&longs;i&longs;ted my efforts, and
again exclaimed, `Good heaven! what is it you
mean? Where go? What has happened? Have
you found Clara?'
“Follow me, and you will &longs;ee,” I an&longs;wered, &longs;till
urging her reluctant &longs;teps forward.
“What phrenzy has &longs;eized you? Something
mu&longs;t needs have happened. Is &longs;he &longs;ick? Have you
foundh er?”
“Come and &longs;ee. Follow me, and know for
your&longs;elf.”
“Still &longs;he expo&longs;tulated and be&longs;ought me to explain
this my&longs;terious behaviour. I could not tru&longs;t
my&longs;elf to an&longs;wer her; to look at her; but gra&longs;ping
her arm, I drew her after me. She he&longs;itated, rather
through confu&longs;ion of mind than from unwillingness
to accompany me. This confu&longs;ion gradually
abated, and &longs;he moved forward, but with irre&longs;olute
foot&longs;teps, and continual exclamations of wonder
and terror. Her interrogations of “what was the
matter?” and “whither was I going?” were ceaseless
and vehement.
“It was the &longs;cope of my efforts not to think;
to keep up a conflict and uproar in my mind in




which all order and di&longs;tinctne&longs;s &longs;hould be lo&longs;t; to
e&longs;cape from the &longs;en&longs;ations produced by her voice.
I was, therefore, &longs;ilent. I &longs;trove to abridge this
interval by my ha&longs;te, and to wa&longs;te all my attention
in furious ge&longs;ticulations.
“In this &longs;tate of mind we reached my &longs;i&longs;ter's
door. She looked at the windows and &longs;aw that all
was de&longs;olate—“Why come we here? There is
no body here. I will not go in.”
“Still I was dumb; but opening the door, I drew
her into the entry. This was the allotted &longs;cene;
here &longs;he was to fall. I let to go her hand, and pre&longs;&longs;ing
my palms again&longs;t my forehead, made one mighty
effort to work up my &longs;oul to the deed.
“In vain; it would not be; my courage was
appalled; my arms nervele&longs;s: I muttered prayers
that my &longs;trength might be aided from above. They
availed nothing.
“Horror diffu&longs;ed it&longs;elf over me. This conviction
of my cowardice, my rebellion, fa&longs;tened
upon me, and I &longs;tood rigid and cold as marble.
From this &longs;tate I was &longs;omewhat relieved by my
wife's voice, who renewed her &longs;upplications to be
told why we came hither, and what was the fate of
my &longs;i&longs;ter.
“What could I an&longs;wer? My words were broken
and inarticulate. Her fears naturally acquired
force from the ob&longs;ervation of the&longs;e &longs;ymptoms; but
the&longs;e fears were mi&longs;placed. The only inference
&longs;he deduced from my conduct was, that &longs;ome terrible
mi&longs;hap had befallen Clara.
“She wrung her hands, and exclaimed in an
agony, “O tell me, where is &longs;he? What has become
of her? Is &longs;he &longs;ick? Dead? Is &longs;he in her
chamber? O let me go thither and know the
wor&longs;t!”






“This propo&longs;al &longs;et my thoughts once more in
motion. Perhaps what my rebellious heart refu&longs;ed
to perform here, I might obtain &longs;trength enough to
execute el&longs;ewhere.
“Come then,” &longs;aid I, “let us go.”
“I will, but not in the dark. We mu&longs;t fir&longs;t
procure a light.”
“Fly then and procure it; but I charge you, linger
not. I will await for your return.
“While &longs;he was gone, I &longs;trode along the entry.
The fellne&longs;s of a gloomy hurricane but &longs;aintly resembled
the di&longs;cord that reigned in my mind. To
omit this &longs;acrifice mu&longs;t not be; yet my &longs;inews had
refu&longs;ed to perform it. No alternative was offered.
To rebel again&longs;t the mandate was impo&longs;&longs;ible; but
obedience would render me the executioner of my
wife. My will was &longs;trong, but my limbs refu&longs;ed
their office.
“She returned with a light; I led the way to
the chamber; &longs;he looked round her; &longs;he lifted the
curtain of the bed; &longs;he &longs;aw nothing.
“At length, &longs;he fixed inquiring eyes upon me.
The light now enabled her to di&longs;cover in my vi&longs;age
what darkne&longs;s had hitherto concealed. Her cares
were now transferred from my &longs;i&longs;ter to my&longs;elf, and
&longs;he &longs;aid in a tremulous voice, “Wieland! you are
not well: What ails you? Can I do nothing for
you?”
“That accents and looks &longs;o winning &longs;hould
di&longs;arm me of my re&longs;olution, was to be expected.
My thoughts were thrown anew into anarchy. I
&longs;pread my hand before my eyes that I might not
&longs;ee her, and an&longs;wered only by groans. She took
my other hand between her's, and pre&longs;&longs;ing it to her
heart, &longs;poke with that voice which had ever &longs;wayed
my will, and wa&longs;ted away &longs;orrow.






“My friend! my &longs;oul's friend! tell me thy
cau&longs;e of grief. Do I not merit to partake with
thee in thy cares? Am I not thy wife?”
“This was too much. I broke from her embrace,
and retired to a corner of the room. In this
pau&longs;e, courage was once more infu&longs;ed into me. I
re&longs;olved to execute my duty. She followed me,
and renewed her pa&longs;&longs;ionate entreaties to know the
cau&longs;e of my di&longs;tre&longs;s.
“I rai&longs;ed my head and regarded her with &longs;tedfa&longs;t
looks. I muttered &longs;omething about death, and the
injunctions of my duty. At the&longs;e words &longs;he &longs;hrunk
back, and looked at me with a new expre&longs;&longs;ion of
angui&longs;h. After a pau&longs;e, &longs;he cla&longs;ped her hands, and
exclaimed—
“O Wieland! Wieland! God grant that I am
mi&longs;taken; but &longs;urely &longs;omething is wrong. I &longs;ee it:
it is too plain: thou art undone—lo&longs;t to me and to
thy&longs;elf.” At the &longs;ame time &longs;he gazed on my features
with inten&longs;e&longs;t anxiety, in hope that different
&longs;ymptoms would take place. I replied to her with
vehemence—
“Undone! No; my duty is known, and I thank
my God that my cowardice is now vanqui&longs;hed, and
I have power to fulfil it. Catharine! I pity the
weakne&longs;s of thy nature: I pity thee, but mu&longs;t not
&longs;pare. Thy life is claimed from my hands: thou
mu&longs;t die!”
“Fear was now, added to her grief. `What
mean you? Why talk you of death? Bethink
your&longs;elf, Wieland: bethink your&longs;elf, and this fit
will pa&longs;s. O why came I hither! Why did you
drag me hither?'
“I brought thee hither to fulfil a divine command.
I am appointed thy de&longs;troyer, and de&longs;troy
thee I mu&longs;t.” Saying this I &longs;eized her wri&longs;ts. She





&longs;hrieked aloud, and endeavoured to free her&longs;elf
from my gra&longs;p; but her efforts were vain.
“Surely, &longs;urely Wieland, thou do&longs;t not mean
it. Am I not thy wife? and would&longs;t thou kill me?
Thou wilt not; and yet—I &longs;ee—thou art Wieland
no longer! A fury re&longs;i&longs;tle&longs;s and horrible po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;es
thee—Spare me—&longs;pare—help—help—”
“Till her breath was &longs;topped &longs;he &longs;hrieked for
help—for mercy. When &longs;he could &longs;peak no longer,
her ge&longs;tures, her looks appealed to my compa&longs;&longs;ion.
My accur&longs;ed hand was irre&longs;olute and tremulous. I
meant thy death to be &longs;udden, thy &longs;truggles to be
brief. Alas! my heart was infirm; my re&longs;olves
mutable. Thrice I &longs;lackened my gra&longs;p, and life
kept its hold, though in the mid&longs;t of pangs. Her
eye-balls &longs;tarted from their &longs;ockets. Grimne&longs;s and
di&longs;tortion took place of all that u&longs;ed to bewitch me
into tran&longs;port, and &longs;ubdue me into reverence.
“I was commi&longs;&longs;ioned to kill thee, but not to
torment thee with the fore&longs;ight of thy death; not
to multiply thy fears, and prolong thy agonies.
Haggard, and pale, and lifele&longs;s, at length thou
cea&longs;ed&longs;t to contend with thy de&longs;tiny.
“This was a moment of triumph. Thus had
I &longs;ucce&longs;sfully &longs;ubdued the &longs;tubbornne&longs;s of human
pa&longs;&longs;ions: the victim which had been demanded was
given: the deed was done pa&longs;t recal.
“I lifted the corp&longs;e in my arms and laid it on
the bed. I gazed upon it with delight. Such was
the elation of my thoughts, that I even broke into
laughter. I clapped my hands and exclaimed, `It
is done! My &longs;acred duty is fulfilled! To that I
have &longs;acrificed, O my God! thy la&longs;t and be&longs;t gift,
my wife!'
“For a while I thus &longs;oared above frailty. I imagined
I had &longs;et my&longs;elf forever beyond the reach of




&longs;elfi&longs;hne&longs;s; but my imaginations were fal&longs;e. This
rapture quickly &longs;ub&longs;ided. I looked again at my
wife. My joyous ebullitions vani&longs;hed, and I asked
my&longs;elf who it was whom I &longs;aw? Methought
it could not be Catharine. It could not be the woman
who had lodged for years in my heart; who
had &longs;lept, nightly, in my bo&longs;om; who had borne
in her womb, who had fo&longs;tered at her brea&longs;t, the
beings who called me father; whom I had watched
with delight, and cheri&longs;hed with a fondne&longs;s ever new
and perpetually growing: it could not be the &longs;ame.
“Where was her bloom! The&longs;e deadly and
blood-&longs;uffu&longs;ed orbs but ill re&longs;emble the azure and
ex&longs;tatic tenderne&longs;s of her eyes. The lucid &longs;tream
that meandered over that bo&longs;om, the glow of love
that was wont to &longs;it upon that cheek, are much unlike
the&longs;e livid &longs;tains and this hideous deformity.
Alas! the&longs;e were the traces of agony; the gripe of
the a&longs;&longs;a&longs;&longs;in had been here!
“I will not dwell upon my lap&longs;e into de&longs;perate
and outrageous &longs;orrow. The breath of heaven that
&longs;u&longs;tained me was withdrawn, and I &longs;unk into mere
man. I leaped from the floor: I da&longs;hed my head
again&longs;t the wall: I uttered &longs;creams of horror: I
panted after torment and pain. Eternal fire, and
the bickerings of hell, compared with what I felt,
were mu&longs;ic and a bed of ro&longs;es.
“I thank my God that this degeneracy was transient,
that he deigned once more to rai&longs;e me alo&longs;t.
I thought upon what I had done as a &longs;acrifice to
duty, and was calm. My wife was dead; but I
reflected, that though this &longs;ource of human consolation
was clo&longs;ed, yet others were &longs;till open. If
the tran&longs;ports of an hu&longs;band were no more, the
feelings of a father had &longs;till &longs;cope for exerci&longs;e.
When remembrance of their mother &longs;hould excite




too keen a pang, I would look upon them, and
be comforted.
“While I revolved the&longs;e ideas, new warmth
flowed in upon my heart—I was wrong. The&longs;e
feelings were the growth of &longs;elfi&longs;hne&longs;s. Of this I
was not aware, and to di&longs;pel the mi&longs;t that ob&longs;cured
my perceptions, a new effulgence and a new mandate
were nece&longs;&longs;ary.
“From the&longs;e thoughts I was recalled by a ray
that was &longs;hot into the room. A voice &longs;pake like
that which I had before heard—`Thou ha&longs;t done
well; but all is not done—the &longs;acrifice is incomplete—
thy children mu&longs;t be offered—they mu&longs;t perish
with their mother!—'
