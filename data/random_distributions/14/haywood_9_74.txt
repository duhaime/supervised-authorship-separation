Is only a continuance of the same story. 
The ladies having finished their little regale, and the gentleman-usher of the ceremony withdrawn with his tea-kettle and lamp, Jenny began to testify some impatience for the knowledge of an event which as yet she could have no other room to guess at than by the exclamations of Sophia. 
“If I had not been infatuated, to a degree beyond whatever woman was, resumed that Lady, I must have seen that whatever Willmore pretended, his head was much more taken up with the thoughts of his commission than of his passion for me; for after the first retributions were over, he talk'd of little else during the whole time he staid. 
“He took his leave, however, in a manner tender enough, and I remained perfectly satisfied with his behaviour, as well as with myself for what I had done:—so high an idea had I both of his love and honour, that when, 
instead of seeing him again in five or six days, as he had made me expect, I heard nothing of him in three whole weeks, I was far from entertaining the least suspicion of him, nor felt any other alarms than what proceeded from my fears that some ill accident might have befallen him. 
“But at last he removed all my apprehensions on that score by sending me a letter, or rather billet, containing these lines: 

To miss Sophia ******.
“Madam,
I Have at last accomplished my affairs, which took me up more time and expence than I imagin'd;—all is now over, however, and there remains but one thing more to make me compleatly happy: —I shall be at Windsor in a few days, and will then give myself the pleasure of waiting on you, till when, believe me, 
“With great respect,
Madam,
Your most humble, and
Obedient servant,
G. Willmore.” 

“You look astonish'd, my dear miss Jessamy, pursued she, perceiving Jenny did so, and well, indeed, you may;—Did ever man write such a letter to a woman he courted,—who he knew loved him, and from whom he had received so great an obligation?—yet,—would you think it possible!—not even this open'd my blinded eyes;—I doubted not but by the one thing remaining to make him completely bless'd, he meant the consummation of our marriage; and the kindness of that expression sufficed with me to attone for all the cold indifference of the rest. 
“Eight days more, from the time of my receiving this epistle, were elapsed without my seeing or hearing any thing farther of him;—but when, at the expiration of that time, he came, whatever doubts might have been beginning to rise in my mind, they all vanish'd as soon as he appear'd, and were succeeded by a double portion of satisfaction. 
“I know not whether it was owing to his being so long absent from me, or whether the success of his affairs had diffused a more than ordinary sprightliness 
through all his air, but me-thought he look'd more charming, more engaging than ever;—the passion he pretended to have for me seemed also to be increased even to a romantic height; and after telling me that his own lawyer being out of town, and not chusing to employ any other, he had not brought the bond he promised;—‘But what occasion, cry'd he, eagerly kissing my hand, is there for the formality of a bond, when you have my heart,—my soul in your possession?—when myself and all I am, or ever shall be master of, is entirely at your command,—never happy till you accept the offer.’ 
“In fine, he continued to press me so closely on the article of marriage all that whole evening, that before we parted I made him a kind of half promise;—and to confess the truth, for I will hide nothing from you, I was at that time so much softened by the artifices he put in practice, that if I did not say positively,—I would be his,—it was owing rather to my bashfulness than want of inclination to comply. 
“Indeed when I came to reason with myself, I thought it would be a piece of silly nicety to keep him any longer in suspence;—that his family,—his person,—his accomplishments, and the post he had now obtain'd, might intitle him to a woman of a larger fortune than I was mistress of;—and that, putting love entirely out of the question, no body would condemn the choice I made of him. 
“In a word, my dear, having thus fix'd my resolution, the next visit assured him of my consent, and I told him that I was ready to give him my hand as soon as every thing necessary for that ceremony could be prepared. 
“I had often heard him, in casual conversation, express a great dislike of public weddings; and he now represented, that for ours to be so must infallibly be attended with many inconveniences;”‘—For besides, said he, the ridiculous bustle of drums,—trumpets,—epithilamiums, that always disturb the slumbers of people on their first going to bed together with a licence, there are so many young officers of my acquaintance, who would come the next morning 
to congratulate my happiness, as I know would he shocking to the modesty of my dear Sophia.’ 
“Finding I approved of what he said,”—‘For the reasons I have mentioned, resumed he, Windsor would be the most improper place in the World,—we both are so well known there, that the moment we are tack'd the bells would immediately proclaim what we had been about;—the thing can be done no where with so much privacy as in London;—and to tell you the truth, though perhaps you will laugh at my superstition, continued he, my father and mother were married at Ely chapel,—their whole lives was a series of love and joy,—and I should like, methinks, that my happiness should be fix'd at the same altar theirs was.’ 
“I could not, indeed, forbear rallying him a little on this whim, but replied, that I had not the least objection to the place he mentioned; but, on the contrary, should chuse that the ceremony should be performed there, rather than in any parish church whatever. 
“He then told me, that having flatter'd himself with finding me no less just to his passion than I now had been; he had already made some preparations which he hoped would not be displeasing to me: —I ask'd him of what nature,—to which he reply'd, that he had an aunt, an excellent good old lady, whom he had made the confidant of his courtship to me;—that by the character he had given her of me she approved highly of the match, and that we should be welcome to apartment in her house, 'till we could take one for ourselves, and get it fitted up for our reception. 
“To this he added, that she was a widow of a handsome jointure;—that her eldest son had a large estate in Somersetshire, and her youngest was a captain in the Navy;—that she had two daughters, who were both unmarried and lived with her;—that they kept the best of company;” —‘So that, my dear, continued he, you will find you do not marry into a family you will have any cause to be ashamed of.’ 
“He said a great deal more in praise of these relations, all which I took for gospel, and was so much charmed with the character of my aunt,—that was to be,—and two young cousins, that I almost longed to be with them; and it was presently concluded between us that I should go with him to London the next day;—that he should introduce me to these ladies;—that he should leave me with them for that night, and return in the morning with a ring and licence, in order to put the last hand to the business of his courtship. 
“Every thing being thus settled, as I then thought, much for my convenience and satisfaction, I slept that night without the least forebodings of the mischief that was just ready to fall upon me;—about eleven the next morning a chariot, by Willmore's order, came to the door;—I told my maids I was going on some business to London, but should come back in a few days, as I knew I was obliged to do, on account of delivering up the keys of the house, and all that was in it, to the person whom my brother had intrusted with the care of his affairs, so took nothing with me but some linnen and a wrapping gown;—I took up Willmore at 
the corner of a back lane, where he waited by appointment for me, and we drove directly to London. 
“We alighted at the door of a handsome house in one of the streets near Hatton-Garden, and were immediately shew'd up into the dining-room, where we found a grave old gentlewoman, whose appearance answered very well to the description Willmore had given of her;—he presented me to her with these words:” —‘This, madam, said he, is the lady I spoke of, and who has at last consented to make me happy.’ —“She received me with a great shew of respect and kindness, but accompany'd with a certain stiffness, which I thought had something of affectation in it; but this I imputed merely to the time in which she had been educated, according to the silly notion, that people of the last age were less free in their conversation than those of ours. 
“The room we were in was very genteely furnished; but what most attracted my eyes, were the pictures of five or six young ladies, very different in their features and complexions, but all of them extremely handsome;—I 
could not forbear expressing my admiration of these pieces to the old lady, who told me that two of them were drawn for her daughters, and the other for her nieces and cousins; and added, that she hoped one day to have the honour of seeing mine there;—I reply'd, that I should make but an ill figure among so many beauties, on which she made me many compliments not worth repeating. 
“Chocolate and biscuits were the first things presented to us, and were soon after succeeded by a bottle of Madeira;—the old lady said, that she was disconcerted beyond measure; that not being certain of my coming she was not provided in the manner she would have been for my reception; and particularly that she had given her daughters leave to go on a party of pleasure with some persons of quality; but added, that they would be at home in a day or two, and hoped her family would then be more agreeable to me: 
—I was of her opinion, indeed, as to this last article; but could not avoid telling her, that nothing could be wanting where she was:—this drew on so many compliments in return, that I should have been very much embarrass'd 
to reply, if Willmore, the only thing I have to thank him for, had not given a turn to the conversation. 
“Soon after lighting the candles supper was served in, which consisted of several small dishes, all in a foreign taste; when the cloth was taken away, and bottles and glasses set upon the table, the old lady began the king's health in a bumper,—then another to the prince of Wales, and a third to the duke of Cumberland;—these having gone round, Willmore ran to the sideboard, fetch'd a large water-glass, which filling to the brim,”—‘Here is the noble duke again, cried he, we cannot toast his health too often;—here is to his royal highness, and prosperity to the army,—may they increase and multiply till every housekeeper in London and Westminster has at least half a dozen of them quarter'd at once upon him.’ 
“I cannot say that I was pleased with anything which shew'd a tendency to the manifest destruction of the constitution and liberties of my country; but I thought myself about to be the wife of a soldier, and that it would not become me to make any objection:— 
“I only repeat these circumstances to you, to let you see what company I was among. 
“The night growing pretty far advanced, Willmore began to talk of going home, and desired a coach might be called; but his kind relation told him, she could not bear he should think of such a thing,—said, that as the girls were abroad he might lie in their bed without the least trouble to any one in the family,—reminded him that it was a long and very ugly way from Hatton-Garden to his lodgings at Whitehall, and bid him consider how many desperate fellows lay in wait for the purses, and even lives of gentlemen who expose themselves, as he would do, to their villainous attacks;—he seeming to laugh at all this, and insisting that a coach should be called, she renewed her remonstrances, and begg'd of me to second them; which I readily did, having heard such frightful stories of street-robberies, that I was in more real terror for him than she affected to be. 
“I no sooner spoke than he pull'd off his sword, and said my commands were not to be disputed, he would 
stay;”—‘But, madam, continued he, turning to the old lady, I am afraid we have kept you up beyond your hour.’ —‘I am never weary of good company, answer'd she; but for this sweet young lady's sake, who may want repose after her journey, I think it may be proper for us to retire;’—in speaking these words she rung her bell for a servant to shew Willmore to his chamber;—she would needs attend me herself into that allotted for me, and see me into bed; but whether she did this out of complaisance, or a far different motive, you will presently be judge.” 
Here the melancholy Sophia stopp'd to take breath; and as it is very possible the reader will be glad to do so too, I shall defer giving the catastrophe of this adventure till the next chapter. 
There is a maxim which I have always thought worthy of being observed by every writer, that an old author has delivered down to posterity in these lines: 
Too much of one thing the vex'd mind will cloy,
It asks a relaxation e'en from joy.
