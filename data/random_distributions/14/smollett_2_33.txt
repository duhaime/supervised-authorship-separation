DEAR PHILLIPS,
I SEND you this letter, franked by our old
friend Barton; who is as much altered as it was
possible for a man of his kidney to be—Instead of
the careless, indolent sloven we knew at Oxford,
I found him a busy talkative politician; a petre-maitre
in his dress, and a ceremonious courtier in
his manners. He has not gall enough in his constitution
to be inflamed with the rancour of party,
so as to deal in scurrilous invectives; but, since he
obtained a place, he is become a warm partizan of
the ministry, and sees every thing through such an
exaggerating medium, as to me, who are happily
of no party, is altogether incomprehensible— 
Without all doubt, the fumes of faction not only
disturb the faculty of reason, but also pervert the
organs of sense; and I would lay an hundred guineas
to ten, that if Barton on one side, and the
most consciencious patriot in the opposition on the
other, were to draw, upon honour, the picture of
the k&wblank; or m&wblank;, you and I, who are still uninfected,
and unbiased, would find both painters equally
distant from the truth. One thing, however,
must be allowed for the honour of Barton, he never
breaks out into illiberal abuse, far less endeavours,
by infamous calumnies, to blast the moral
character of any individual, on the other side. 

Ever since we came hither, he has been remarkably
assiduous in his attention to our family; an
attention, which in a man of his indolence and
avocations, I should have thought altogether odd,
and even unnatural, had not I perceived that my
sister Liddy has made some impression upon his
heart. I can't say that I have any objection to
his trying his fortune in this pursuit; if an opulent
estate, and a great stock of good-nature are
sufficient qualifications in a husband, to render the
marriage-state happy for life, she may be happy
with Barton: but, I imagine, there is something
else required to engage and secure the affection of
a woman of sense and delicacy: something which
nature has denied our friend—Liddy seems to be
of the same opinion. When he addresses himself
to her in discourse, she seems to listen with
reluctance, and industriously avoids all particular
communication; but in proportion to her coyness,
our aunt is coming. Mrs. Tabitha goes more
than half way to meet his advances; she mistakes,
or affects to mistake, the meaning of his courtesy,
which is rather formal and fulsome; she returns
his compliments with hyperbolical interest, she
persecutes him with her civilities at table, she appeals
to him for ever in conversation, she sighs, and flirts,
and ogles, and by her hideous affectation and impertinence,
drives the poor courtier to the very
extremity of his complaisance: in short, she seems
to have undertaken the siege of Barton's heart,
and carries on her approaches in such a desperate
manner, that I don't know whether he will not be
obliged to capitulate. In the mean time, his aversion
to this inamorata struggling with his acquired
affability, and his natural fear of giving offence,
throws him into a kind of distress which is extremely
ridiculous. 
Two days ago, he persuaded my uncle and me to
accompany him to St. James's, where he undertook 

took to make us acquainted with the persons of all
the great men in the kingdom; and, indeed, there
was a great assemblage of distinguished characters,
for it was a high festival at court. Our conductor
performed his promise with great punctuality. He
pointed out almost every individual of both sexes,
and generally introduced them to our notice, with
a flourish of panegyrick—Seeing the King approach,
“There comes (said he) the most amiable
sovereign that ever swayed the sceptre of England; 
the deliciæ humani generis; Augustus, in
patronizing merit; Titus Vespasian in generosity; 
Tragan in benificence; and Marcus Aurelius,
in philosophy.” “A very honest kind
hearted gentleman (added my uncle); he's too
good for the times. A king of England should
have a spice of the devil in his composition.” 
Barton, then turning to the duke of C&wblank;, proceeded,
—“You know the duke; that illustrious hero,
who trod rebellion under his feet, and secured us
in possession of every thing we ought to hold dear,
as Englishmen and Christians. Mark what an
eye, how penetrating, yet pacific! what dignity
in his mein! what humanity in his aspect— 
Even malice must own, that he is one of the
greatest officers in Christendom.” “I think he
be (said Mr. Bramble); but who are these young
gentlemen that stand beside him?” “Those!
(cried our friend) those are his royal nephews; 
the princes of the blood. Sweet young princes!
the sacred pledges of the Protestant line; so spirited
so sensible, so princely—” “Yes; very
sensible! very spirited! (said my uncle, interrupting
him) but see the queen! ha, there's the
queen—There's the queen! let me see—Let me
see—Where are my glasses? ha! there's meaning
in that eye—There's sentiment—There's
expression. Well, Mr. Barton, what figure do 

you call next?” The next person he pointed
out, was the favourite yearl; who stood solitary
by one of the windows—“Behold yon northern
star, (said he) shorn of his beams—” “What!
the Caledonian luminary, that lately blazed so
bright in our hemisphere! methinks, at present,
it glimmers through a fog; like Saturn without
his ring, bleak and dim, and distant—Ha, there's
the other great phenomenon, the grand pensionary,
that weather-cock of patriotism that veers
about in every point of the political compass,
and still feels the wind of popularity in his tail. 
He too, like a portentous comet, has risen above
the court horizon; but how long he will continue
to ascend, it is not easy to foretell, considering
his great eccentricity—Who are those
two satellites that attend his motions?” When
Barton told him their names, “To their characters
(said Mr. Bramble) I am no stranger. One
of them, without a drop of red blood in his veins,
has a cold, intoxicating vapour in his head; and,
rancour enough in his heart to inoculate and affect
a whole nation. The other is (I hear) intended
for a share in the ad&wblank;n, and the pensionary
vouches for his being duly qualified—The
only instance I ever heard of his sagacity, was
his deserting his former patron, when he found
him declining in power, and in disgrace with
the people. Without principle, talent, or intelligence,
he is as ungracious as a hog, greedy
as a vulture and thievish as a jackdaw; but, it
must be owned, he is no hypocrite. He pretends
to no virtue, and takes no pains to disguise his
character—His ministry will be attended with
one advantage, no man will be disappointed by
his breach of promise, as no mortal ever trusted
to his word. I wonder how lord&wblank; first
discovered this happy genius, and for what purpose 

lord—has now adopted him: but one
would think, that as amber has a power to attract
dirt, and straws, and chaff, a minister is
endued with the same kind of faculty, to lick
up every knave and blockhead in his way—” 
His eulogium was interrupted by the arrival of
the old duke of N&wblank;; who, squeezing into the
circle with a busy face of importance, trust his
head into every countenance, as if he had been
in search of some body, to whom he wanted to
impart something of great consequence—My
uncle, who had been formerly known to him,
bowed as he passed, and the duke, seeing himself
saluted so respectfully by a well-dressed person,
was not slow in returning the curtesy— 
He even came up, and, and taking him cordially by
the hand, “My dear friend, Mr. A&wblank;, (said
he) I am rejoiced to see you—How long have
you been come from abroad? —How did you
leave our good friends, the Dutch? The king
of Prussia don't think of another war, ah? — 
He's a great king! a great conqueror! a very
great conqueror! Your Alexanders and Hannibals
were nothing at all to him, Sir&wblank;Corporals!
drummers! dross! mere trash— 
Damned trash, heh?—”  His grace being by
this time out of breath, my uncle took the opportunity
to tell him he had not been out of
England, that his name was Bramble, and that
he had the honour to sit in the last parliament
but one of the late king, as representative for the
borough of Dymkymraig. “Odso! (cried the
duke) I remember you perfectly well, my dear
Mr. Bramble—You was always a good and
loyal subject—a staunch friend to administration
—I made your brother an Irish bishop— 
Pardon me, my lord, (said the 'squire) I, once
had a brother, but he was a captain in the 

army—” “Ha! said his grace) he was so—He
was, indeed! But who was the bishop then? 
Bishop Blackberry—Sure it was Bishop Blackberry
—Perhaps some relation of yours—” 
“Very likely, my lord (replied my uncle); the
Blackberry is the fruit of the Bramble—But, I
believe, the Bishop is not a berry of our bush—” 
“No more he is—No more he is, ha, ha, ha!— 
(exclaimed the duke) there you gave me a
scratch, good Mr. Bramble, ha, ha, ha!— 
Well, I shall be glad to see you at Lincoln's-inn-fields
—You know the way—Times are
altered. Though I have lost the power, I retain
the inclination—Your very humble servant,
good Mr. Blackberry—” So saying, he shoved
to another corner of the room. “What a fine
old gentleman! (cried Mr. Barton) what spirits!
what a memory! —He never forgets an old
friend.” “He does me too much honour,
(observed our 'squire) to rank me among the
number—Whilst I sat in parliament, I never
voted with the ministry but three times, when
my conscience told me they were in the right:
however, if he still keeps levee, I will carry
my nephew thither, that he may see, and learn
to avoid the scene; for, I think, an English
gentleman never appears to such disadvantage,
as at the levee of a minister—Of his grace I
shall say nothing at present, but that for thirty
years he was the constant and common but of
ridicule and execration. He was generally
laughed at as an ape in politics, whose office
and influence served only to render his folly the
more notorious; and the opposition cursed him,
as the indefatigable drudge of a first-mover,
who was justly stiled and stigmatized as the father
of corruption: but this ridiculous ape, 

this venal drudge, no sooner lost the places he
was so ill qualified to fill, and unfurled the banners
of faction, than he was metamorphosed into
a pattern of public virtue; the very people who
reviled him before, now extolled him to the
skies, as a wise, experienced statesman, chief
pillar of the Protestant succession, and corner
stone of English liberty. I should be glad to
know how Mr. Barton reconciles these contradictions,
without obliging us to resign all title
to the privilege of common sense.” My dear
sir, (answered Barton) I don't pretend to justify
the extravagations of the multitude; who, I
suppose, were as wild in their former censure, as
in their present praise: but I shall be very glad
to attend you on Thursday next to his grace's
levee; where, I'm afraid, we shall not be crowded
with company; for, yon know, there's a
wide difference between his present office of president
of the council, and his former post of first
lord commissioner of the treasury.” 
This communicative friend having announced
all the remarkable characters of both sexes, that
appeared at court, we resolved to adjourn, and retired. 
At the foot of the stair-case, there was a
crowd of lacqueys and chairmen, and in the midst
of them stood Humphry Clinker, exalted upon a
stool, with his hat in one, hand and a paper in the
other, in the act of holding forth to the people— 
Before we could inquire into the meaning of this
exhibition, he perceived his master, thrust the paper
into his pocket, descended from his elevation,
bolted through the crowd, and brought up the carriage
to the gate. 
My uncle said nothing till we were seated, when
after having looked at me earnestly for some time,
he burst out a-laughing, and asked if I knew upon
what subject Glinker was holding forth to the mob? 

—“If (said he) the fellow is turned mountebank,
I must turn him out of my service, otherwise
he'll make Merry Andrews of us all—” I observed
that, in all probability, he had studied medicine
under his master, who was a farrier.— 
At dinner, the 'squire asked him, if he had ever
practised physic? “Yes, an please your honour, (said
he) among brute beasts; but I never meddle with
rational creatures.” “I know not whether you
rank in that class the audience you was haranguing
in the court at St. James's, but I should
be glad to know what kind of powders you was
distributing; and whether you had a good
sale— “Sale, sir! (cried Clinker) I hope I
shall never be base enough to sell for gold and
silver, what freely comes of God's grace. I distributed
nothing, an like your honour, but a
word of advice to my fellows in servitude and
sin.” “Advice concerning what?” “Concerning
profane swearing, an please your honour; 
so horrid and shocking, that it made my
hair stand on end.” “Nay, if thou can'st cure
them of that disease, I shall think thee a wonderful
doctor indeed—” “Why not cure them,
my good master? the hearts of those poor people
are not so stubborn as your honour seems to
think—Make them first sensible that you have
nothing in view but their good, then they will
listen with patience, and easily be convinced of
the sin and folly of a practice that affords neither
profit nor pleasure—” At this remark, our uncle
changed colour, and looked round the company,
conscious that his own withers were not altogether
unwrung. “But, Clinker, (said he) if
you should have eloquence enough to persuade
the vulgar, to resign those tropes and figures of
rhetoric, there will be little or nothing left to
distinguish their conversation from that of their 

betters.” “But then your honour knows,
their conversation will be void of offence; and,
at the day of judgment, there will be no distinction
of persons.” 
Humphry gowing down stairs to fetch up a bottle
of wine, my uncle congratulated his sister upon
having such a reformer in the family; when Mrs.
Tabitha declared, he was a sober civilized fellow,
very respectful, and very industrious; and, she believed,
a good Christian into the bargain. One
would think, Clinker must really have some very
extraordinary talent, to ingratiate himself in this
manner with a virago of her character, so fortified
against him with prejudice and resentment; but the
truth is, since the adventure of Salt-hill, Mrs.
Tabby seems to be entirely changed. She has left
off scolding the servants, an exercise which was
grown habitual and even seemed necessary to her
constitution; and is become so indifferent to Chowder,
as to part with him in a present to lady Griskin,
who proposes to bring the breed of him into
fashion. Her ladyship is the widow of sir Timothy
Griskin, a distant relation of our family. She enjoys
a jointure of five hundred pounds a-year, and
makes shift to spend three times that sum. Her
character before marriage was a little equivocal; 
but at present she lives in the bon ton, keeps card
tables, gives private suppers to select friends, and
is visited by persons of the first fashion—She has
been remarkably civil to us all, and cultivates my
uncle with the most particular regard; but the
more she strokes him, the more his bristles seem
to rise—To her compliments he makes very laconic
and dry returns—T'other day, she sent us a
pottle of fine strawberries, which he did not receive
without signs of disgust, muttering from the
Æneid, timeo Danaos et Dona ferentes. She has
twice called for Liddy, of a forenoon, to take an 

airing in the coach; but Mrs. Tabby was always
so alert, (I suppose by his direction) that she never
could have the niece without her aunt's company. 
—I have endeavoured to sound Square-toes on this
subject; but he carefully avoids all explanation. 
I have now, dear Phillips, filled a whole sheet; 
and if you have read it to an end, I dare say, you
are as tired as 
your humble servant,
J. Melford. 
London, June 2.
