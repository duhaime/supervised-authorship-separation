Tho' nothing is more laudable
than a Firmness of Resolution; 
yet there is no one thing
more apt to bring us into Misfortunes,
than too inconsiderately
to form them: Whoever
fixes a Determination to
do, or leave undone any Action
of Importance, ought to
advise with Time, and deliberately weigh not only
all apparent Obstacles, but also all that may possibly
arise either to thwart the present Intention, or
obligate Repentance, if compleated. If the most
lively and penetrating Wit that ever was known,
a Wisdom wonderful in Youth, a Depth of Learning,
which scarce any of the Fair Sex could boast, 

an elevated Genius, and Sublimity of Thought, a
Soul composed of Honour, Courage, Gratitude,
Generosity, Fortitude, and all those Virtues which
wear the Name of Manly, joined with Tenderness,
Sweetness of Disposition, and every Grace
with which the softer Specie attracts and charms,
could render the Person possess'd of them happy,
the lovely Subject of the following Sheets had been
as remarkable for her good Fortune, as the ill
Influence of her Stars have made her for the
contrary. 
Emanuella, so she was call'd, was born in
Porto-Rico, one of those Islands belonging to the
Spanish West-Indies, the Government of which had
been given to her Father, Don Alvarez, by his
most Catholick Majesty. She had the misfortune
to lose her Mother very young; but notwithstanding
that, and the Disadvantage of being educated
in a Place which could boast of but little Politeness,
the Care and Tenderness of Alvarez,
whose only Child she was, sufficiently compensated
for all other Wants: Perceiving her of an uncommon
Aptitude for Learning, he sent for the
best Masters to instruct her in the Latin, French,
and Italian Tongues, in which she became so perfect
in a little time, as also in Musick, Dancing,
Singing and Painting, that it was hard to say in
which she most excell'd: All the Muses! all the
Virtues! all the Graces! seem'd assembled in her
Soul, and inspir'd her Conversation with such different
ways of charming, that what kind soever
the Heart was most affected with, one might be
sure to find it there: As to the Beauties of her Person,
tho' few of the most celebrated ones could
boast of more, yet they were so far exceeded by
those of the interior Part, that I shall only say, the
Brightness of her Mind shone in her Eyes, enliven'd
all her Air, and whether she spoke, or look'd, or
mov'd, an awe-mix'd Sweetness spread it self around 

her, at once surprizing, pleasing and commanding. 
Adorn'd with all these shining Qualifications,
'tis easy to believe how dear she was to her
Father; but alas! it was not many years after she
was capable of knowing how happy she was, before
she lost it, the good Alvarez died when she
was about Fifteen, and it was from that fatal Moment
she might date the beginning of that Series
of continued Woe, which to the end of her Life
attended her; not but she was left in a Circumstance,
which, if Wealth could bribe ill Fate, was
sufficient to shield her from all the Vexations of
Life; but where a Person is destin'd to Misfortunes,
that which to others would prove a Blessing, is to
them a Curse; the Riches she was possess'd of,
serv'd but to attract a Number of pretended Friends,
but in reality only so to themselves; and the open,
noble Frankness of her Disposition, to lay her liable
to their Insinuations. She was so entirely free
from all Deceit and Artifice herself, that till a too
dear Experience convinced her, it was very difficult
for her to entertain a Belief there was such Baseness
in the World. 
But to go on gradually with the little History
I am about to make: The time of Mourning for
Alvarez was no sooner expired, than she began
to have a passionate Desire to leave the Place she
was in; the Delicacy of her Taste, joined to the
Improvements of her Education, made her uneasy
to continue where she could find nothing like herself
to converse with: besides, she had many Relations
at Madrid, and did not doubt but in so populous
a City, she should meet with Entertainments
suitable to her Genius. But how great was her
Vexation, when having prepared every thing for
her Departure, she met with an Obstacle entirely
unforeseen? Don Pedro, who by her Father's
Will, and her own Consent was made her Guardian, 

having the vast Fortune left her in his Possession,
could not think of parting with it so easily; 
he had a Son, whom ever since the Death of Alvarez,
he had been casting about how to ingratiate
to the Affections of this young Heiress: He
had indeed never hinted any such matter to her as
yet; nor had the intended Lover made the least
Declaration of a Passion, but it was only because
the one thought it early enough, and that there being
none of a superior Fortune in the Place, there
was little danger of the Offer being refused whenever
it should be made; and the Silence of the other
proceeded from a just Sensibility of his own
Demerits, and a true Respect for the engaging
Emanuella: for he had so little to recommend
him in his Person, that had his Soul been possess'd
of no greater Beauties, he would have been but
little regarded by all that knew him. His Stature
was very diminutive, his Limbs unhappily fram'd,
his Face cast in a Mould so rough, whoever look'd
on it, would have believed that Nature was absent
at his Formation, and left the Work to Chance; 
his very Voice was disagreeable, and his hesitating
Accents disgrac'd the Meaning he endeavour'd to
express. But in this unlovely Out-side, there was
a Jewel lock'd, whose Worth made full amends
for all his other Wants: He had excellent Sense,
Honour, Good-Nature, Generosity, and a thousand
other Virtues, better described by his own
Actions, than by the Pen of any Writer; but had
he been possess'd of more good Qualities than ever
Man pretended to, it could not be expected, that
with these interior Charms alone, a Lady so young
and beautiful, as Emanuella, could be influenced. 
She was indeed too good a Judge of Wit
herself, not to admire it in another; she acknowledged
Don Marco's, (for that was his Name)
and would often, notwithstanding the Misfortune
of his ill manner of Delivery, take Pleasure in 

hearing his Notions of things. She approv'd of his
Conversation, and had a very great Friendship for
him, till the Knowledge of his, or rather his Father's
Designs, reversed those favourable Thoughts,
and turn'd her all into Disdain. 
Being resolv'd to leave the Island with the
first Ship, she sent for Don Pedro, to advise
with him on the ordering her Affairs; she could
not think it safe or practicable to take her whole
Effects with her, and therefore thought it proper
to settle a Correspondence how they might be sent
after her, and in what hands trusted. Don Pedro,
who before had heard of her Design, thought it
now high time to discover the Secret he so long
had kept; and making her a low Bow: It is easy,
Madam, said he, for us to contrive means to send
your Fortune either to Madrid, or any other Place
you shall command: but it will not be so easy to
bring us to consent to the parting with your self. — 
You here receiv'd your Being;—here your Education; 
—are a Native—a Property of this Place; and
when you attempt to deprive us of that Right we
claim of your Presence, the whole Island would rise
in Arms; nor ought you to wonder if in so just a
Cause I should appear their Head, and force your
Stay, if soft Persuasion fails. The old Gentleman
was so little accustomed to Gallantry, that Emanuella
could not help laughing at these Words,
which she had not the least Thought were spoke
with any other Design; and perceiving he had done,
Well well Don Pedro! return'd she, I do not
doubt but in such a Cause as this I should be able
to make my party good against the Islanders, even
tho' you should appear their Head, as you threaten; 
but to shew you that I am not for War, if Peace
may be maintain'd on honourable Terms, pray
what have you to offer me here in lieu of those
Advantages I may expect elsewhere? That (reply'd
the other hastily) which if duly weigh'd, is of 

more Estimation than the whole World beside;— 
a Love accompanied by Sincerity, Constancy, and
Truth,—a Passion pure as the Zeal which warms
the Martyr's Breast, and everlasting as his Reward. 
All this was so far from giving her any Notion of
his Intention, that she had no other Surprize than
to find him in a Disposition so different from his
former Gravity; and believing he assum'd this Air
of Raillery only to divert her, would not baulk
his Good-Humour, but return'd an Answer such as
she thought suitable to the Occasion: If you were
in a Condition (said she merrily) I should be half
in hope it was of your Heart I had made so great
a Conquest; but as you are not yet, nor like to
be a Widower, I must entreat you to inform me
who it is has felt the Effects of a Power I never
had any Reason to have an Opinion of till now. 
Alas! Madam, (resumed the Don) it would ill become
the Autumn of my Age to attempt to please
the delightful Bloom of yours. —No, no, I would
not thus affront your Beauty. —But I have a
Son, whose Years will not disgrace the Passion he
professes—nor will his Suit, I hope, be unworthy
your Regard. These Words were like a
Clap of Thunder to Emanuella's Ears: the
manner in which they were spoke, joined to a thousand
little Passages, which when they happened,
were unheeded, but now all at once occurr'd to
her Remembrance, made her indeed believe
he meant what he said: But not yet fully assured,
And are you in earnest? cry'd she, (with a Voice
which testified both her Amazement and Indignation.) 
But he, whose Pride would not permit him
to be easily quell'd, was so far from excusing the
Presumption of his Application, that he rather
resented the little Deference she paid him. I know
not, resumed he, for what reason you should make
a doubt of it; there is not so great a Disparity
either in Birth or Fortune, to oblige you to think 

it strange I should offer at an Alliance. — 
You will leave me to Judge of that (answer'd
she, growing still more disturb'd) but I desire not a
Repetition of Genealogies, or a Calculation how
many Thousands either of us are possess'd of; 'tis
sufficient I am not ignorant what is in your hands
of mine, which I shall call for in, as soon as I
have consider'd of a Person proper to be intrusted
in such an Affair. She spoke no more at that
time, but continued walking up and down the
Room, by her outward Disorders making visible
the inward Agitations of her Soul: Don Pedro, who
had as much Cunning as Pride, observ'd every Motion,
and believing he had gone too far, endeavour'd
to mitigate the Boldness of his first Expressions, by
pleading his Concern for the Welfare of an only
Son, who could not live without her. But all he
could say to this purpose, was ineffectual to abate
the Indignation she had conceiv'd at so disproportionable
a Proposal, and the more he endeavour'd
at it, the more she grew incensed: till at last weary
of his Importunities, she desir'd him to leave her
House, and to prepare to make up his Accompts
with her by the next day; still assuring him she
was determined to take shipping by the first Opportunity. 
The Chagreen this Accident gave her,
was very great; she was disappointed in the Hope
of maintaining a friendly Correspondence with a
Man who had the Power of being very serviceable
to her in those Affairs which she was unexperienced
in, and which her Soul, delighting in sublimer
Contemplations, was unwilling to be amus'd in. 
Young as she was, she had a very good guess at
the Language of the Eyes, and easily found by
his, that she must expect no Obligations from him,
unless she could consent to come into his Measures,
than which nothing could be more averse to her
Inclinations, and consequently to her Designs; for
she was not of a Disposition to resolve on the one, 

without having first consulted the other: But tho'
she foresaw many little Vexations would attend
this Quarrel with her Guardian, yet she was far
from having any Suspicion, he had Baseness enough
in his Nature to act in the manner he was
already forming, and she soon after experienc'd. 
This sordid-temper'd Wretch always look'd
on every thing as his own that once he had the
Possession of; and to think of parting with so
much Money as the mistaken good Opinion of
Alvarez had entrusted him with, was such a
Dagger to his Heart, that he had resolv'd rather to
have recourse to any Measures, than to endure it:
He therefore contrived a Scheme, which by the
Vileness, as well as Cunning of it, one would
think could only be suggested by the Devil himself; 
he pretended that the late Governor, to maintain
himself in a Grandeur far beyond what either
his Post or Paternal Estate would allow, had at
several times borrowed vast Sums of Money of
him, some of which had been repaid, and for the
Security of the remaining Part, had made over his
Jewels, Plate, Houshold-Goods, and all other
Moveables to him, and sent Officers to seize immediately
on every thing. It was to no purpose
that Emanuella, surpriz'd as she was, had Presence
of Mind to argue on this score more like a
Person whom many Years experience had made
perfect in the Law, than a young Virgin, who
till this Hour ne'er knew what 'twas to hear a
Word which had the sound of Business. —But in
vain it was, that she represented the Illegality of
the Action, that she might justly sue them for a
Robbery, there being nothing really due to Don
Pedro, or if there had, he could not justify the
seizing on her Goods without a long Process, and
a Warrant proper for that End. They told her their
Business was not to examine into the Merits of the
Cause, Don Pedro must look to that; they had 

an Order for what they did, and if she thought
herself injur'd, she must make Appeal elsewhere. 
These sort of Replies were all her fine Reasoning
could draw from them, and she would not make
use of Reproaches to them, who she knew did but
as their Function required, but reserv'd them all
for the base Pedro. She several times sent to
his House, and other Places in search of him, but
he was no where to be found, and she was obliged,
without even the Satisfaction of Complaint, to see
her rich Furniture torn down by the Hands of these
robust Fellows, her Wardrobe ransacked, her Coffers
born away to the House of Pedro, while
herself was left without so much as a Bed to lie on,
or a second Suit of Clothes to change, for those
she had on. —She was not without Consideration
by what means she should seek Redress for so inhuman
and unexampled a Wrong; but alas! the
artful Villain had watch'd his Opportunity, the Persons
appointed by her Father's Will Trustees, were
neither of them at that time on the Island, and
the new Governour, not being yet arrived, there
was no body in whose power it was to examine
into this Affair; and against there was, he had
provided, if the worst should happen, some to
make Oath of Debts contracted by Alvarez,
and an Inventory of that Part of his personal Estate
which he had seiz'd (and might easily do, having
them in his Possession) to prove that they
were also assigned to him: Nor was this the Extent
of his monstrous Stratagem, as she was left
in a desolate and naked House, with only three or
four of her weeping Servants, not yet determined
where or to whom she should fly for Shelter, the
same Officers again broke in, and seiz'd her Person,
by the same Orders as they had done her Effects:
This last Stroke was infinitely more severe
to her, than all the rest had been; at Liberty, she
was not without hope of some Redress; but to be 

confin'd, and in the power of so inhuman a
Villain, gave her Apprehensions, which not all her
stock of Courage could enable her to sustain: She
fainted several times before they carried her away; 
the Fellows who at this Sight, hardened as they
were, began to feel Compassion, endeavour'd to
give her some Consolation, by telling her their
Orders were not to carry her to Prison, but to
the House of Don Pedro, who 'twas possible
would come to Terms of Accommodation with
her; but this was so far from working the Effect
they aim'd at, that it gave an Addition to her Perplexities. 
Oh! (said she) bear me to Prison, to Death,
to any thing, rather than place me under the
Roof of that consummate Villain! that Fiend more
black than Hell it self can furnish! He has no
Offers to make me, but such as, wretched as I am,
I'd sooner die than accept. —She vented her Passion
in many such like Expressions, but neither the
steddy Calmness which had appeared in her Countenance,
during the whole time of their removing
her Goods, nor the Agonies this last Surprize had
thrown her in, were of any Force to give a Turn
to her Condition; she was in the hands of Persons
who are not much accustomed to Remorse, or if
by Chance sometimes a little touch'd with it, know
how to give a check to Sentiments so contrary to
their Profession; she was obliged to go with them
to the House of Don Pedro, where their Commission
being ended, she was left in the Care of
some of his Servants; for neither he, nor his Son,
were in the way, or at least would not appear till
the first Emotions of her Passion were a little abated. 
But there is a vast difference between those
People who are incens'd at every little Accident
that happens to thwart their Inclinations, and those
whose Passions are not to be raised but on some
extraordinary Occasion;—the first as they are immediately
angry, so they are immediately reconciled; 

but the others, when once provok'd, are for
a long time, if ever they are prevail'd on, in the
same Humour. Of this last Sort was Emanuella; 
there was scarce a Probability, that had
Don Pedro recanted, and presently restored her
to her Liberty with the Treasures he had so unjustly
seiz'd, that she would ever have been brought
to forgive the Affront he had put upon her: Nor
indeed, can I see why she should; for tho' the
World is apt to give to such a Disposition the Epithets
of Malicious and Revengeful, yet as there is
certainly a Justice due to our selves as well as to
others, in my Opinion to renew a Friendship with
a Person whose Unworthiness or Baseness has once
forfeited it, is to put it in his power a second time
to deceive us, and no other than joining in our
own Destruction. Don Pedro, however, did
not make the tryal, but persisting in the Outrage
he had begun, prepared a Room for her, little
different from those in a common Goal; the
Windows of it were grated, and the Door always
kept close lock'd, except when any Person came
in to bring her Meat: nor was her Attendance
more respectful, he denied her to be waited on
by one of her own Sex; fearing, as she was afterwards
inform'd, her Tears and eloquent Manner
of expressing her Misfortunes might influence
them to pity her Condition, so far as to attempt
her Relief. —She had the Priviledge of indulging
her Melancholy undisturbed for two Days, at the
end of which Don Pedro, imagining the Violence
of her Fury pretty well exhausted, went to
make her a Visit. But to what a height does the
Sight of the Offender transport the nush'd Disorders? 
Emanuella. whose Philosophy had enabled
her to bear the Treatment she had met with
much more Moderation than the generality of the
World could have done, and depended entirely on
Heaven for the Redress of her Injuries, now lost 

all Patience; she upbraided him in Terms, which
if not severe enough for the Baseness he had been
guilty of, yet in such bitter ones, that she herself
thought alterwards were unbecoming the Mildness
of her Sex; and indeed, she had so great an Aversion
for Railing, that she has been often heard to
say, no Usage could excuse it:—And 'tis certain,
the Edge of her Invectives had been much less keen,
if Don Pedro, to his other Crime, had not in
this Visit offer'd an additional Indignity, which to
the Delicacy of her Soul was less pardonable than
his former ones. His earthy and groveling Disposition,
rendering him incapable of judging of the
Elegance of her's, made him affront her when he
meant quite otherwise: Among some other faint
Excuses for what he had done, he told her, that he
had no other way to force her to marry his Son,— 
but as soon as ever she consented to that, she
should not only be put in Possession of all, the Care
of Alvarez had heaped up for her, but also of
Treasures, which in no other Match she could expect. 
Not the poor Cottage Maid, who on the Mountain
Tops, exposed to Winter's Colds, and Summer's
Heats, watches her little Flock, nor knows what
Grandeur means, had less of Pride than Emanuella; 
yet here, the new, and ne'er till now experienced
Guest usurp'd the whole Dominion o'er
her Soul, and fir'd each Faculty with generous
Scorn—Wretch (cry'd she) who ignorant of Merit,
and far incapable of judging by what the Noble
Mind is sway'd, thou thinkest all Dispositions like
thy own, and conscious of thy own Depravity of
Nature, hast dar'd to hope thou hast the means to
force, or bribe me to thy Purpose;—but know,
presuming Fool, I view thy executed Spite, and
proffer'd Love with equal Eyes, and think them
both below my Anger, and fit Subjects only for
disdain. She spoke much more to the same purpose,
but Don Pedro knowing how entirely he 

had her in his Power, was not at all mov'd at it,
and doubted not but in a little time, when she found
there was no other Possibility of regaining her Liberty,
she would recede from her present Haughtiness
of Disposition: He did not fall to let her
know what his Thoughts were on this Occasion,
and expressed them in a Fashion so insulting, that
it encreased her Rage; 'till finding all she could say
ineffectual to bring him to any just Sense of the
Villany he was guilty, or to make him see how improbable
it was she should ever be brought to yield
to what he desired by such Methods, she at length
desisted, and resolved to speak to him no more. 
'Tis probable the old Don was a little nettled at
her Behaviour, but he made no shew of it; and
only telling her, if she would not be persuaded to
become his Daughter, he should take care to be so
far a Father to her, as to secure her Person and
Fortune from being lavish'd away on a worse
Choice, took his Leave. If a Condition such as
hers could admit of any Happiness, it was at seeing
him depart—the Sight of him was justly detestable
to her, and the more so, because being an utter
Enemy to Passion, she was almost as ready to condemn
herself for the Extravagancies it made her
guilty of, as he who had occasioned it: Nothing
could be more exemplary than her manner of supporting
this Confinement, the Excellence of her
Principles made her think it a Crime to revile even
her greatest Enemies, and the Greatness of her Spirit,
from any mean Complainings of her ill Fortune:
the Servant who was appointed to attend her, protested
he never saw her weep, nor utter the least
irregular Word; not that she was insensible of her
Mistortunes; not the most repining Mortal, perhaps,
ever felt any thing so nearly: being cut off,
in all probability for ever, from all the Pleasures her
Youth and Inclinations rendered her susceptible
of. —To be robb'd of all that Grandeur she was bred 

to,—to be denied the Conversation of her Friends,
—shut up from all Society,—and in the Power
of a Man, whose Actions testified him to be the
greatest of Villains, one who doubtless would never
let her appear in the World again, for fear of being
call'd to an Account for what he had done;—one
who, 'twas possible, if she yielded not to his Proposal,
might, to secure her Fortune, at last contrive
her Death:—These were terrible Reflections
for so young a Creature, yet I question, by the
account I have of her, if the most tenacious of our
Philosophers would have bore them with that Resignation
she did. 
About a Month was past in this Confinement,
during which time she had seen no human Face
but the Servant, and Don Pedro once; for
neither his Wife, nor Don Marco ever had presumed
to come into her Presence, which tho' she
was very glad of, she could not help wondering at,
not doubting at her first coming there but she
should be continually persecuted with the Declarations
of him whom her ill Fortune had made her
Lover: but she gave her self not much Trouble
what should be the meaning of it, amusing her
self as well as she could with Adventures she had
formerly read of; for her cruel Jaylor now denied
her the Satisfaction of Books. As she was sitting
one Morning pretty early in her usual Meditations,
she perceived a Paper lying close to the Door; she
started up, and going to take it, perceived by part
of it being still under the Door, that it had been
thrust in by some Body after it was shut: It was
impossible but the most incurious in such a Circumstance
would have been desirous of seeing what it
contained, and hastily opening it, she found it was
directed to herself, and contained these Lines: 


To Donna Emanuella.
I Heartily lament the unjust Calamity you, suffer,
but Pity being a poor Consolation, have forbore
to give you any Instance of it, till I had the
power of testifying it by something more than
Words. —If you have Courage enough to trust your
self with a Person you know not, you will find more
Honour than in those you have confided. —I have
provided Means for your Escape, if you think fit to
accept it; which let me know by a Line this Night
when all the Family are in Bed. —I know you are denied
the use of Pen and Ink; but if you can contrive
to let a String down from your Window, I will be underneath
and fasten one to it, which shall easily go in
between the Grate, and by that means I may also receive
your Answer, which I will wait the writing
of. —Depend that I have no other View in attempting
to serve you, than what is consistent with the
strictest Honour, whose Votary I profess my self, and
the injured Emanuella's 
Unknown Servant. 
P. S. Three distinct Whistles, about two Minutes
each time, shall be the Signal for you to let down
the String. 

The Surprize Emanuella was in at reading
this, cannot be well express'd; she was sensible
there were a great many in the Island, who would
make this Offer, if by any means they could have
known the Need she had of their Service; but
then the Improbability there was that Don Pedro
should let the Truth of this Affair reach the Ear of 

any one, and much more that they should have an
Opportunity of coming into his House, and conveying
this Letter under the Door of her Chamber,
quite stagger'd her Conjecture: she could not
help, however, believing that it was best for her
to accept it, since no Condition could be worse
than what she was in at present; and if the Person
who pretended to so much Honour should have
Principles never so different from it, she thought it
would be in her power to make a much better Defence
at Liberty, and in an open Street, than she
could do in this Confinement, in case Don Marco
(which she was in daily Apprehensions of) should
ever make any Attempts on her Honour. Resolv'd
therefore, to send an Answer of Consent, she felt
a greater Impatience for the approach of Night
than yet she had ever known for any Event: At
last it came, and between the Hours of Twelve and
One she heard the wish'd-for Signal: she had tied
her Girdle and Garters together to make a long
String ready, which on the third Whistle she immediately
let down, and with it drew up a little
Standish with a Sheet of Paper roll'd up in it, so
careful was the Person that no Material should be
wanting; she did not delay the use it was convey'd
for, but fill'd it in a moment with these Lines: 

To the generous Offerer of Life, Liberty, and Deliverance from a thousand Evils.
I will not give my self leave to suspect you any other
than you seem, lest I should by a needless Fear, render
my self incapable of accepting what you so
kindly offer, and justly me, it what future Mischiefs 

may befal me,—I glndly embrace your Proposition,
and am ready to do any thing to get free. —I wish
you had acquainted me with what Methods I should
take, for I can scarce believe there is a Possibility for
me to Escape: If there be, I beg the Knowledge may
not be deferr'd. —As you have been too generous to
let me know what Reward you expect for so meritorious
an Action; I will not pretend to offer any, since
it is only in the power of Heaven to make a Retribution
suitable to such exalted Virtue; and as that, I am
willing to hope, is your only Aim, so that it may be
immediately bestow'd in all the choicest Blessings of
that eternal Store-House, shall be the incessant Prayers
of, 
The (beyond Expression) obliged
Emanuella. 
P. S. The Moon shines to-night with an unusual
Splendor, I believe by her favourable Beams you will
have Light enough to answer my Impatience with
some little Hints by what Means I am to be preserved:
If you can without Danger of being observed, I beg
you will favour me so far; and that you may do so, I
let down your Standish, and let the String continue,
which I will not draw up till you give a Signal that
you have no further Occasion for it. 

No Whistle being given, she imagin'd he was
about to do as she desir'd, and would very fain if
possible have seen him, but the Grate was too narrow
for her to put her Head through: In a very
little time she heard the Whistle, and pulling up
the Ribband, found there was a Letter fix'd to it,
which contain'd these Lines: 


To Donna Emanuella.
The Place I am in not being so private as I
could wish, to particularize the Account you desire,
I entreat you will be satisfied with knowing
there is a Way found out to convey the Key of you
Prison by the same Means you receive this—; when
it comes to your Hands, it will be also accompanied
with a little Ladder made of Silk Cords, and you have
no more to do than to unlock your Door, and go into a
Room adjoining to it, which you will find open, and a
Window that looks into a Field, whence you may easily
descend, and at the bottom find him who will be ready
to conduct you where you please, and always glad of
an Opportunity to prove how very much he is 
Your most humble Servant. 
P. S. I believe you will have the Ladder and Key
to-morrow Night,—therefore do not neglect to watch
the Signal. 

If Emanuella was before confounded in
her Conjectures who it should be that appeared so
assiduous to deliver her, she was now much more
so; the Key of the Door assur'd her it must be by
the Assistance of some Person in the House she
was to be befriended: but all the Guesses she could
make, seeming improbable, she contented her self
to wait the Cerainty and the Probability that the
worst part of her Misfortune, her Confinement,
was near an end, gave her hopes that she should
also find Justice to remedy the others also; and
she past the remainder of that Night and the ensuing 

Day in Contemplations much more tranquil
than she had known since she had been in that
House. 
The next Night, much about the same Hour,
or something later, she heard the Sound she was
not a little impatient for; and letting down
the String found it came up with a weight which
told her before she saw it, what she expected had
not fail'd her: she received both the Ladder and
Key, to which was fix'd a little piece of Paper in
which was writ these Words: 
This Moment is the Crisis of your Fate—; be careful
not to lose it—unlock your Door as softly as you
can, and go into a Chamber on the left Hand, there
is a Balcony to which you may fix your Ladder;— 
do not mistake the Room, nor take any Light with
you—there are Horses to carry you where you shall
command. 
It was not without some little Apprehensions
this distressed Lady was about to put her self in
the power of a Person unknown, at such an Hour,
and one who she found had Conveniency to carry
her where he pleased, tho' he made her the
Compliment of leaving it to her own Choice; 
but the Exigence of her Affairs, the cruel Restraint
she was under, and the Probability of
greater Evils, presently banish'd them, and she
unlock'd the Door, and in every thing obeyed
Directions. The Balcony was so low, that she
might almost have jumped from it to the Ground; 
but the Gentleman who had taken so much pains
to serve her, ordered every thing as commodious
as possible. She found three Men on Horseback,
one of which alighting, lifted her up behind another,
and as soon as he was remounted himself,
desired her to say where they should conduct
her. —The Terror she had been in for fear of
Discovery while she was in the House, the Confusion 

to think she was in the Hands of Strangers,
and the Uncertainty to which of her Acquaintance
coming in that Hour, and Manner,
and the rest of her History, would be the least
liable to Censure, made her unable to reply; 
which one of them perceiving, said to the others,
The Lady may by her late Disorders be perhaps,
at present, incapable of determining on any thing; 
'tis therefore best to ride some distance from hence,
no matter which way, to prevent Discovery, till
the Power of Consideration is a little return'd to
her. Emanuella, willing to be farther from
Don Pedro, assented, and they all went five or
six Miles without stopping or speaking to each
other; a little House in which there was a Light
seem'd to invite them to bait at it, and it being
proposed, she having put her self so far into their
Power, thought it would discover a ridiculous Distrust
to scruple bearing them Company into it; 
and beside, she hoped her Curiosity would be satisfied,
by discovering to whom it was she was indebted
for her Delivery, for they were all muffled
in their Cloaks, that it was impossible for
her to know whether she had ever seen them before
or not; she had ask'd the Person she rode
behind, but he excused himself by telling her,
that he but obey'd his Principal in what he had
done, and without his Leave could not discover
any thing. This Secrecy a little alarm'd her, but she
was infinitely more so when being come into the
House, one of the Persons who she observ'd had
never spoke one Word during the whole time of
their little Journey, came into the Room, and
making a Sign to the others to withdraw, threw
off his Cloak, and discovered himself to be Don
Marco. Astonishment, and Rage, and Fear at
once possess'd her—she could not imagine for
what Reason he had acted in this manner, unless
it was contriv'd so, that in flying the Cruelty of 

the Father, she should run into the Danger of a
more shocking Treatment from the Son. —But
she had not time to utter any part of what she
thought, before, falling on his Knees, he accosted
her in this Manner: I see Madam, said he, with
what Regret you find your self under some Obligation
to any of the Family of Don Pedro; but
to convince you that Nearness of Blood does not
always occasion a Conformity of Principles, be
pleased to accept of this little part of what has
been so unjustly taken from you, and believe that
Marco will never rest till the whole is again at
your disposal. In speaking these Words he presented
her with a little Amber Box, in which she
had been used to keep her Jewels; which opening,
she found it still contain'd them, and also
Bills to a great Value. 'Tis hard to say whether
she was amazed, or pleased, at so unexpected a
piece of Generosity. The Esteem she formerly
had for him, which by the late Behaviour of his
Father, in which she imagined he had an equal
Share, had been converted into as great an Aversion,
now return'd with added Vigour, and she
rejoiced as much to find she had not been deceived
in her first Sentiments of his Virtues, as in
the Advantage she receiv'd from them; she expressed
herself so obligingly on this Occasion, that
Don Marco, who had the most sincere and disinterested
Affection for her that ever was, could not
listen to her without feeling a Rapture perhaps superior
to that which some who call themselves
Lovers are capable of knowing, even in the Gratification
of their utmost Wishes. I tremble, Madam,
said he, to appear before you, knowing
well, that without a Goodness near Divine, the little
Service I have now been able to do you, joined
with that of my whole future Life, is far too
small to engage Forgiveness for the Wrongs you
have received from my Family; and should not 

have presumed to discover my self, had not your
uncertainty how to bestow your self in safety,
obliged me to bring you to this House. You
would then, answer'd she, have been guilty of a
great Injustice to your self, and Unkindness to
me; for to be obliged in so profuse a manner,
and be ignorant where to pay our Acknowledgments,
is, to a grateful Soul, a Pain:—Besides,
I feel so great a Satisfaction in the Knowledge,
that when I entertain'd a Friendship from Don
Marco, I err'd not in my Choice, that I know
not if I could easily have pardon'd the delaying of
it. —Be assur'd, I cannot resent the Usage I have
met from Don Pedro with half that Warmth and
Spirit, as I shall endeavour to repay my Obligations
to his Son; and that the Virtues of the latter
have entirely disarm'd me from taking that
Revenge, which the Vices of the other would
else have demanded. Oh! I know, resumed Don
Marco, I know you are too heavenly good, to
wish Revenge;—but do not, I beseech you, do not
let the Memory of what I have done, nor the Belief
how much more I would do, were it in my
power, make you forget what is owing to your
self. —Use all proper means to oblige my cruel
Father to restore to you what he has so unjustly
taken from you; for much I fear he he will not
be prevail'd upon by gentle means to deal with
Honour by you. 
This generous Contest lasted for some Time,
nor would Don Marco give it over, till she had
promised to endeavour to do herself Justice; for
the Ataintment of which, both thought it the most
effectual Way for her to pursue her Intention of
going to Madrid, not only because if she continu'd
where she was, Don Pedro's Artifice might possibly
find her out, and contrive some Stratagem
again to get her in his power, but also that the
King was the only Person who had the Means of 

redressing her Grievances. He would needs accompany
her thither, attended by the two Men
whom he had brought to assist her in her Escape; 
but she opposed it, telling him she had already received
too many Obligations to endure the Thought
of laying herself under more: However, on his
representing the Dangers which of consequence
must attend a Person of her Sex in so long a
Voyage alone, and also the Necessity there was
for him to abscond for some time from the Rage
of Don Pedro, who 'twas probable would be
raised to the highest Pitch, on the Discovery how
his Designs had been circumvented by the very
Person for whose sake they had been form'd; she
was at last persuaded, it would not only be extreamly
commodious for her, but also far from
inconvenient for him; and since his absenting himself
from his Father was absolutely necessary, it
was as well for him to take a Voyage to Madrid,
as any other Place. This being concluded on,
Don Marco advis'd their immediate Departure,
judging it not safe to remain on the Island after
Day-Break, if by any means they could leave it
sooner; because he knew that in the Morning the
Fellow who had the Charge of the Key which he
had stole, would discover the Theft, and Emanuella's
Escape. One of the Men was therefore immediately
dispatch'd to the Sea-side, which they were
not above three Miles distant from, to see if there
was a Ship ready to go off, and to agree for the
Passage. By good Fortune there was one, which
on a more than ordinary Gratification, comply'd
with their desire of hoisting Sail as soon as they
came on board. 'Twould be needless to say with
how much Pleasure Emanuella heard this
News; the ardent Desire she had to leave a place
which had so little in it agreeble to her Genius,
joined to the late ill Treatment she had met with,
and the Apprehension of being subjected to the 

same again, is sufficient to make the Reader sensible
with what a Welcome she receiv'd the Certainty
of going. 
An Infinity of Contentment sat smiling on her
Countenance all the time of their Voyage; a fair
Wind, kindly Gales, and an unruffled Sea, wasted
her smoothly to her desired Port. —No chilling
Fears from within—No Omens from without— 
No secret Warning from her Guardian Angel, gave
a Check to the Satisfaction she felt at landing on
that fatal Shore where all her Peace of Mind was to
be wreck'd! where Mischiefs mult plied, concealed
in Clouds—numberless, nameless Ills—attended
her Approach, ready to burst with all their hoarded
Venom on her Head. 
She went immediately to the House of Don
Jabin, a very near Relation; where having made
herself known, and the Particulars of her late Adventure,
she was receiv'd with the highest Demonstrations
of Kindness—Both he and his Wife
assured her they would introduce her to the King,
who would doubtless do her Justice as to the Recovery
of that part of her Fortune which was still
in the possession of Don Pedro; and also issue
out his Orders for the Punishment so base an Action
deserv'd: But this not being done immediately, by
reason of his Majesty being at that time at the
Escurial, from which he did not return so soon as
was expected; an Incident entirely unforeseen
gave a sudden and vexatious Turn to this Affair,
and instead of being Plaintiff, reduced her to the
State of a Defendant. 
The cunning Don Pedro had no sooner discover'd
her Escape, than he immediately guess'd
to what place she was gone; and not doubting
but she would take such Measures as could end in
no less than his Ruin, had it presently in his Head,
how to preserve himself, and lay the Odium on
her: His Son being fled with her, and some few 

Bills he had taken from him to support himself in
his Absence, as well as what of right belong'd to
Emanuella, furnish'd him with Hints, which
the prompting Fiend that animated his inventive
Brain, took care to improve to form a Story so
plausible, that when heard, he should appear the
only injured Person, and Emanuella, and his
Son (whom now he hated) be esteemed no other
than Wretches who had contriv'd together to
rob him. Full of this inhuman Stratagem, and accompanied
by some vile Creatures, whose Evidence
he had purchas'd, as well as Bonds, Notes, and
Bills, counterfeiting the dead Alvarez's Hand
and Seal, he was at Madrid almost as soon as those
he follow'd: and being inform'd his Majesty was
at the Escurial, he waited not his coming to Madrid; 
but as Vice is always more indefatigable in the
pursuit of what it aims at, than a sincere and honest
Meaning, he went to wait on him there: And
his Age and artful Manner of insinuating what he
would have believ'd, wrought so far on the Royal
Ear, as to gain him the promise of having it in
his power to inflict what Punishment he pleased
on the Fugitives, who the cruel Politician had taken
care to inform himself where they might be
found, before he deliver'd his Petition, tho' he
concealed himself from either of them. 
Nothing therefore of his Arrival being
suspected, till the News of the King's Return,
put Don Jabin in mind that his Cousin should
make her Appeal; and she was dressing herself to
accompany him to Court, when a Messenger from
thence came to demand her Appearance. The
Surprize of so unlook'd-for a Summons, put them
all in a Consternation; and Don Marco, who
tho he did not lodge there, pass'd most of his Hours
with these, and was at that time present, discover'd
in his Countenance a Horror which extreamly added
to it. He was not ignorant of the thousand 

Artifices his Father was ever Master of, when he
was zealous for the Accomplishment of any Design,
and fear'd it was by some Emissaries employ'd by
him, tho' he was far from imagining he was there
himself, that something had been done to pervert
that Justice he might very well believe Emanuella
would claim. He would very fain have
persuaded her to suffer him to wait on her, that in
case it were as he suspected, he might be a Witness
on her Side, against whatever false Suggestions
should be offered to her Disadvantage; but that
generous Lady would by no means be prevailed
on to permit him. She told him she had not the
least Fear of making a Defence against all that
Malice could form to hurt her; and that she could
not consent a Person she call'd Friend, and one
who so justly had merited the Title from her,
should put so great a Constraint on himself, and
endure a Shame so poinant, as must rise from the
Accusation of a Parent, tho' never so unworthy
a one. She express'd herself in Terms so absolute,
that Don Marco, tho' with a world of Reluctance,
was obliged to obey: and accompanied
by Don Jabin, his Lady, and the two Servants,
who came over with her, and whom it was necessary
should appear, she went with a Courage infinitely
beyond what could be expected from her
Sex and Years; and wholly relying on the Justice
of her Cause, and the Care of Heaven, was farther
from any dread of the Event, than those to
whom it was of less Concern. 
Not but when she was conducted into the Palace,
and brought before the King, she was a little
alarm'd to see the base Don Pedro there: she
had however Presence enough of Mind to conceal
those little Emotions, which she was unable to repel
at so unexpected an Interview, and after having
paid her Duty to the Royal Presence; If I were not
already too well acquainted, said she, with your Insolence 

in maintaining the Injuries you do, I should
have hope, Repentance for those you have offered
me, had brought you here, so contrary to my
Expectation, to make me that Restitution, you
might be sure I should endeavour to force you to. 
There was not a Person in this Assembly, which
was very numerous, most of the Nobility being
come to congratulate his Majesty on his Return,
who the Appearance of Emanuella, and the
Sweetness which accompanied her Accents, assur'd
as they were, did not win to her Interest. —The
King himself seem'd to regard her with an uncommon
Stedfastness, as surpriz'd at the Graces which
attended her; and already suspicious of the Truth
of what had been suggested against her; which the
watchful Pedro observing, throwing himself at
his Feet, O my Sovereign! said he, if this Woman's
Soul had any Affinity with her exterior
Charms, she would at least have had Modesty sufficient
to have shun'd the awful Justice of this
Place—But I entreat you by that extensive
Power which makes Kings Gods on Earth, and by
that sacred Regard which to the King of Kings,
even from your self, is due! —By Honour,
Pity, Justice, by your own Royal Promise,
I conjure you not to listen to the false Insinuations
of this artful Siren, who comes no doubt
prepared with well-dress'd Perjuries, and smooth
Hypocrisy to evade her Crimes, and turn the
Sword of Vengeance against me. 'Twould be
very hard to describe any part of what pass'd in
the Soul of the injur'd Emanuella all the time
he was speaking in this manner; scarce could she
restrain the struggling Passions, which swell'd almost
to bursting in her Breast, and press'd so hard
for Vent, 'tis probable no Consideration would
have been of force to have with-held them, had
not the King with a Countenance somewhat perplex'd,
commanded him to be silent, telling him 

Justice should be severely executed on which ever
Party should be found the Guilty—Don Jabin
then, tho' very much confus'd at so strange a
Character of his Relation, thought it was his Time
to speak, and begg'd to know of what she was
accus'd? To which his Majesty assenting, commanded
a Person appointed for that purpose to
read the Heads of the Charge against her, as they
were taken from the Mouth of her Impeacher; 
which he presently obey'd, and with a loud Voice
surpriz'd all who had not heard it before, with the
Contents of a Paper which he pulled out of his
Pocket, and were as follows: 
A brief Abstract of the Crimes alledged against
Donna Emanuella, Daughter to Don Alvarez,
late Governour of Porto-Rico, an Island
in that part of his most Catholick Majesty's Dominions,
entitled the Spanish-West-Indies: Attested
by Don Pedro, and a great Number of
other Gentlemen upon Oath. 
I.
That the said Donna Emanuella, being privy
to the borrowing several large Sums of Money from
Don Pedro, by her Father; she, after his Death,
not only deny'd the Payment of them, but also pretended
there was much more owing to her from the
said Don Pedro. 
II.
That she seduc'd the Principles of Don Marco,
the only Son of Don Pedro, and living with him
in a riotous and dissolute manner, soon wasted the little
Wealth left her by Don Alvarez; on which
having recourse to Don Pedro for a Supply, and
being refus'd by him, she hir'd Assassins to murder
him, which he very narrowly escap'd. 
III.
That being, by the Order of the Magistrates of the
Place, on Don Pedro's Complaint, taken into Custody, 

and afterwards, by his Compassion and Charity,
preserv'd from being carried to Prison, and taken
into his own House on her seeming Repentance; 
she most ungratefully and wickedly contriv'd with his
own Son to rob him, which they did, and made their
Escape together to Madrid, with the Value of 5000
Crowns in Jewels, Bills and Money. 
So heavy an Accusation, loaden with so many
aggravating Circumstances, was sufficient to have
shock'd the most establish'd Fortitude; but Emanuella
was of that sort of Spirit, which exalts
it self the most, when most it is oppress'd: She
seem'd rather fuller of Disdain than Anger, while
she listned to the invective Scroll; and when she
saw Amazement sit on every Face, and those of
her own Blood confounded, and unable to offer
any thing in her Defence, she thus undertook to
plead for herself. Wonder not, Royal Sir! said
she, that conscious of my perfect Innocence, and
of a Soul too nice to bear such rude Suspicions,
as this monstrous Legend may perhaps create,
should lodge a Moment in the Breasts of any here; 
I now not wait the dull Formalities of Law, nor
ask Advice from learned Council drawn, but here
presume to make my own Defence, unaided but
by Truth—Permit me then, great King! to unfold
a Story must make my vile Accuser's Heart
grow cold within him, tho' warm'd with all the
Fires of Hell. She stop'd at these Words, by a
beseeching Air expecting his Permission to proceed; 
which being granted, she related the whole
Affair with the greatest Truth and Exactness, neither
extenuating her Enemy's Inhumanity, nor diminishing
the smallest Tittle of her own Behaviour. 
Don Pedro and his Accomplices, attempted
to interrupt her several times, but they were
commanded to be silent, and she was indulg'd in
all the freedom she could desire in vindicating 

herself, and accusing him. When she had finish'd
what she had to say, and the Witnesses she brought
with her examin'd, there were many, who, confident
of her Sincerity, spoke in her Behalf, but it
avail'd but little. Don Pedro's continued Asseverations,
the Number of his Evidences, and the
Advantage of complaining first, was very near
carrying the Cause against her; when Don Marco,
impatient that they stay'd, and full of fears, which
were indeed prophetick, left the House of Don
Jabin, and came with all speed to the Palace:
Partly by Persuasions, and partly by Force, he
got through the Guards, and entered the Room of
Audience just as his Father was entreating Sentence
might be past on Emanuella. Distracted
with what he saw and heard, he ran up
to the Chair of State, and begg'd it might be suspended
'till he was heard. The King, whose Sentiments
were yet unfix'd, gave him leave to utter
what he had to say; and deaf to all other
Considerations but those of clearing her, he wildly
spoke every thing he knew, and not only confirm'd
all Emanuella had averr'd, but many
more Particulars, of which she was ignorant, concerning
his Father's Barbarity; and among the
rest, that he really had a Design to murder her,
the surer to secure her Fortune; which horrid
Deed had certainly been perpetrated, had he not
timely contrived the Means of her Escape. But
all that he could urge, was in vain; the King
had been so much prepossest by Don Pedro of
a criminal Correspondence between him and that
Lady, that all he said appeared but as the Effects of
Gallantry to save a Mistress, who, considering her
Attractions, and the Misfortunes of his own Form,
it was no wonder he should risque every thing for. 
But, with what Words can so unexampled a Generosity
be prais'd! —Perceiving his Zeal to
serve, had rather work'd a contrary Effect; the 

noble-minded Marco resolv'd to give a fatal
Proof of his Sincerity, once more addressing himself
to his Majesty; Since that bad Man, who
gave me Being, said he, prefers a little shining
Dirt to Honour, Truth and Justice, and still persists
in his Design of ruining an innocent Virgin
entrusted to his Care: Thus! continued he, (drawing
his Sword, and falling on it, before any one
cou'd be quick enough to prevent him)—Thus! 
I release myself of the Duty of a Son. —Thus!
clear myself of the Crimes he has accus'd me
of—and Thus! I hope, convince your sacred
Majesty, and the yet unbelievlng World, that it
contains not a Jewel of more worth than Emanuella! 
—Hear, and believe me, Royal Sir!
tho' long, long I have ador'd the charming Maid,
conscious of my own Defects, I ne'er presum'd
to wound her Ears with the unwelcome Tale; nor
would I, 'till my last Moment, have ventur'd on
the Declaration, lest she should have hated, what
I'm too well assur'd she never cou'd have lov'd— 
If what I now have done, be an Offence to Heaven,
I hope you will all supplicate my Pardon:
for be assur'd, cou'd I have liv'd with Honour, or
with Peace, I had not died so early; but thus,
miserable in all, traduced by him, who ought to
have been the Protector of my Fame, justly despis'd
by her I wish'd to please, what could I do,
but—He could no more; he had given the
Wound with such a force, Death found an easy
Passage to his Heart, and soon deprived him of
the Power of Utterance. The King seemed prodigiously
alarmed at so uncommon a Testimony
of Affection. The Nobles look'd on one another,
struck with a sudden Horror. Emanuella
forgot her own Misfortunes to lament the
untimely Fate of so deserving a Youth. But Don
Pedro, who, tho' he stood still and motionless
for some time, as the Son's Barbarity had deprived 

him of, yet his hurrying Thoughts were
busy enough within, and turn'd all his Soul into
Confusion. —Long sleeping Conscience rouz'd
itself at length, and Self-Conviction, Remorse,
and all the Horrors of Desperation at once invaded
him. The wild Disorder scorning to prey on
any of the meaner Faculties, mounted to the Brain,
whirling Reflection from her Chain of Causes,
and quite disjointed Reason. In this sudden Frenzy
he uttered enough to make all that heard him
sensible of his Guilt; and the King, rightly judging
the Cause by the Effect, order'd him to be taken
away and secur'd till Time should discover
more. The Persons, who had appear'd Confederates
in his Design, were sent to the Inquisition,
there to be instructed in the Pains which perjur'd
Wretches like themselves are doom'd to bear in
another World; and Emanuella, and her
Friends, dismiss'd with those Encomiums which
her modest, but courageous Behaviour merited,
and a Promise given by the King's own Mouth,
that he would send an immediate Order for the
bringing over all that Don Pedro had so unjustly
seiz'd. 
This Adventure engross'd the whole Discourse
of the Town for a great while; and those who
were entirely Strangers to the Person of Emanuella,
were perfectly well acquainted with her by
Report. It is most certain, that her Virtues being
rendred by this publick Notice more conspicuous,
gain'd her a much greater number of Admirers
than otherwise she would have had, if she had
been no more seen, nor known than the Spanish
Ladies ordinarily are; but then the same Reason
created also an adequate proportion of Detractors. 
It is impossible to be remarkably distinguish'd,
without being as remarkably envied and hated,
especially by those of the same Sex; those who
found the greatest Improvement in her Conversation, 

and whom she most instructed in any of
those numerous Accomplishments, in which she
excell'd, secretly wish'd her less capable of affording
it; and those to whom she would not be seen,
as finding nothing in them worthy of her Friendship,
made it their whole Study, by all the little
Artifices they were Mistresses of, to lessen the
brightness of a Character whose Radiency discover'd
the Imperfections of their own; but hers
was too well establish'd for any of the Plots laid
against her to succeed, and she was so universally
applauded by all the knowing part of the World,
that it was sufficient to be accounted well thought
of by her, to engage the Reputation of being a
fine Woman—There were a great many, therefore,
who endeavour'd an Intimacy with her in
no other View; aiming only at the Character, and
neglecting the real Advantages which even those
who had been the least indebted either to Nature
or Education, might have found in an Acquaintance
with her. Nor did her Charity, and Generosity
of Disposition, extend only to the embellishing
the Minds of those to whom she profess'd
a Friendship; she could not think a worthy
Person under any Distress, without preventing
their Requests, by offering every thing in her
Power to serve them: And tho' the Fortune she
was at present possess'd of (till Don Pedro had
restor'd her the much greater part still in his Hands)
would not allow very conveniently of such Liberalities; 
yet she made Presents, which by their
Magnificence, had the Receivers been ignorant
from whom they came, would rather have been
imagin'd to flow from the Purse of a Princess,
than that of a private Gentlewoman. Donna Berilla,
youngest Daughter to her Cousin Don
Jabin, experienced her Bounty this way; for being
condemned much against her Inclinations to
a Nunnery (as in Spain, where a Grandee has a 

numerous Family, and not an equal Affluence of
Wealth, rather than match them below their
Birth, 'tis common to bestow one or more of
them in that manner, where for eight or nine hundred
Crowns they are provided for, for their
Lives) the generous Emanuella never left solliciting
her Father to suspend his Design, till she
should receive the remainder of her Fortune, as
the King had promised she should; assuring him,
that she would add to what he must be obliged to
give to place her in a Cloister, as much as would
make her equal to what he design'd for her other
Sisters. —Don Jabin was very loth to accept of
what she offer'd; telling her it was not only a much
greater Favour than he was willing to accept, but
also a Sum beyond what she could conveniently
spare; but she stopp'd his Mouth, begging him
to believe the Company of Berillia was cheaply
purchased at that Rate; and that for his other
Objection, she would easily make it up, by retrenching
Expences, less pleasing to herself than
that would be. 
This young Lady, so highly obliged to Emanuella
for this Proof of her Friendship, one
would think should never have obliterated the Memory
of it; but what Engagements are of force
to bind a Thankless and Ungrateful Mind! The
Aversion she had for a monastick Life, was soon
discover'd by the penetrating Eyes of her Cousin,
to proceed from her too great Affection for a young
Fop, who had nothing to recommend him to the
Approbation of a Woman of Discretion; and
talking to her with a little more warmth than
was usual on this Occasion, the other resented it,
as tho' she took that Liberty on the account of
what she had promised to her Father, and from
that Moment conceiv'd so great a Hatred, that it
grew uneasy to herself, because she had no Opportunity
to make the other feel the Effects of it— 

But being naturally as cunning as revengeful, she
conceal'd her Sentiments, and under the Mask of
Friendship, watch'd all her Actions, still hoping
some unguarded Minute might arrive, in which she
should be able to discover something to expose
her for. But not all her Dilligence could furnish
what she wanted; Emanuella, among the
multiplicity of her Adorers, behav'd herself in such
a manner, that might defy the strictest Scrutiny— 
all her Actions—all her Words—all her Looks; 
were govern'd by Prudence, and her malicious
Observer began to think it would be but Labour
lost to attempt to blast either her Virtue or Reputation. 
But alas! what Courage, what Discretion,
what cool Reserve, what Sanctity of Wishes can
defend the Heart, when once the God of Love
has found an Entrance there! that Tyrant Passion
lords it o'er the Mind, fills every Faculty, and
leaves no room for any other Thought—drives
Consideration far away—overturns Reflection— 
and permits no Image but itself to dwell in Fancy's
Region. The soft and tender Soul of Emanuella,
was a fit Temple for the enslaving Deity
to work his utmost Wonders in; and that she no
sooner felt his Power, was not because she was
less susceptible than others of her Acquaintance,
but that her Taste was more delicate, and so many
different Perfections as were necessary to attract
her Admiration, were very difficult to be found in
one Man. 
But Chance, or rather the Character of her
Charms, at last, brought a Person to her sight so
conformable to the Idea she had created in her
Mind, of what would please her, that she could
not presently distinguish whether it was still the
same delightful Vision her extensive Fancy had
dress'd up with all the Ornaments of Art and Nature,
or a real Substance. This most lovely, this
accomplish'd Gentleman, was call'd Emilius, a 

young Roman Count, who, having visited almost
all the Courts of Europe, happen'd at this time to
be at Madrid. He heard talk of Emanuella,
as of the greatest Wonder there; and having seen
all the other Curiosities, could not be satisfied to
leave the Place, without first being an Eye-witness
of those Perfections, which Fame so lavishly
reported. The Carnival coming on, he had hope
the Freedom of the Diversions used in that Season,
might afford him an Opportunity he long had vainly
languish'd for: Nor was he deceived. Emanuella,
who had not been accustomed to those
severe Restrictions of Behaviour the Spanish Jealousy
obliges the Females of their Family to observe,
was glad to lay hold of all Opportunities
to indulge the natural Gaiety of her Humour; and
accompanied by Donna Berillia, and other
Ladies of her Acquaintance, took part in all the
innocent Liberties the time allow'd. As they were
on their Rambles one Day, the watchful Count,
having Intelligence to whose House they were going,
found means to be introduced to the Master
of it: There happened to be a great Assembly of
Gentlemen and Ladies; but presently informing
himself which was Emanuella, he singled her
out; and in entertaining her, it was difficult to
say whether he gave, or receiv'd the greater Pleasure. 
She thought she had never seen any thing
so agreeable and witty, and he found her so far
surpassing all the Descriptions had been made him,
that tho' he had arm'd himself with all the Resotion
he was Master, of to regard her only with Admiration,
a tenderer Passion, in spite of him, soon
took up all his Soul—He could not gaze, without
admiring; nor admire, without desiring: But tho'
he found that he had very much receded from that
Resolution he had form'd before he saw her, yet,
till he saw her no more, he knew not how much— 
The height of Passion is never so truly experienced 

as in Absence—when from our longing Eyes,
the dear-lov'd Prospect flies—and our transported
Ears no more are blest—what Sense cannot bestow
Imagination's Force supplies, and brings the
Charmer to our ravish'd View—in spite of Distance,
we see! we hear! we grasp the lovely
Phantom, and taste, in Theory, ten thousand
Joys; till Reason, envious of the airy Bliss, chases
the bright Ideas from our Minds, and shows us
what we are. 
It was in these waking Dreams the amorous
Count beguil'd the Pains of Absence; but he was
too much of the Temper of his Sex to content
himself without a Happiness more substantial: A
perfect Knowledge of his own Attractions, and
frequent Experience how little it was in the Power
of any Woman to withstand the Influence of
them, made him not despair of finding the same
Sensibility in Emanuella as he had done in others; 
and imagined he wanted nothing but an
Opportunity to acquaint her with his Passion, to
inspire an equal one in her. The first Step therefore
that he made towards the ingratiating himself,
was to write; and, besides the being pretty
much accustomed to such kind of Billets, the Passion
he was at present fir'd with, help'd him to
dictate one tender enough to make her believe he
lov'd her, and too respectful, not to give her an
Opinion, his Designs was accompanied with the
stricted Honour. The Words were these: 


To the Incomparable Donna EMANVELLA.
Before I attempt to make known the impatitient
Dictates of my Soul, I would call all the
Aids of Wit—of pity-moving. Eloquence—and soft
Persuasion, to inspire my Pen, and teach me Arts to
which I am yet a Stranger: But that a secret Impulse
from within, bids me beware—tells me, Sincerity
disdains the Ornaments of Words, and looks most
lovely in her naked Meaning—Yet dare I not proceed
—O that my Guardian Angel—the Witness of
my Sighs, my Tears, my long Endurings, my restless
Days, and agonizing Nights, would leave his Charge
one Moment, and gently whisper in your Ear how
much I love—how much I suffer—At length the
Secret is reveal'd—O wonderful Force of Passion!
that while it drives, restrains, and speaks in Silence— 
I have confess'd I love—but, oh! what hope that you'll
permit me to attest this Truth by all the Services of
my future Life? —I have no Parents here, no
Friend, no Merits to excuse this bold Presumption,
and plead my Cause—but if Emanuella has
a Penetration, such as her Eyes, and Wit, have persuaded
me to think, that has already told her more
in my behalf than any Tongue could utter. The wild
Confusion in my Countenance—the Inconnexion of my
Words, when all surpriz'd! astonish'd! at the
Wonders of your Charms, I by a thousand ways betray'd
my Sense of them the few Hours I had the
Blessing of entertaining you, at the House of Don
Francisco—But I am too presuming—I fear
the excellent Emanuella, so used to conquer, reguarded
not a Triumph so unworthy of her Observantion 

—If so, I am indeed undone—but as 'tis natural
to wish Pity for remediless Misfortunes, be so divinely
good to allow me that; and if you chance to
hear of any unhappy Stranger, who falls a Martyr
to Love's powerful Flame, know it is he who living or
dying must be 
Your everlasting Votary,
Emilius. 
P. S. As I have pass'd many Nights in Contemplation
under your Window; permit me to disturb
an Hour's Repose of yours with the Musick this Evening
about Twelve or One o'clock. 

If what Emanuella felt from the first View
of Emilius was not yer arrived to a Passion, it
was enough to afford an infinity of Pleasure in
receiving this; which indeed, she was not without
some secret Expectations of, having, as he
judiciously enough observ'd, a Discernment which
seldom deceiv'd her, and easily inform'd her the
Emotions that appeared in his Face were occasion'd
only by her Presence; had she been as
quick in discovering the Humours of her own
Sex, she had escap'd the greatest part of the Misfortunes
which soon after came upon her— 
But as intimate as she was with Donna Berillia,
she forbore to acquaint her with this Affair,
not out of any suspicion she would betray
it, or make any Conjecture to her. Disadvantage; 
but, that perceiving she still carried on an Amour
with that young Spark already mentioned, she
thought to acknowledge herself a Lover, would
be to lessen the Prerogative she took in advising
the other. When Night came, she was very much
perplex'd how to get rid of her; and not being
willing she should stay till the Count came to the
Window, made a Pretence of being a little indispos'd,
and said she would go to Bed: But the 

officious Creature would not be so put off; and
being of a suspicious Temper, presently imagin'd
there was something more than ordinary in the
Case, that made her Cousin, contrary to her Custom,
so willing she should leave her; and besides,
she fancied she had been more thoughtful
of late than usual: Therefore putting all this together,
she resolv'd, if possible, to find out the
meaning of it; and imagining that this Night
might produce something which would tend to a
Discovery, she stir'd not from the Chamber; under
colour of taking care of her, till Emanuella
had been some time in Bed. Nor after she left
her, did she retire to her own Chamber; but
putting out the Lights, conceal'd herself in one
adjoining to her's, and from which she could easily
hear every thing that stir'd in it. She had not
long stood Centinel, before she was surpriz'd with
the Sound of Musick, which the Count had brought
to serenade his Mistress; she presently drew nearer
to a little Window that was in the Room, and
the Instruments being tun'd, accompanied a Voice,
which in very Harmonious Accents sang these
Stanzas: 


I.
From bright Emanuella's Charms,
 Ah! what Relief is found?
 She every way the Soul alarms!
And never fails to wound.


II.
Reason and Love, once Foes profess'd,
 Their utmost Forces join:
And make the most obdurate Breast,
 Confess her all Divine!


III.
Whether she speaks, or looks, or moves,
 Strange Passion she inspires!
Scorning the Arts of vulgar Loves,
 At once she awes and fires!



Emanuella was so much accustom'd to Gallantries
of this kind, that Berillia would
not have thought any farther of this, than any
other Serenade, had she not immediately after
the Song heard her open the Window, a Condescension
she never had made before, to any who
aimed at the Secret to please her: This was sufficient
to assure the Fair Inquisitive, that whoever the
Person below was, he was possess'd of an uncommon
Share of Emanuella's Favour, and made
her listen to the Conversation they presently after
begun, with all the Attention she was able to
discover, if possible, the happy Man so remarkably
distinguish'd. 
The Moment Emanuella appear'd at her
Window, Emilius, after having made a Sign to
those that accompanied him to retire, came as near
as he could to it; and in a low Voice, Can you
forgive Divine Emanuella! said he, my keeping
you from that Repose which might probably afford
you Entertainments more elegant than any
you can find abroad. I should be very cruel to
my self, answer'd she, and unjust to you, should
the too nice Reserves of the Country we are in,
oblige me to shun a Pleasure such as you have
just now afforded me; and as I had my Education
in a Place of greater Liberties, I shall make no
Scruple of continuing to indulge my self in all
those innocent ones I have been accustomed to; 
among which, I account a free Conversation with
Persons of your Sex, provided always their Behaviour
is what Honour and Decency will allow
of. The Man so favour'd (resum'd the Count)
must be unworthy indeed, who could not form a
Humour, if not born with him, suited to those
Principles which alone are capable of recommending
him to a Woman of less Virtue than the adorable
Emanuella. Oh! (continued he, with a beseeching
Accent) that Virtue, Honour, and Sincerity, 

were the only Requisites to make the Man possess'd
of them deserving Emanuella's Favour! 
The Man who can prove himself (return'd she)
possess'd of them, needs no other Qualification to
a Woman capable of distinguishing what is truly
Meritorious. A great deal more of this kind of
Conversation had doubtless pass'd between them,
had they not been interrupted by another Set of
Musick, who placed themselves under the Window
for the same purpose the Count had done. Emanuella,
willing to show the Deference she paid
him, bad him Good-night, and immediately withdrew:
Berillia, who had heard every Word
that had pass'd, made her own Construction of it,
and rejoiced that she had found something wherewith
she might let the World know Emanuella
was not without her Softnesses, as well as those
she took the liberty of blaming. 
But while she pass'd the time in a thousand
ill-natur'd Contrivances how to dress up the Affair
she had discover'd in the worst Colours, the Lovers
were employ'd in Contemplations far different
—Emanuella, who had been extreamly
charm'd with the Person and Behaviour of her new
Adorer, from the first time she saw him, was flattering
herself with the Idea of a world of Satisfaction
in the Proof of his Sincerity; and he, on
the other side, was no less transported, that she
seem'd willing to be assured he really was what he
pretended. 
The next Day, at both Morning and Evening
Prayers, she did not fail of seeing him; where
instead of paying her Devotions to Heaven, she
was busied in receiving them herself from the enamour'd
Count. At Night by Appointment she
entertain'd him from her Window, and thus it
continued for several Weeks; he still seeming to
encrease in the fervency of his Passion, and she
in believing it—But while in these Sense-ensnaring 

Amusements she suffered her Soul to be employ'd,
Berillia was not idle in reporting all she knew,
and a thousand times more, to every one she was
acquainted with; and in a little time 'twas grown
the common talk, that Emanuella, the reserv'd
discreet Emanuella, was fallen in Love with
a young Gentleman who was a Stranger in Madrid,
and from whom she could have no Assurance that
he was not already married, or under Engagements,
which in Honour she ought not to break
through. 
Emanuella, however was so much respected
by all that knew her, that no one would shock her
Ears with any such Discourses; till some of the
Old and Grave having got notice of it, and fearing
her Behaviour in this Point might serve as a Precedent
to their own Daughters and Neices, made no
Scruple to speak of this Affair to Don Jabin with
a good deal of Severity; and he to represent it
to her as a very great Solecism in that Decorum
she had hitherto so strictly preserved. She could
not hear him without a sensible Alarm; but alas!
she lov'd and was by this time too far enter'd into
the fatal Maze, to be able to extricate herself; there
appeared a Prospect of too much Felicity in continuing
her Conversation with the charming Count,
for her to resign it for any of those dull Considerations
he endeavour'd to inspire her with; and
besides all this, tho' she had a Wisdom far above
her Years, she in this point and in many others
also was apt a little too much to depend on her
own Strength of Reason; and the only Fault she
was guilty of, was Self-Will. 
The Adventure being so publick, she thought she
might now communicate it to Berillia; little
suspecting it was through her means it had first
been talked of: and that malicious and designing
Creature, glad of this Opportunity to make her
Conduct appear yet more blameable, sooth'd the 

Humour she was in, by all the Arts she was Mistress
of—She talk'd continually of the Count,
she praised his Shape, his Air, his Wit; and whoever
has known any thing of Love, will confess,
how dangerous it is for a Person, entring into that
State, to listen to such Discourses, of an Object
which already appears but too Aimable. Emanuella
suck'd in the delicious Poison, and thought
the deceitful Instiller of it her best of Friends: Why,
said she, should you deprive your self of the Pleasure
of conversing with the Man you love, and who has
the tenderest Regard for you, only to satisfy a busy
Crowd, who only because they are themselves incapable
of tasting those refin'd Delights which
Love affords, would deny them to another— 
These sort of Arguments won the Fair Deluded,
intirely to resolve on holding a Correspondence with
the Count: which Berillia perceiving, thought
she might now act as she pleased; and aiming at
her Ruin, took these Means to bring it about. 
It was no difficult matter to inform herself
where the Count lodg'd; which as soon as she had
done, she writ a little Billet to him, the Contents
of which were in this manner: 

To Count Emilius.
My Lord,
The Passion which Donna Emanuella regards
you with, is not so much a Secret, but that
I know, and pity it: I blame her not for loving
a Gentleman of your Accomplishments; but I have
too much Friendship for her, not to be angry that she
confines herself to a Reserve which makes her so unhappy; 
I would very fain have you come to a more 

perfect Understanding of each other's Sentiments; and
that you may do so, have contriv'd a may to bring
you together, in spite of those dull Formalities which
have hitherto kept you at a distance. Be at the Back-Gate,
which opens into the little Parade, about the
Hour of Twelve this Evening, and you shall be conducted
to the Presence of your adored Emanuella,
by her who would be a Friend to both, 
Berillia. 
P. S. I know not to what a height the Affectation
of Discretion may transport Emanuella, if she
should know I sent to you; and besides, it will be
better taken, if the Contrivance appears wholly your
own—Let this therefore be a Secret; be ready to
attest what you shall hear me say—and you may
be happy—Adieu. 

Whether Emillius was really possess'd
of all those Qualities which go to the making up a
perfect Lover, the Reader will be able to determine,
when his future Behaviour shall be related; 
but 'tis certain he had all the Assiduity, Impatience,
Ardency of Desire of the most Passionate, and
could not receive this Intelligence of a Friend so
unexpected, and so capable of serving him, without
an infinity of Transport—He watched the
Hour, and went according to appointment; where
he had not waited a moment, before Berillia
appeared to introduce him. He made her a thousand
Compliments for the Favour she did him; to all
which she made but short Answers, having other
Matters in her Head. —The Family not being
all in Bed, she told him he must be content to
divert himself in Contemplation, till she could find
an Opportunity to get Emanuella into the
Garden. He bow'd, and obey'd, only entreated
her to be as expeditious as possible, lest any body
coming to walk, as the Sweetness of the Evening 

might probably invite some one or other, he
should be discover'd: Which she assuring him she
wou'd, and placing him in an Arbour where he
was the least liable to be seen, left him to feast in
Imagination on the Pleasures he was shortly to
enjoy in Reality. 
She kept her Word, and he had waited but a
very little Time before he perceiv'd her returning,
and Emanuella with her: he restrain'd the
Transports of his bounding Heart, and continued
to conceal himself till he should receive his Cue
from Berillia; and perceiving they were coming
down the Walk which led to the Arbour he was
in, stood close behind the shelter of some Jessamin
and Fillaree, with which it was covered. As they
came pretty near, he heard Berillia say to her
fair Cousin, Why, my Dear, should you persist in this
Severity to your self and him you love? Had you
but heard with how much Tenderness—with
how much Zeal—he pleaded for Admittance, and
begg'd me to assist his Suit, the Suit of burning,
raging, desperate, dying Love, you could not— 
nay, you ought not to have denied him. But since
you have, answer'd Emanuella, somewhat peevishly,
why do you now upbraid me with it? Suppose
I had not, would you have forgiven me?
(hastily resum'd the other.) There is no need (said
she) of asking what I would have done, since you
have not put me to the tryal. Well then, (cry'd
Berillia, easily perceiving her Inclinations) suppose
I really, in pity of his Sufferings, have ventur'd
to admit him; suppose he is now in this very Garden
full of impatient Wishes, and trembling with
Desire to throw himself beneath your Feet; will
you consent to pardon what I have done? Emanuella,
whose Soul was full of disorder'd Emotions,
scarcely suffered her to bring out these last
Words, before, And is he here? she cry'd. I will
no longer hide it from you (reply'd Berillia) 

and whether you condemn, or thank my Conduct,
cannot but take the part of a Passion which to me
appears so truly meritorious—But 'tis in his
Words, those Words which contrary to the Laws
of Friendship, wrought me to introduce him, that
I must hope to be clear'd in your Opinion— 
Appear! my Lord (continued she, raising her Voice
a little) appear! and charm her to Forgiveness of
us both. She had no sooner spoke this, than rushing
from behind his leasy Screen, he threw himself
at her Feet, embraced her Knees, warm'd her
Hands with ten thousand burning Sighs, and missed
no Art of sost, seducing Love, to melt her
tender Soul, and make it all his own. 
As prodigious a share, as all who knew her acknowledged
her to have of Wit, she saw not that
these were common Arts, which those, least capable
of Passion, make use of whenever excited,
either by Interest or Vanity; and that both these
Inducements tended powerfully to draw an Attempt
of this kind on her, she might have known,
had she considered how much the Reputation of
having a vast Fortune would gratify the one, and
her well-known, and universally admired Perfections
the other. But, alas! not this Reflection,
nor the Remembrance that a thousand times she
had heard from others unmov'd, the self-same
things which now she listen'd to, had any Power
over her—She lov'd—and lov'd in proportion to
the Delicacy of her other Sentiments—Her Notions
were more refin'd—her Passion more elegant
than those of other Women; and having
been bred to believe Sincerity one of the highest
Virtues, she could not suspect a want of it in the
Man she had so good an Opinion of; nor deviate
from the Rules of it so far herself as to affect
an Anger she was far from being possess'd of— 
Her Words, her Looks, her every Action betray'd
the Wishes of her Heart—confess'd her Transport 

—and told him, that he could not sue in
vain. Berillia was infinitely satisfied in the
Observations she made, and that treacherous Creature
receiv'd a thousand publick Testimonies of
Gratitude from the one, and private ones from the
other, which she was far from deserving. 
The amorous Pair stay'd not a long time together,
lest any Accident should betray their Converse
to Don Jabin or his Lady, whom Emanuella
yet was very loth should know the Secret
of her Inclinations—but the persuasive Count
would not depart, without her Permission to return
the next Night in the same manner as he
had done this—nor would she have been well satisfied,
had he appeared less pressing—And they
took leave with less Regret than Lovers usually
do, because they both assured themselves of a zealous
Promoter of their common Happiness in the
Friendship of Berillia. 
Many Nights pass'd over as this had done,
and at last Berillia having brought things pretty
near to the pitch she aim'd at, under pretence of
waiting in the Garden to receive Emilius, would
let in her own Lover (who neither being approv'd
of by her Father, nor any of her Friends, she
could see but by stealth) and when she found Emanuella
and the Count were engag'd in a Conversation
in which a third Person might be spar'd,
she constantly retir'd to another part of the Garden,
and receiv'd the double Satisfaction of the
Company of the Man she lov'd, and the Probability
of undoing the Woman she hated. Not
that any thing had yet pass'd between those two
amiable Persons, but what was accountable to the
strictest Virtue; yet the Passion she found them
both possess'd of—the Opportunities she allow'd
them—the continual Hints she gave the
Count, not to let Modesty be his Enemy—and
the Artifices she daily, almost hourly, made use 

of to melt Emanuella's Soul, and turn her all
into Desire; gave her liberty (who knew Nature
pretty well) to imagine an unguarded Minute might
arrive, which might perfectly compleat her base
Design; and reduce the envy'd Fair to a Condition
both blameable and pitiable. 
They were now arriv'd to such a height of
Love confess'd, that the most binding Vows of
everlasting Constancy had pass'd between them— 
Emilius often press'd, that the Ceremony of
the Church might put it past the power of even
Fate it self to deprive him of the Blessing she had
made him hope. But Emanuella would by no
means consent, till the return of the Ships sent
for that purpose should make her Mistress of
that Wealth which was her Due. As she then was,
she might have look'd on a Marriage with the
Count as extreamly to her Interest; but as she
expected to be, the Advantage was wholly on
his Side: And among the other Niceties of
her Passion, this was one, never to endure to
be obliged to the Man she lov'd. Their mutual
Vows however, and her firm Resolution to
marry him assoon as this Affair was settled, gave,
as it were, a Sanction to much greater Freedoms
than otherwise he would have dar'd to have taken,
or she would have permitted; and at last,
O how dangerous is it to transgress, even the least
Bounds of that Reserve which is enjoined by Virtue
for our Guard! from one Liberty they ventur'd
on another, till rapacious, greedy Love,
too conscious of his Power, encroached on all,
and nothing left for Honour. 
Donna Berillia had too much Experience
in these Affairs, not to be perfectly sensible of
what had happen'd, tho' Emanuella's Modesty,
and perhaps already a secret Remorse, would
not suffer her to make any one a Confidant in
this Part of the Story; and the mischievous Wretch 

having so much of her Wish compleated, began
to study how she should bring about the remainder; 
that of exposing the Dishonour her Insinuations
had in a great measure help'd to occasion,
and bring on her unhappy Cousin, the Shame and
Misery, as well as Guilt, which waits on a too
fond Belief. 
Fortune seem'd to take Pleasure in assisting
her Malice; and before she could find an Opportunity
to execute any thing she had form'd, gave
an unexpected Shock, which without her aid,
would have made a Woman of Emanuella's
Temper, unfortunate to the last Degree; and it
was with an infinity of inward Torment she received
the News, that all those vast Possessions left
her by her Father, and which had been so long
detained by the Baseness of Don Pedro, having
been dispos'd of, and turn'd into ready Cash, and
Bills for the Convenience of Exportation, by a
sudden Storm were lost, and not above two or
three of the Sailors escap'd to bring the fatal Tydings. 
So dreadful a Misfortune wou'd scarce
have been supportable by most young Ladies; 
but Emanuella considered it in a deeper Sense
than barely to be reduc'd from one of the greatest
Fortunes to the meanest; she had never set any
higher Value on Wealth, than as it might be serviceable
to her Friends; and now, having one
who was dearer to her than her Soul—one to
whom she had made the greatest Condescensions,
and whose Estate she imagined was not very large,
and one whose Expectations would be strangely disappointed
in this Loss, made her regret it with an
inconceivable Affliction. She had delay'd marrying
him, 'till she was actually in Possession of what
she knew wou'd make him perfectly easy; and to
be certain it never wou'd be in her Power to make
him any other Presents than herself, gave her Agonies, 

which not all her Fortitude could enable her
to sustain with Patience. Had she been Empress
of the World, Emilius should have shar'd that
Grandeur with her; but she lov'd him with a Passion
too refin'd, to be content he shou'd share
with her an abject State of Life. Her Opinion
had set him in so noble a Light, that she doubted
not of his Love, Honour, or Generosity, and
assur'd herself that it would be wholly her own
fault, if the Vows he had made her, were not authoriz'd
by the Ceremony of the Church. 
The Night after this distracting News was
brought, she would not be persuaded to see the
Count; and when Berillia ask'd her what she
should say to him, she knew not what to answer. 
Confus'd, and wild, torn with a thousand different
Anxieties, sometimes bid her reveal the fatal Secret. 
—Then, with the same Breath, recall'd that
Order. —Tell him, I am undone, (said she.) Tell
him, that cruel Fate, envious of the Blessings of
his Love, has ravish'd me for ever from his
Sight. —And presently after, No, no, (resum'd
she) I will not have him know it yet. —I will
have the Satisfaction of taking one dear Adieu,
yet one more fond Embrace before we part for
ever. —'Tis possible my Grief may rise to that prodigious
Height as to destroy me—and at once rid
me of the Pain of Thought—of Memory— 
of curs'd Apprehension. Berillia all this while
seem'd to endeavour to persuade her to Moderation,
and entreated her not to shun his Presence; 
telling her, she was certain to lose her Sight, would
be an Affliction infinitely more inconsolable to
him than that of her Estate: But the Arguments
she made use of to convince her, she contriv'd
shou'd appear too weak to be of any Efficacy, desiring
nothing more than to be entrusted with a
Message to him, which she resolv'd to deliver in a 

manner little conformable to that in which it should
be given. 
Twice, or thrice, the perplex'd Emanuella
sat her self down to write to her belov'd
Emilius, and as oft lamented her Incapacity; 
the Emotions of her Soul were too violent to permit
any Coherence in her Words. —And after a
long debate within herself what would best become
her Passion, and her Honour, desir'd Berillia
to acquaint him with her Misfortune; 
and gave her leave to let him know she regretted
such a Disappointment, only as she thought it rendered
her more unworthy of him. Berillia
rejoyc'd beyond measure at this Opportunity of executing
what she design'd; assur'd her she would
do in every thing as she had commanded. — 
And by this means, said the cunning Ingrate, I
shall make a Tryal of his Constancy: For if Men
are by Nature so Self-interested as they are reported,
this Account I have to give him, will prove
his noblest Sentiments. The Time for his Approach
being arriv'd, broke off any farther Discourse; 
and she went into the Garden to receive
him, leaving the half-distracted Emanuella almost
drown'd in Tears. 
The impatient Emilius was waiting at the
Gate, full of a thousand transporting Reflections
on the past, and pleasing Expectations of coming
Joys, when Berillia open'd it to him, and delaying
to say any thing to him of what she had to
reveal, till she had brought him into the Arbour,
the happy Scene which had so lately blest him; 
she then began to accost him in this manner. My
Lord, said she, I have a History to relate so little
of a piece with those I have already given
you of Emanuella's Sensibility of your Merits,
that I know not if you will forgive me for
relating it. Emilius, whose Passion was infinitely
greater than what most of his Sex, especially 

after Enjoyment, are possest of, cou'd not hear
these Words, and miss Emanuella from the
place she us'd to be always ready to receive him
in, without an inexpressible Disorder; which he
could not presently overcome, enough to be able
to ask what it was she meant. The artful Traytress,
observing his Surprize, encreas'd it, by
speaking in this manner. —I see, my Lord,
(resum'd she) you cannot hear any thing which
offers at a discovery of Emanuella's Falshood,
without the utmost Concern: Nor do I wonder
at it, having been Witness of so many tender
Protestations of an ardent Passion on both sides. 
You may think it strange, perhaps, that I, her
Cousin, and her Friend, should tell you this— 
but what is there in my power to do, which may
conceal an Inconstancy, which, tho' I should invent
ten thousand Stratagems, in spite of me will
show itself? I might indeed have made some Excuse
for her not seeing you this Night, which
might have seem'd plausible enough; but what cou'd
I have said, which could have beguil'd your Impatience
in the succeeding ones? —Since then 'tis
what you must know, sooner or later, I thought
it the more generous part to acquaint you with it
early, and arm you for the Misfortune you will
doubtless hear of in a little time from other
Tongues than mine. The enamour'd Count felt
his Heart sink in him all the time she had been
speaking, and could hardly assume Spirit enough,
when she had done, to entreat her to let him
know, in few Words, the Accident that had befallen
him. I will, my Lord! said she,—but first
let me deliver the Meslage I received from Emanuella:
She bid me tell you, that having this
Day an Account of that Ship, in which her whole
Fortune was trusted, being lost, she cannot think
of marrying any Man, but one whose Estate can
make up for the Deficiency of hers, and that yours 

cannot, she has been inform'd: Therefore there
being a Necessity of breaking with you, thinks it
improper to see you any more—How! (interrupted
the Count) no more but so? a Necessity
of breaking with me—See me no more! 
Good Heaven! is it possible she can so suddenly
recede from that height of Passion she last
Night profess'd, and all at once degenerate into
Coldness and damn'd Indifference! —But you
mistake her sure, and what is Over-Tenderness
misconstrue Hate—You'll soon be able to judge
whether I do or not, (resum'd Berillia, affecting
an Air of Indignation)—But I shall
give my self no further trouble, but leave you to
the Proof. —With these Words she turn'd away,
and seem'd as tho' she would have gon out
of the Arbour; which Emilius perceiving,
and repenting of what he had said, catch'd hold
of her by her Gown, Stay, Madam, stay, (cry'd he;)
Pardon the Distraction of a Lover, and ease the
Pains you've rais'd by adding more—Confirm
the fatal Truth; tell me again my Emanuella's
lost—that she is unkind—indifferent—false— 
and kill me with the Sound. Forbid it Heaven
(resum'd she, softning her Voice and sitting down
again) that Love should have such Power over a
Heart like yours—Rouze, rouze, my Lord,
your Soul, exert the nobler Faculties, think of
her Deceit, Hypocrisy, Perjury, and forget her
Charms. Had she refused to marry you, thus fallen
as she is from all her Hopes, it had been a generous
Proof of Self-denial; but now 'tis all but
feign'd, she imagines seeming to shun, she more
engages your Pursuit, and expects to be press'd to
what she wishes—and she will yield, depend
upon it, if you insist on the performance of the
Contract. Still, still, (resum'd the impatient Count)
you speak in Riddles—But if ever Pity or Good-Nature
sway'd your Soul, let me conjure you, 

Madam, to explain. I will (said she) but you shall
swear first by every thing that's Holy, never to
utter to Emanuella or any other Person what
I am about to speak. I do (cry'd he) and may
just Heaven renounce me when I break it. Know
then (pursu'd she) that you have been deceiv'd,
betray'd into a fictitious hope of marrying one
who has been long since, if Vows have any power,
another's Wife: My self was present at the
Ceremony; but the unhappy Man was driven from
her Arms, e'er consummation of their Loves. 
Emanuella has a Heart too sensible of the
tender Passion to be long without an Object to
inspire it: in the short Interval you happen'd to
address her, you know to what a Length her Acceptation
of those Addresses has carried her— 
She veil'd indeed her looser Flame under a Promise
of Marriage, which I have already told you was
not in her power to make good: However it
served for a Pretence, believing (according to the
Mutability which is imputed to your Sex) you
would be well enough satisfied to decline your Claim
before the Return of the Ship—Her Expectations
there being crost by your Constancy, and an
Account she has lately receiv'd of the sudden Death
of her Husband, and the Loss of her Fortune, obliges
her to act the artful Part, and seem to be
averse to what is most her Interest to wish— 
But now, my Lord! (continued she with a well-counterfeited
Concern) I am arrived to the blackest Point
of all her Character, and what indeed induced me
to lay open all the rest—She has lately commenc'd
a shameful Conversation with a Person
whose Name I know not; but whom if you had
ever seen, you would with me acknowledge the
Depravity of her Taste—But not to grow tedious
in a Relation which can afford you but little
Satisfaction, she now, tho' not till now, designs
to be your Wife, and only waits your protesting 

not to live without her, to engage her yielding to
save you from Despair. Hell first shall seize her
(cry'd the Count, transported with the utmost Fury)
let her chuse a Fiend from thence, the fittest Paramour,
and make the Wretch she has chose her
Property, Berillia was in so much Rapture
at the Success of her Project, that it was very hard
for her to counterfeit any longer the Concern she
had put on for the Baseness of so near a Relation; 
and therefore having afresh engag'd his Vows of
Secrecy, told him a longer Stay might occasion
Suspicion in Emanuella; and receiving a thousand
Thanks from him for her friendly Caution,
took her leave, and went to Emanuella, with
the Story she had prepared for her. 
She found that unhappy Lady in the Posture
she had left her, extended on the Floor, in the most
cruel Storm of agonizing Grief, and desperate Love; 
but it was not in the power of all her Sufferings to
turn the Heart of this more than Barbarian; and
when she saw her rise to meet her, and heard her,
with an Accent which might have melted a Heart
of Adamant, enquire how 'twas her dear Emilius
look d, what 'twas he said, and a thousand
such Questions, which her Tenderness suggested; 
she sat for some Moments without making any Reply,
and when she did, it was in this manner: I
am infinitely troubled, my dear Cousin (said Berillia)
that you employ'd me in this Errand; 
I know not what to do, whether to relate the Truth,
or amuse you with a Falshood, be the most commendable:
but summon all your Fortitude, arm
your self with Courage to disdain the Baseness, the
groveling Disposition of sordid, ungrateful Man. Oh
Heaven! (cry'd Emanuella, ready to faint with
Apprehension) what means Berillia! what has
Emiljus done! All that can compleat a Villain,
(answer'd she) a most consummate Villain! 

Twice did the poor Emanuella swoon
away, before Berillia explain'd her cruel Meaning; 
but being eager to add to her Affliction, as
soon as ever she was in a Condition to listen to
what she said; Cease, dearest Cousin (cry'd she)
to mourn; rather let generous Indignation fire
your Breast, and arm you to disdain not only the
perfidious Count, but the whole Race of Man— 
The cold, insensible, regardless Traytor, heard
me with Tears recount your Grief, and speak
what you endur'd in the Necessity of parting with
him, with so unmov'd an Air, as tho' he were no
Man, or were unskill'd in his Sex's Arts of Dissimulation. 
At last he said he pitied your Misfortune,
'twas very unhappy indeed for a young Lady
to be without the means of keeping up the Grandeur
she was born to—but that you must study
Patience—that doubtless a great many Ladies
would be very willing to accept of you as a Companion
—and he hoped you would not want— 
bid me give his Service—and tell you that he
wish'd it were in his power to remedy your Misfortunes. 
—I had not Patience, but revenged the
Contempt with all the Revilings that a Woman's
Tongue, made keen by the most inveterate Malice,
could utter; but he appeared as unconcern'd at
this, as at any thing else I had said: and making
towards the Door, would fain have left me to
rail by my self: but I detain'd him for some time,
on purpose to vent the Fury I was possess'd of:
but at length he broke from me, and left me almost
breathless with the Struggle. Here she stopp'd,
expecting what Emanuella would reply; but
what that Lady felt at so unexpected, so shocking
a Relation, was too big for Words! silent the stormy
Passions rolled in her tortur'd Bosom, disdaining
the mean Ease of raging or complaining— 
It was a considerable time before she utter'd the
least Syllable, and when she did, she seem'd to 

start as from some dreadful Dream, and cry'd, It
is enough—in knowing one, I know the whole
deceiving Sex—Nor will I be a second time
betray'd—I'll hide me for ever from their Arts,
their soothing Flatteries, their subtle Insinuations— 
no more I'll hear, or see, or think of Man— 
The best is base—Emilius, Emilius whom
I lov'd is base! —Few Women but in such
a Circumstance would have writ, and upbraided
the cruel Destroyer of their Peace; but Emanuella's
Soul disdain'd those Testimonies of continued
Weakness, which however bitter they may
appear in the Expression, the Meaning still is Love; 
for the Indifferent give not themselves the Pains. 
It was of this Sort she now wish'd to be thought
by Emilius, and this Disposition help'd Berillia
to keep any Discovery how much she had
injur'd him from her Ears. 
Being determined never to be seen in Publick
more, she thought a monastick Life the fastest and
most convenient Retirement from the World; and
communicating her Intentions to Don Jabin
and his Wife, (letting them know no other, than
that it was the loss of her Fortune which had made
her of this Mind) they seem'd to think it the most
prudent Method she could use; and the very next
Day, without any other Consideration than the
flying from a World in which she believ'd it an
Impossibility ever to be happy, went into a Nunnery
of Pourclairs, making choice of that Order,
as being the severest; resolving to punish her easy
Belief, and the Condescension she had made to
Emilius, in as rigid a manner as was possible. 
He, who after he had left Berillia, and began
deliberately to weigh what had been told him,
found it very difficult to believe it; and tho' he
could not imagine for what Reason that young
Lady, who had so much befriended him in the
beginning of his Amour, should invent Stories so 

much to the prejudice of a Relation who lov'd
her, only to break off a Correspondence with him; 
yet he was sometimes about to write to Emanuella
in such a manner, as without Breach of the
Vow he had made to Berillia, would have
given him some light into the Truth: But the
Consideration, that if she was not guilty in the
manner she was accused, yet that the Ship in which
her Effects were, was lost, was past all doubt; and
that to a young Nobleman, full of Ambition, and
the love of Grandeur, was sufficient to abate the
Vigour of his other Passion: Beside, he had already
enjoy'd her; and where is the Man who
dies for a repeated Possession? —He therefore
forbore to examine any farther into the Truth of
the Affair; and tho' he had some melancholy Reflection
for a while, yet the natural Gaiety of his
Humour diverted them from doing him any great
Prejudice. 
The malicious Berillia triumph'd in having
remov'd a Person whose superior Graces
rendred her's unobservable, and revell'd in the
continued Possession of the Man she lov'd without
danger of Reproof. Emanuella was the only
unhappy Person; and it was neither in the power
of Time, Absence, Philosophy, or Religion, to
obliterate the Memory of Emilius, or assuage
her Sorrows. 

The End of the First Part.
