Narcissa being in danger from the brutality of
Sir Timothy, is rescued by me, who revenge
myself on my rival—I declare my passion,
and retreat to the sea-side—I am
surrounded by smugglers, and carried to
Bulloign—I find my uncle lieutenant
Bowling, in great distress, and relieve him
—our conversation. 
At certain intervals, my ambition would revive; 
I would despise myself for my tame
resignation to my sordid fate, and revolve an
hundred schemes for assuming the character of a
gentleman, to which I was intitled by birth and
education. —In these fruitless suggestions, time
stole away unperceived, and I had already remained
eight months in the station of a footman,
when an accident happened, that put an end
to my servitude, and for the present banished all
hopes of succeeding in my love. 
Narcissa went one day to visit Miss Thicket,
who lived with her brother, within less than a
mile of our house, and was persuaded to walk
home in the cool of the evening, accompanied
by Sir Timothy, who having a good deal of the
brute in him, was instigated to use some unbecoming
familiarities with her, encouraged by the
solitariness of a field through which they passed. 
—The lovely creature was incensed at his rude
behaviour, for which she reproached him in such 

a manner, that he lost all regard for decency,
and actually offered violence to this pattern of
innocence and beauty. —But heaven would not
suffer so much goodness to be violated; and sent
me, who passing by accident near the place, was
alarmed with her cries, to her succour. —What
were the emotions of my soul, when I beheld
Narcissa, almost sinking beneath the brutal force
of this satyr! I flew like lightening to her
rescue, which he perceiving, quitted his prey,
and drew his hanger to chastise my presumption. 
—My indignation was too high to admit one
thought of fear, so that rushing upon him, I
struck his weapon out of his hand, and used my
cudgel so successfully, that he fell to the ground,
and lay, to all appearance, without sense. —Then
I turned to Narcissa, who had swooned, and sitting
down by her, gently raised her head, and
supported it on my bosom, while with my hand
around her waist, I kept her in that position. My
soul was thrilled with tumultuous joy, at feeling
the object of my dearest wishes within my arms; 
and while she lay insensible, I could not refrain
from applying my cheek to her's, and ravishing
a kiss: In a little time, the blood began to revisit
her face, she opened her enchanting eyes,
and having recollected her late situation, said,
with a look full of tender acknowledgment,
“Dear John, I am eternally obliged to you!” 
So saying, she made an effort to rise, in which I
assisted her, and she proceeded to the house, leaning
upon me all the way. I was a thousand
times tempted by this opportunity to declare my
passion, but the dread of disobliging her, restrained
my tongue. We had not got an hundred
paces from the scene of her distress, when I perceived 

Sir Timothy get up and move homeward; 
a circumstance, which, though it gave me some
satisfaction, in as much as I thereby knew I
had not killed him, filled me with just apprehension
of his resentment, which I found myself in
no condition to withstand: especially when I
considered his intimacy with our 'Squire, to whom
I knew he would easily justify himself for what
he had done, by imputing it to his love, and desiring
his brother Bruin to take the same liberty
with his sister, without any fear of offence. — 
When we arrived at the house, Narcissa assured
me, she would exert all her influence in protecting
me from the revenge of Thicket, and likewise
engage her aunt in my favour. At the
same time, pulling out her purse, offered it as
a small consideration for the service I had done
her. —But I stood too much upon the punctilies
of love to incur the least suspicion of being mercenary,
and refused the present, saying, I had merited
nothing by barely doing my duty. —She
seemed astonished at my disinterestedness, and
blushed: I felt the same suffusion, and with a
down-cast eye and broken accent, told her, I
had one request to make, which if her generosity
would grant, I should think myself fully recompensed
for an age of misery. —She changed
colour at this preamble, and with great confusion,
replied, she hoped my good sense would hinder
me from asking any thing she was bound in honour
to refuse, and therefore bid me signify my
desire. —Upon which I kneeled, and begged to
kiss her hand. She immediately, with an averted
look, stretched it out; I imprinted on it an ardent
kiss, and bathing it with my tears, cried,
“Dear Madam, I am an unfortunate gentleman, 

who loves you to distraction, but would
have died a thousand deaths, rather than
make this declaration under such a servile appearance,
were he not determined to yield to
the rigour of his fate, to fly from your bewitching
presence, and bury his presumptuous
passion in eternal silence.” With these words
I rose and went away, before she could recover
her spirits so far as to make any reply. —My first
care was to go and consult Mrs. Sagely, with
whom I had maintained a friendly correspondence
ever since I left her house. When she understood
my situation, the good woman, with
real concern, condoled me on my unhappy fate,
and approved of my resolution to leave the country,
being perfectly well acquainted with the barbarous
disposition of my rival, “who by this
time (said she) has no doubt meditated a
scheme of revenge. —Indeed, I cannot see how
you will be able to elude his vengeance: being
himself in the commission, he will immediately
grant warrants for apprehending
you; and as almost all the people in this country
are dependant on him or his friend, it
will be impossible for you to find shelter among
them: If you should be apprehended,
he will commit you to jail, where you may
possibly languish in great misery till the next
assizes, and then be transported for assaulting
a magistrate.” —While she thus warned me of
my danger, we heard a knocking at the door,
which threw us both into great consternation,
as in all probability, it was occasioned by my
pursuers; whereupon this generous old lady, putting
two guineas into my hand, with tears in her
eyes, bid me, for God's sake, get out at the back 

door, and consult my safety as providence should
direct me. —There was no time for deliberation. 
—I followed her advice, and escaped by the benefit
of a dark night, to the sea-side, where
while I ruminated on my next excursion, I was
all of a sudden surrounded by armed men, who,
having bound my hands and feet, bid me make
no noise, on pain of being shot, and carried me
on board of a vessel, which I soon perceived to
be a smuggling cutter. —This discovery gave me
some satisfaction at first, because I concluded
myself safe from the resentment of Sir Timothy: 
But when I found myself in the hands of ruffians,
who threatned to execute me for a spy,
I would have thought myself happily quit for a
year's imprisonment, or even transportation. — 
It was in vain for me to protest my innocence: 
I could not persuade them that I had taken a solitary
walk to their haunt, at such an hour, merely
for my own amusement; and I did not think
it my interest to disclose the true cause of my retreat,
because I was afraid they would have
made their peace with justice by surrendering me
to the penalty of the law. —What confirmed
their suspicion was, the appearance of a Custom-house
yacht, which gave them chace, and had
well-nigh made a prize of their vessel; when
they were delivered from their fears by a thick fog,
which effectually screened them, and favoured their
arrival at Buloign. —But before they got out of
fight of their pursuer, they held a council of war
about me, whom some of the most ferocious among
them, would have thrown overboard, as a
traitor who had betrayed them to their enemies; 
but others more considerate, alledged, that if
they put me to death, and should afterwards be 

taken, they could expect no mercy from the
legislature, which would never pardon outlawry
aggravated by murder. —It was therefore determined
by a plurality of votes, that I should be
set on shore in France, and left to find my
passage back to England, as I should think proper,
which would be punishment sufficient for the
bare suspicion of a crime in itself not capital. — 
Although this favourable determination gave me
great pleasure, the apprehension of being robbed
would not suffer me to be perfectly at ease: To
prevent this calamity, as soon as I was untied,
in consequence of the foresaid decision, I tore
a small hole in one of my stockings, into which
I dropped six guineas, reserving half a piece and
some silver in my pocket, that finding something,
they might not be tempted to make any further inquiry. 
—This was a very necessary precaution, for
when we came within sight of the French shore,
one of the smugglers told me, I must pay for
my passage. —To this I replied, that my passage
was none of my own seeking; therefore they
could not expect a reward from me for transporting
me into a strange country by force. —“Damme!
(said the outlaw) none of your palaver; 
but let me see what money you have got.” — 
So saying, he thrust his hand into my pocket
without any ceremony, and emptied it of the contents: 
Then casting an eye at my hat and wig, which
captivated his fancy, he took them off, and clapping
his own on my head, declared, that a fair
exchange was no robbery. —I was fain to put up
with the bargain, which was by no means favourable
to me; and a little while after we went
all on shore together. 

I resolved to take my leave of these desperadoes,
without much ceremony, when one of
them cautioned me against appearing to their
prejudice if ever I returned to England, unless
I had a mind to be murdered; for which
service, he assured me, the gang never wanted
agents. —I promised to observe his advice, and
departed for the Upper Town, where I enquired
for a cabaret or publick-house, into which I went,
with an intention of taking some refreshment. — 
In the kitchin, five Dutch sailors sat at breakfast,
with a large loaf, a firkin of butter, and a cag
of brandy on the table, the bung of which they
often applied to their mouths with great perseverance
and satisfaction. —At some distance from
them, I perceived another person in the same
garb, sitting in a pensive solitary manner, entertaining
himself with a whiff of tobacco, from
the stump of a pipe, as black as jet. —The appearance
of distress never failed to attract my
regard and compassion; I approached this forlorn
tar, with a view to offer him my assistance, and
notwithstanding the alteration of dress, and disguise
of a long heard, I discovered in him my
long lost and lamented uncle and benefactor,
lieutenant Bowling! Good heaven! what were
the agitations of my soul, between the joy of
finding again such a valuable friend, and the sorrow
of seeing him in such a low condition! The
tears gushed down my cheeks, I stood motionless
and silent for some time; at length, recovering
the use of speech, exclaimed, “Gracious God!
Mr. Bowling!” —My uncle no sooner heard
his name mentioned, than he started up, crying
with some surprize, “Holloa!” and after having
looked at me stedfastly, without being able 

to recollect me, said, “Did you call me,
brother?” I told him, I had something extraordinary to communicate, and desired him to give
me a few minutes hearing in another room; but
he would by no means consent to this proposal,
saying, “Avast there, friend; none of your tricks
upon travellers;—if you have any thing to
say to me, do it above-board;—you need not
be afraid of being over-heard;—here are none
who understand our lingo.” —Though I was
loath to discover myself before company, I could
no longer refrain from telling him, I was his
own nephew Roderick Random. On this information,
he considered me with great earnestness
and astonishment, and recalling my features,
which though enlarged were not entirely altered
since he had seen me, came up and shook me by
the hand very cordially, protesting he was glad to
see me well. After some pause, he went on
thus: “And yet, my lad, I am sorry to see you
under such colours; the more so, as it is not
in my power, at present, to change them for
the better, times being very hard with me.” 
With these words I could perceive a tear trickle down
his furrowed cheeks, which affected me so much,
that I wept bitterly. —Imagining my sorrow was
the effect of my own misfortunes, he comforted
me, by observing, that life was a voyage in which
we must expect to meet with all weathers; sometimes
it was calm, sometimes rough; that a fair
gale often succeeded a storm; that the wind did
not always sit one way, and that despair signified
nothing; but resolution and skill were better than
a stout vessel: For why? Because they require
no carpenter, and grow stronger the more labour
they undergo. I dried up my tears, which I 

assured him, were not shed for my own distress,
but for his, and begged leave to accompany him
into another room, where we could converse
more at our ease. —There I recounted to him
the ungenerous usage I had met with from Potion; 
at which he started up, stalked across the
room three or four times, in a great hurry, and
grasping his cudgel, cried, “I would I were along-side
of him—that's all—I would I
were along-side of him!” —I then gave him
a detail of all my adventures and sufferings, which
affected him more than I could have imagined; 
and concluded with telling him that captain Oakhum
was still alive, and that he might return to
England when he would, to sollicite his affairs,
without danger or molestation. —He was wonderfully
pleased at this piece of information, of
which however, he said he could not at present
avail himself, for want of money to pay for his
passage to London. This objection I soon removed,
by putting five guineas into his hand,
and telling him, I thought myself extremely
happy in having an opportunity of manifesting
my gratitude to him in his necessity. —But
it was with the utmost difficulty I could
prevail upon him to accept of two, which he
affirmed, were more than sufficient to defray the
necessary expence. —After this friendly contest
was over, he proposed we should have a mess of
something: “For (said he) it has been banyan
day with me a great while. —You must know
I was shipwrecked five days ago, near a
place called Lisieux, in company with these
Dutchmen who are now drinking below; 
and having but little money when I came ashore,
it was soon spent, because I let them 

have share and share while it lasted. —Howsomever,
I should have remembred the old
saying, Every hog his own apple: For when
they found my hold unstowed, they went all
hands to shooling and begging; and because I
would not take a spell at the same duty, refused
to give me the least assistance; so that I have
not broke bread these two days.” —I was
shocked at the extremity of his distress, and ordered
some bread, cheese and wine to be brought
immediately, to allay his hunger, until a fricassee
of chickens could be prepared. —When he had
recruited his spirits with this homely fare, I desired
to know the particulars of his peregrination,
since the accident at Cape Tiberoon; which were
briefly these: The money he had about him being
all spent at Port Louis, the civility and hospitality
of the French cooled to such a degree,
that he was obliged to list on board of one of
their king's ships, as a common fore-mast-man,
to prevent himself from starving on shore. —In
this situation, he continued two years, during
which time he had acquired some knowledge of
their language, and the reputation of a good seaman: 
The ship he belonged to was ordered home
to old France, where she was laid up as unfit
for service, and he was received on board of one
of monsieur D'Antin's squadron, in quality of
quarter-master; which office he performed in a
voyage to the West-Indies, where they engaged
with our ship, as before related; but his conscience
upbraiding him for serving the enemies of
his country, he quitted the ship at the same place
where he first listed, and got to Currasoa in a
Dutch vessel; there he bargained with another
skipper, bound to Europe, to work for his passage 

to Holland, from whence he was in hopes
of hearing from his friends in England; but was
cast away, as he mentioned before, on the French
coast, and must have been reduced to the necessity
of travelling on foot to Holland, and
begging for his subsistence on the road, or of entering
on board of another French man of war,
at the hazard of being treated as a deserter, if
Providence had not sent me to his succour. — 
“And now, my lad, (continued he) I think I
shall steer my course directly to London,
where I do not doubt of being replaced, and
of having the R taken off me by the lords
of the admiralty, to whom I intend to write
a petition setting forth my case: If I succeed,
I will have wherewithal to give you some assistance,
because when I left the ship I had
two years pay due to me; therefore I desire
to know whither you are bound; and beside,
perhaps, I may have interest enough to procure
a warrant appointing you surgeon's mate
of the ship to which I shall belong. —For the
beadle of the admiralty is my good friend; 
and he and one of the under-clerks are sworn
brothers, and that under-clerk has a good
deal to say with one of the upper-clerks, who
is very well known to the under-secretary,
who, upon his recommendation, I hope will
recommend my affair to the first secretary; 
and he again, will speak to one of the Lords
in my behalf: So that you see, I do not want
friends to assist me on occasion. —As for the
fellowr Crampley, tho'f I know him not,
I am sure he is neither sea-man nor officer,
by what you have told me, or else he could
never be so much mistaken in his reckoning, 

as to run the ship on shore on the coast of
Sussex, before he believed himself in soundings; 
neither, when that accident happened, would
he have left the ship until she had been stove
to pieces, especially when the tide was making; 
wherefore, by this time, I do suppose
he has been tried by a court-martial and executed
for his cowardice and misconduct.” — 
I could not help smiling at the description of my
uncle's ladder, by which he proposed to clime to
the attention of the board of admiralty; and tho' I
knew the world too well, to confide in such dependance
myself, I would not discourage him
with doubts; but asked if he had no friend in
London, who would advance a small sum of money
to enable him to appear as he ought, and
make a small present to the under secretary,
who might possibly dispatch his business the sooner
on that account. —He scratched his head, and
after some recollection, replied, “Why, yes,
I believe Daniel Whipcord the ship-chandler
in Wapping would not refuse me such a small
matter. —I know I can have what credit I
would, for lodging, liquor and cloaths; but
as to money, I won't be positive: —Had honest
Block been living, I should not have been
at a loss.” —I was heartily sorry to find a worthy
man so destitute of friends, when he had
such need of them; and looked upon my own
situation as less miserable than his, because I was
better acquainted with the selfishness and roguery
of mankind; consequently less liable to disappointment
and imposition.
