As &longs;oon as I arrived in &longs;ight of the front of the
hou&longs;e, my attention was excited by a light from the
window of my own chamber. No appearance
could be le&longs;s explicable. A meeting was expected
with Carwin, but that he pre-occupied my chamber,
and had &longs;upplied him&longs;elf with light, was not to
be believed. What motive could influence him to
adopt this conduct? Could I proceed until this
was explained? Perhaps, if I &longs;hould proceed to a
di&longs;tance in front, &longs;ome one would be vi&longs;ible. A
&longs;idelong but seeble beam from the window, fell
upon the piny cop&longs;e which &longs;kirted the bank. As I
eyed it, it &longs;uddenly became mutable, and after flitting
to and fro, for a &longs;hort time, it vani&longs;hed. I turned
my eye again toward the window, and perceived
that the light was &longs;till there; but the change which
I had noticed was occa&longs;ioned by a change in the
po&longs;ition of the lamp or candle within. Hence,
that &longs;ome per&longs;on was there was an unavoidable
inference.
I pau&longs;ed to deliberate on the propriety of advancing.
Might I not advance cautiou&longs;ly, and,
therefore, without danger? Might I not knock at
the door, or call, and be apprized of the nature of
my vi&longs;itant before I entered? I approached and
li&longs;tened at the door, but could hear nothing. I
knocked at fir&longs;t timidly, but afterwards with loudness.
My &longs;ignals were unnoticed. I &longs;tepped back
and looked, but the light was no longer di&longs;cernible.




Was it &longs;uddenly extingui&longs;hed by a human agent?
What purpo&longs;e but concealment was intended?
Why was the illumination produced, to be thus
&longs;uddenly brought to an end? And why, &longs;ince &longs;ome
one was there, had &longs;ilence been ob&longs;erved?
The&longs;e were que&longs;tions, the &longs;olution of which may
be readily &longs;uppo&longs;ed to be entangled with danger.
Would not this danger, when mea&longs;ured by a woman's
fears, expand into gigantic dimen&longs;ions?
Menaces of death; the &longs;tunning exertions of a
warning voice; the known and unknown attributes
of Carwin; our recent interview in this chamber;
the pre-appointment of a meeting at this place and
hour, all thronged into my memory. What was
to be done?
Courage is no definite or &longs;tedfa&longs;t principle. Let
that man who &longs;hall purpo&longs;e to a&longs;&longs;ign motives to the
actions of another, blu&longs;h at his folly and forbear.
Not more pre&longs;umptuous would it be to attempt the
cla&longs;&longs;ification of all nature, and the &longs;canning of supreme
intelligence. I gazed for a minute at the
window, and fixed my eyes, for a &longs;econd minute, on
the ground. I drew forth from my pocket, and
opened, a penknife. This, &longs;aid I, be my &longs;afe-guard
and avenger. The a&longs;&longs;ailant &longs;hall peri&longs;h, or my&longs;elf
&longs;hall fall.
I had locked up the hou&longs;e in the morning, but had
the key of the kitchen door in my pocket. I, therefore,
determined to gain acce&longs;s behind. Thither I
ha&longs;tened, unlocked and entered. All was lonely,
dark&longs;ome, and wa&longs;te. Familiar as I was with every
part of my dwelling, I ea&longs;ily found my way to a
clo&longs;et, drew forth a taper, a flint, tinder, and &longs;teel,
and, in a moment as it were, gave my&longs;elf the guidance
and protection of light.
What purpo&longs;e did I meditate? Should I explore




my way to my chamber, and confront the being
who had dared to intrude into this rece&longs;s, and had
laboured for concealment? By putting out the light
did he &longs;eek to hide him&longs;elf, or mean only to circumvent
my incautious &longs;teps? Yet was it not more
probable that he de&longs;ired my ab&longs;ence by thus encouraging
the &longs;uppo&longs;ition that the hou&longs;e was unoccupied?
I would &longs;ee this man in &longs;pite of all impediments;
ere I died, I would &longs;ee his face, and &longs;ummon
him to penitence and retribution; no matter at what
co&longs;t an interview was purcha&longs;ed. Reputation and
life might be wre&longs;ted from me by another, but my
rectitude and honor were in my own keeping, and
were &longs;afe.
I proceeded to the foot of the &longs;tairs. At &longs;uch a
cri&longs;is my thoughts may be &longs;uppo&longs;ed at no liberty
to range; yet vague images ru&longs;hed into my mind,
of the my&longs;terious interpo&longs;ition which had been experienced
on the la&longs;t night. My ca&longs;e, at pre&longs;ent,
was not di&longs;&longs;imilar; and, if my angel were not
weary of fruitle&longs;s exertions to &longs;ave, might not a
new warning be expected? Who could &longs;ay whether
his &longs;ilence were a&longs;cribable to the ab&longs;ence of
danger, or to his own ab&longs;ence?
In this &longs;tate of mind, no wonder that a &longs;hivering
cold crept through my veins; that my pau&longs;e was
prolonged; and, that a fearful glance was thrown
backward.
Alas! my heart droops, and my fingers are enervated;
my ideas are vivid, but my language is faint;
now know I what it is to entertain incommunicable
&longs;entiments. The chain of &longs;ub&longs;equent incidents
is drawn through my mind, and being linked with
tho&longs;e which forewent, by turns rou&longs;e up agonies
and &longs;ink me into hopele&longs;&longs;ne&longs;s.
Yet I will per&longs;i&longs;t to the end. My narrative may




be invaded by inaccuracy and confu&longs;ion; but if I
live no longer, I will, at lea&longs;t, live to complete it.
What but ambiguities, abruptne&longs;&longs;es, and dark transitions,
can be expected from the hi&longs;torian who is,
at the &longs;ame time, the &longs;ufferer of the&longs;e di&longs;a&longs;ters?
I have &longs;aid that I ca&longs;t a look behind. Some object
was expected to be &longs;een, or why &longs;hould I have
gazed in that direction? Two &longs;en&longs;es were at once
a&longs;&longs;ailed. The &longs;ame piercing exclamation of hold!
hold! was uttered within the &longs;ame di&longs;tance of my
ear. This it was that I heard. The airy undulation,
and the &longs;hock given to my nerves, were real.
Whether the &longs;pectacle which I beheld exi&longs;ted in
my fancy or without, might be doubted.
I had not clo&longs;ed the door of the apartment I had
ju&longs;t left. The &longs;tair-ca&longs;e, at the foot of which I
&longs;tood, was eight or ten feet from the door, and attached
to the wall through which the door led.
My view, therefore, was &longs;idelong, and took in no
part of the room.
Through this aperture was an head thru&longs;t and
drawn back with &longs;o much &longs;wiftne&longs;s, that the immediate
conviction was, that thus much of a form,
ordinarily invi&longs;ible, had been un&longs;hrowded. The
face was turned towards me. Every mu&longs;cle was
ten&longs;e; the forehead and brows were drawn into
vehement expre&longs;&longs;ion; the lips were &longs;tretched as in
the act of &longs;hrieking, and the eyes emitted &longs;parks,
which, no doubt, if I had been unattended by a
light, would have illuminated like the corru&longs;cations
of a meteor. The &longs;ound and the vi&longs;ion were present,
and departed together at the &longs;ame in&longs;tant; but
the cry was blown into my ear, while the face was
many paces di&longs;tant.
This face was well &longs;uited to a being who&longs;e performances
exceeded the &longs;tandard of humanity, and




yet its features were akin to tho&longs;e I had before &longs;een.
The image of Carwin was blended in a thou&longs;and
ways with the &longs;tream of my thoughts. This vi&longs;age
was, perhaps, pourtrayed by my fancy. If &longs;o, it
will excite no &longs;urprize that &longs;ome of his lineaments
were now di&longs;covered. Yet affinities were few and
uncon&longs;picuous, and were lo&longs;t amid&longs;t the blaze of
oppo&longs;ite qualities.
What conclu&longs;ion could I form? Be the face
human or not, the intimation was imparted from
above. Experience had evinced the benignity of
that being who gave it. Once he had interpo&longs;ed
to &longs;hield me from harm, and &longs;ub&longs;equent events demonstrated
the u&longs;efulne&longs;s of that interpo&longs;ition.
Now was I again warned to forbear. I was hurrying
to the verge of the &longs;ame gulf, and the &longs;ame
power was exerted to recall my &longs;teps. Was it possible
for me not to obey? Was I capable of holding
on in the &longs;ame perilous career? Yes. Even
of this I was capable!
The intimation was imperfect: it gave no form
to my danger, and pre&longs;cribed no limits to my caution.
I had formerly neglected it, and yet e&longs;caped.
Might I not tru&longs;t to the &longs;ame i&longs;&longs;ue? This idea
might po&longs;&longs;e&longs;s, though imperceptibly, &longs;ome influence.
I per&longs;i&longs;ted; but it was not merely on this account.
I cannot delineate the motives that led me on. I
now &longs;peak as if no remnant of doubt exi&longs;ted in my
mind as to the &longs;upernal origin of the&longs;e sounds; but
this is owing to the imperfection of my language,
for I only mean that the belief was more permanent,
and vi&longs;ited more frequently my &longs;ober meditations
than its oppo&longs;ite. The immediate effects
&longs;erved only to undermine the foundations of my
judgment and precipitate my re&longs;olutions.
I mu&longs;t either advance or return. I cho&longs;e the





former, and began to a&longs;cend the &longs;tairs. The &longs;ilence
underwent no &longs;econd interruption. My chamber
door was clo&longs;ed, but unlocked, and, aided by vehement
efforts of my courage, I opened and looked
in.
No hideous or uncommon object was di&longs;cernible.
The danger, indeed, might ea&longs;ily have lurked out
of &longs;ight, have &longs;prung upon me as I entered, and
have rent me with his iron talons; but I was blind
to this fate, and advanced, though cautiou&longs;ly, into
the room.
Still every thing wore its accu&longs;tomed a&longs;pect.
Neither lamp nor candle was to be found. Now,
for the fir&longs;t time, &longs;u&longs;picions were &longs;ugge&longs;ted as to
the nature of the light which I had &longs;een. Was it
po&longs;&longs;ible to have been the companion of that supernatural
vi&longs;age; a meteorous re&longs;ulgence producible
at the will of him to whom that vi&longs;age belonged,
and partaking of the nature of that which accompanied
my father's death?
The clo&longs;et was near, and I remembered the complicated
horrors of which it had been productive.
Here, perhaps, was inclo&longs;ed the &longs;ource of my peril,
and the gratification of my curio&longs;ity. Should I
adventure once more to explore its rece&longs;&longs;es? This
was a re&longs;olution not ea&longs;ily formed. I was suspended
in thought: when glancing my eye on a
table, I perceived a written paper. Carwin's hand
was in&longs;tantly recognized, and &longs;natching up the paper,
I read as follows:—
“There was folly in expecting your compliance
with my invitation. Judge how I was disappointed
in finding another in your place. I have waited,
but to wait any longer would be perilous. I
&longs;hall &longs;till &longs;eek an interview, but it mu&longs;t be at a different
time and place: meanwhile, I will write this




—How will you bear—How inexplicable will be
this tran&longs;action!—An event &longs;o unexpected—a &longs;ight
&longs;o horrible!”
Such was this abrupt and un&longs;atisfactory &longs;cript.
The ink was yet moi&longs;t, the hand was that of Carwin.
Hence it was to be inferred that he had this
moment left the apartment, or was &longs;till in it. I
looked back, on the &longs;udden expectation of &longs;eeing
him behind me.
What other did he mean? What tran&longs;action
had taken place adver&longs;e to my expectations?
What &longs;ight was about to be exhibited? I looked
around me once more, but &longs;aw nothing which indicated
&longs;trangene&longs;s. Again I remembered the clo&longs;et,
and was re&longs;olved to &longs;eek in that the &longs;olution of
the&longs;e my&longs;teries. Here, perhaps, was inclo&longs;ed the
&longs;cene de&longs;tined to awaken my horrors and baffle my
fore&longs;ight.
I have already &longs;aid, that the entrance into this
clo&longs;et was be&longs;ide my bed, which, on two &longs;ides,
was clo&longs;ely &longs;hrowded by curtains. On that &longs;ide
neare&longs;t the clo&longs;et, the curtain was rai&longs;ed. As I
pa&longs;&longs;ed along I ca&longs;t my eye thither. I &longs;tarted, and
looked again. I bore a light in my hand, and
brought it nearer my eyes, in order to di&longs;pel any
illu&longs;ive mi&longs;ts that might have hovered before them.
Once more I fixed my eyes upon the bed, in hope
that this more &longs;tedfa&longs;t &longs;crutiny would annihilate the
object which before &longs;eemed to be there.
This then was the &longs;ight which Carwin had predicted!
This was the event which my understanding
was to find inexplicable! This was the fate
which had been re&longs;erved for me, but which, by
&longs;ome untoward chance, had befallen on another!
I had not been terrified by empty menaces. Violation
and death awaited my entrance into this




chamber. Some in&longs;crutable chance had led her
hither before me, and the mercile&longs;s fangs of which
I was de&longs;igned to be the prey, had mi&longs;taken their
victim, and had fixed them&longs;elves in her heart. But
where was my &longs;afety? Was the mi&longs;chief exhau&longs;ted
or flown? The &longs;teps of the a&longs;&longs;a&longs;&longs;in had ju&longs;t been
here; they could not be far off; in a moment he
would ru&longs;h into my pre&longs;ence, and I &longs;hould peri&longs;h
under the &longs;ame polluting and &longs;uffocating gra&longs;p!
My frame &longs;hook, and my knees were unable to
&longs;upport me. I gazed alternately at the clo&longs;et door
and at the door of my room. At one of the&longs;e
avenues would enter the exterminator of my honor
and my life. I was prepared for defence; but now
that danger was imminent, my means of defence,
and my power to u&longs;e them were gone. I was not
qualified, by education and experience, to encounter
perils like the&longs;e: or, perhaps, I was powerle&longs;s
becau&longs;e I was again a&longs;&longs;aulted by &longs;urprize, and had
not fortified my mind by fore&longs;ight and previous reflection
again&longs;t a &longs;cene like this.
Fears for my own &longs;afety again yielded place to
reflections on the &longs;cene before me. I fixed my eyes
upon her countenance. My &longs;i&longs;ter's well-known
and beloved features could not be concealed by
convul&longs;ion or lividne&longs;s. What direful illu&longs;ion led
thee hither? Berest of thee, what hold on happiness
remains to thy offspring and thy &longs;pou&longs;e? To
lo&longs;e thee by a common fate would have been sufficiently
hard; but thus &longs;uddenly to peri&longs;h—to become
the prey of this gha&longs;tly death! How will a
&longs;pectacle like this be endured by Wieland? To
die beneath his gra&longs;p would not &longs;atisfy thy enemy.
This was mercy to the evils which he previou&longs;ly
made thee &longs;uffer! After the&longs;e evils death was a
boon which thou be&longs;oughte&longs;t him to grant. He




entertained no enmity again&longs;t thee: I was the object
of his trea&longs;on; but by &longs;ome tremendous mistake
his fury was mi&longs;placed. But how come&longs;t thou
hither? and where was Wieland in thy hour of
di&longs;tress?
I approached the corp&longs;e: I lifted the &longs;till flexible
hand, and ki&longs;&longs;ed the lips which were breathle&longs;s.
Her flowing drapery was di&longs;compo&longs;ed. I re&longs;tored
it to order, and &longs;eating my&longs;elf on the bed, again
fixed &longs;tedfa&longs;t eyes upon her countenance. I cannot
distinctly recollect the ruminations of that moment.
I saw confu&longs;edly, but forcibly, that every
hope was extingui&longs;hed with the life of Catharine.
All happine&longs;s and dignity mu&longs;t henceforth be banished
from the hou&longs;e and name of Wieland: all
that remained was to linger out in agonies a &longs;hort
exi&longs;tence; and leave to the world a monument of
bla&longs;ted hopes and changeable fortune. Pleyel was
already lo&longs;t to me; yet, while Catharine lived life
was not a dete&longs;table po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;ion: but now, &longs;evered
from the companion of my infancy, the partaker
of all my thoughts, my cares, and my wi&longs;hes, I
was like one &longs;et afloat upon a &longs;tormy &longs;ea, and
hanging his &longs;afety upon a plank; night was closing
upon him, and an unexpected &longs;urge had torn
him from his hold and overwhelmed him forever.
