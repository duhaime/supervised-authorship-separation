DEAR KNIGHT,
THE manner of living at Harrigate was so
agreeable to my disposition, that I left the place
with some regret—Our aunt Tabby would have
probably made some objection to our departing so
soon, had not an accident embroiled her with Mr.
Micklewhimmen, the Scotch advocate, on whose
heart she had been practising, from the second day
after our arrival—That original, though seemingly
precluded from the use of his limbs, had turned
his genius to good account—In short, by dint of
groaning, and whining, he had excited the compassion
of the company so effectually, that an old
lady, who occupied the very best apartment in the
house, gave it up for his ease and convenience. 

When his man led him into the Long Room, all
the females were immediately in commotion. — 
One set an elbow-chair; another shook up the
cushion; a third brought a stool; and a fourth a
pillow, for the accommondation of his feet—Two
ladies (of whom Tabby was always one) supported
him into the dining-room, and placed him properly
at the table; and his taste was indulged with a
succession of delicacies, culled by their fair hands. 
All this attention he repaid with a profusion of
compliments and benedictions, which were not the
less agreeable for being delivered in the Scottish
dialect. As for Mrs. Tabitha, his respects were
particulary addressed to her, and did not fail to
mingle them with religious reflections, touching
free grace, knowing her bias to methodism, which
he also professed upon a calvinistical model. 
For my part I could not help thinking this lawyer
was not such an invalid as he pretended to be. 
I observed he eat very heartily three times a-day; 
and tho' his bottle was marked stomachic tincture,
he had recourse to it so often, and seemed to swallow
it with such peculiar relish, that I suspected it
was not compounded in the apothecary's shop, or
the chemist's laboratory. One day, while he was
earnest in discourse with Mrs. Tabitha, and his servant
had gone out on some occasion or other, I
dexterously exchanged the labels, and situation of
his bottle and mine; and having tasted his tincture,
found it was excellent claret. I forthwith handed
it about to some of my neighbours, and it was
quite emptied before Mr. Micklewhimmen had occasion
to repeat his draught. At length, turning
about, he took hold of my bottle, instead of his
own, and, filling a large glass, drank to the health
of Mrs. Tabitha—It had scarce touched his lips
when he perceived the change which had been put 

upon him, and was at first a little out of countenance
—He seemed to retire within himself, in
order to deliberate, and in half a minute his resolution
was taken; addressing himself to our quater,
“I give the gentleman credit for his wit (said
he); it was a gude practical joke; but sometimes
hi joci in seria ducunt mala. —I hope, for
his own sake, he has na drank all the liccor; for
it was a vara poorful infusion of jallop in Bourdeaux
wine: as it's possible he may ha ta'en sic a
dose as will produce a terrible catastrophe in his
ain booels.”— 
By far the greater part of the contents had fallen
to the share of a young clothier from Leeds, who
had come to make a figure at Harrigate, and was,
in effect, a great coxcomb in his way. It was with
a view to laugh at his fellow guests, as well as to
mortify the lawyer, that he had emptied the bottle,
when it came to his turn, and he had laughed
accordingly: but now his mirth gave way to his apprehension
—He began to spit, to make wry faces
and writhe himself into various contorsions— 
“Damn the stuff, (cried he,) I thought it had a
villainous twang—pah! He that would cozen a
Scot mun get oop betimes and take old
Scratch for his counsellor.” —“In troth, mester
whet d'ye ca'um, (replied the lawyer) your
wit has run you into a filthy puddle—I'm truly
consarned for your waeful case—The best advice
I can give you, in sic a delemma, is to
send an express to Rippon for doctor Waugh,
without delay, and, in the mean time, swallow
all the oil and butter you can find in the hoose,
to defend your poor stomach and intastins from
the villication of the particles of the jallap,
which is vara violent, even when taken in moderation.” 

The poor clothier's torments had already begun:
he retired, roaring with pain, to his own chamber; 
the oil was swallowed, and the doctor sent
for; but before he arrived, the miserable patient
had made such discharges upwards and downwards,
that nothing remained to give him further offence; 
and this double evacuation was produced by imagination
alone; for what he had drank was genuine
wine of Bourdeaux, which the lawyer had
brought from Scotland for his own private use. 
The clothier, finding the joke turn out so expensive
and disagreeable, quitted the house next morning,
leaving the triumph to Micklewhimmen, who enjoyed
it internally, without any outward signs of
exultation;—on the contrary, he affected to pity
the young man for what he had suffered, and acquired
fresh credit from this shew of moderation. 
It was about the middle of the night, which
succeeded this adventure, that the vent of the
kitchen chimney being foul, the foot took fire, and
the alarm was given in a dreadful manner—Every
body leaped naked out of bed, and in a minute the
whole house was filled with cries and confusion— 
There were two stairs in the house, and to these
we naturally ran; but they were both so blocked
up, by the people pressing upon one another, that
it seemed impossible to pass, without throwing
down and trampling upon the women. In the
midst of this anarchy, Mr. Micklewhimmen, with
a leathern portmanteau on his back, came running
as nimble as a buck along the passage; and Tabby,
in her under petticoat, endeavouring to hook
him under the arm, that she might escape thro'
his protection, he very fairly pushed her down,
crying, “Na, na, gude faith, charity begins at
hame!” Without paying the least respect to
the shrieks and intreaties of his female friends, he 

charged through the midst of the crowd, overturning
every thing that opposed him, and actually
fought his way to the bottom of the stair-case— 
By this time Clinker had found a ladder, by which
he entered the window of my uncle's chamber,
where our family was assembled, and proposed that
we should make our exit successively by that conveyance. 
The 'squire exhorted his sister to begin
the descent; but, before she could resolve, her
woman, Mrs. Winifred Jenkins, in a transport of
terror, threw herself out at the window upon the
ladder, while Humphry dropped upon the ground,
that he might receive her in her descent—This
maiden was just as she had started out of bed, the
moon shone very bright, and a fresh breeze of
wind blowing, none of Mrs. Winifred's beauties
could possibly escape the view of the fortunate
Clinker, whose heart was not able to withstand the
united force of so many charms; at least, I am
much mistaken, if he has not been her humble
slave from that moment—He received her in his
arms, and, giving her his coat to protect her from
the weather, ascended again with admirable dexterity. 
At that instant, the landlord of the house called
out with an audible voice, that the fire was extinguished,
and the ladies had nothing to fear: this
was a welcome note to the audience, and produced
an immediate effect; the shrieking ceased, and a
confused sound of expostulation ensued. I conducted
Mrs. Tabitha and my sister to their own
chamber, where Liddy fainted away; but was
soon brought to herself. Then I went to offer my
services to the other ladies, who might want assistance
—They were all scudding through the passage
to their several apartments; and as the thoroughfair
was lighted by two lamps, I had a pretty good 

observation of them in their transit; but, as most
of them were naked to the smock, and all their
heads shrowded in huge night-caps, I could not
distinguish one face from another, though I recognized
some of their voices—These were generally
plaintive; some wept, some scolded, and some
prayed—I lifted up one poor old gentlewoman,
who had been overturned and sore bruised by a
multitude of feet; and this was also the case with
the lame parson from Northumberland, whom
Micklewhimmen had in his passage overthrown,
though not with impunity; for the cripple, in falling,
gave him such a good pelt on the head with
his crutch, that the blood followed. 
As for this lawyer, he waited below till the
hurly-burly was over, and then stole softly to his
own chamber, from whence he did not venture to
make a second sally till eleven in the forenoon,
when he was led into the public room by his own
servant and another assistant, groaning most woefully,
with a bloody napkin round his head. But
things were greatly altered—The selfish brutality
of his behaviour on the stairs had steeled their
hearts against all his arts and address—Not a soul
offered to accommodate him with a chair, cushion,
or footstool; so that he was obliged to sit down on
a hard wooden bench—In that position, he looked
around with a rueful aspect, and, bowing very low,
said, in a whining tone, “Your most humble servant,
ladies—Fire is a dreadful calamity.” — 
“Fire purifies gold, and it tries friendship,” cried
Mrs. Tabitha, bridling. “Yea, madam (replied
Micklewhimmen) and it trieth discretion also.” “If discretion consists in forsaking, a friend in adversity,
you are eminently possessed of that virtue,” 
resumed our aunt. “Na, madam (rejoined
the advocate) well I wot, I cannot claim 

any merit from the mode of my retreat—Ye'll
please to observe, ladies, there are twa independent
principles that actuate our nature—One is
instinct, which we have in common with the
brute creation, and the other is reason—Noo,
in certain great emergencies, when the faculty
of reason is suspended, instinct takes the lead,
and, when this predominates, having no affinity
with reason, it pays no sort of regard to its connections; 
it only operates for the benefit of
the individual, and that by the most expeditious
and effectual means; therefore, begging your
pardon, ladies, I'm no accountable in foro conscientiæ,
for what I did, while under the influence
of this irresistable pooer.” 
Here my uncle interposing, “I should be glad
to know (said he) whether it was instinct that
prompted you to retreat with bag and baggage; 
for, I think, you had a portmanteau on your
shoulder.” —The lawyer answered, without hesitation,
“Gif I might tell my mind freely,
without incurring the suspicion of presumption,
I should think it was something superior to either
reason or instinct which suggested that measure,
and this on a twafald account: in the first
place, the portmanteau contained the writings
of a worthy nobleman's estate; and their being
burned, would have occasioned a loss that could
not be repaired: secondly, my good angel seems
to have laid the portmantle on my shoulders,
by way of defence, to sustain the violence of a
most inhuman blow, from the crutch of a reverend
clergyman, which, even in spite of that
medium, hath wounded me sorely, even unto the
pericranium.” By your own doctrine (cried
the parson, who chanced to be present) I am
not accountable for the blow, which was the effect 

of instinct.” “I crave your pardon, reverend
sir (said the other) instinct never acts
but for the preservation of the individual; but
your preservation was out of the case—You
had already received the damage, and therefore
the blow must be imputed to revenge, which
is a sinful passion, that ill becomes any Christian,
especially a Protestant divine; and let me tell
you, most reverend doctor, gin I had a mind
to plea, the law would hauld my libel relevant.” 
“Why, the damage is pretty equal on both sides
(cried the parson); your head is broke, and my
crutch is snapped in the middle—Now, if you
will repair the one, I will be at the expence of
curing the other.” 
This sally raised the laugh against Micklewhimmen,
who began to look grave; when my uncle,
in order to change the discourse, observed, that
instinct had been very kind to him in another respect; 
for it had restored to him the use of his
limbs, which, in his exit, he had moved with surprising
agility. —He replied, that it was the nature
of fear to brace up the nerves; and mentioned
some surprising feats of strength and activity
performed by persons under the impulse of terror; 
but he complained, that, in his own particular,
the effects had ceased, when the cause was taken
away. —The 'squire said, he would lay a tea-drinking
on his head, that he should dance a Scotch
measure, without making a false step; and the
advocate grinning, called for the piper. —A fiddler
being at hand, this original started up, with his
bloody napkin over his black tye-periwig, and
acquitted himself in such a manner, as excited the
mirth of the whole company; but he could not
regain the good graces of Mrs. Tabby, who did 

not understand the principle of instinct; and the
lawyer did not think it worth his while to proceed
to further demonstration. 
From Harrigate we came hither, by the way of
York, and here we shall tarry for some days, as my
uncle and Tabitha are both resolved to make use
of the waters. Scarborough, though a paltry
town, is romantic, from its situation along a cliff
that overhangs the sea. The harbour is formed
by a small elbow of land that runs out as a natural
mole, directly opposite to the town; and on that
side is the castle, which stands very high, of considerable
extent, and, before the invention of gun-powder,
was counted impregnable. At the other
end of Scarborough are two public rooms for the
use of the company, who resort to this place in
the summer, to drink the waters or bathe in the
sea; and the diversions are pretty much on the
same footing here as at Bath. The Spa is a little
way beyond the town, on this side, under a cliff,
within a few paces of the sea, and thither the
drinkers go every morning in dishabille; but the
descent is by a great number of steps, which invalids
find very inconvenient. Betwixt the well
and the harbour, the bathing machines are ranged
along the beach, with all their proper utensils and
attendants—You have never seen one of these
machines—Image to yourself a small, snug,
wooden chamber, fixed upon a wheel-carriage,
having a door at each end and on each side a
little window above, a bench below—The bather,
ascending into this apartment by wooden steps,
shuts himself in, and begins to undress, while the
attendant yokes a horse to the end next the sea,
and draws the carriage forwards, till the surface
of the water is on a level with the floor of the 

dressing-room, then he moves and fixes the horse
to the other end—The person within being
stripped, opens the door to the sea-ward, where
he finds the guide ready, and plunges headlong
into the water—After having bathed, he re-ascends
into the apartment, by the steps which had
been shifted for that purpose, and puts on his
clothes at his leisure, while the carriage is drawn
back again upon the dry land; so that he has nothing
further to do, but to open the door, and
come down as he went up—Should he be so weak
or ill as to require a servant to put off and on his
clothes, there is room enough in the apartment
for half a dozen people. The guides who attend
the ladies in the water, are of their own sex, and
they and the female bathers have a dress of flannel
for the sea; nay, they are provided with other
conveniencies for the support of decorum. A certain
number of the machines are fitted with tilts,
that project from the sea-ward ends of them, so
as to screen the bathers from the view of all persons
whatsoever—The beach is admirably adapted
for this practice, the descent being gently gradual,
and the sand soft as velvet; but then the machines
can be used only at a certain time of the tide,
which varies every day; so that sometimes the
bathers are obliged to rise very early in the morning
—For my part, I love swimming as an exercise,
and can enjoy it at all times of the tide, without
the formality of an apparatus. —You and I
have often plunged together into the Isis; but the
sea is a much more noble bath, for health as well
as pleasure. You cannot conceive what a flow of
spirits it gives, and how it braces every sinew of
the human frame. Were I to enumerate half the
diseases which are every day cured by sea-bathing, 

you might justly say you had received a treatise,
instead of a letter, from 
your affectionate friend,
and servant,
J. Melford.
