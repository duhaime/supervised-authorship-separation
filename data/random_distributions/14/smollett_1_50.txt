Count Fathom unmasks his battery; is repulsed; 
and varies his operations without effect. 
Every necessary preparation being made,
Renaldo, accompanied by our adventurer,
took the road to Dover, where he embarked
in a packet-boat for Calais, after having
settled a correspondence with his dear
Ferdinand, from whom he did not part without
tears. He had before sollicited him to be
his fellow-traveller, that he might personally
enjoy the benefit of his conversation, and superior
sagacity; but these intreaties he strenuously
opposed, on pretence of his being determined
to push his fortune in England,
which he considered as his native country,
and as the land in which (of all others) a man
of merit has the best encouragement. Such
were the reasons he alledged, for refusing to 

attend his benefactor, who was himself eagerly
desirous of attaining a settlement in the
island of Great Britain: but our hero's real
motives for staying were of a very different
complexion. —The reader is already informed
of his aim upon the fair orphan, which, at
present, was the chief spring of his conduct:
he may also recollect such passages of his life,
as were sufficient to deter him from re-appearing
at Presburg or Vienna: but, besides these
reflections, he was detained by a full persuasion
that Renaldo would sink under the power and
influence of his antagonist, consequently be
rendered incapable to provide for his friends; 
and that he himself, fraught with wiles and
experience, as he was, could not fail to make
himself amends for what he had suffered among
a people equally rich and unthinking. 
Melvil having embraced our adventurer,
and with a deep sigh bid him take care of the
unfortunate Monimia, committed himself to the
sea, and, by the assistance of a favourable gale,
was, in four hours, safely landed on the
French shore; while Fathom took post-horses
for London, where he arrived that same night,
and next day, in the forenoon, went to visit
the beauteous mourner, who had as yet received
no intimation of Renaldo's departure
or design. He found her in the attitude of
writing a letter to her inconstant lover, the
contents of which the reader will be acquainted
with in due time. Her countenance, notwithstanding
the veil of melancholy by which
it was overcast, seemed altogether serene and
composed; she was the picture of pious resignation,
and sat like Patience on a monument, 

smiling at grief. After having paid the compliment
of the morning, Fathom begged pardon
for having omitted to visit her during three
days, in which, he said, his time had been
wholly engrossed in procuring a proper equipage
for Count Melvil, who had at last bid an
eternal adieu to the island of Great Britain. 
At this information the hapless Monimia fell
back in her chair, and continued some minutes
in a swoon; from which being recovered,
“Excuse me, Mr Fathom (cried she,
with a deep sigh); this, I hope, is the last agony
I shall feel from my unhappy passion.” 
—Then wiping the tears from her lovely eyes,
she retrieved her tranquillity, and desired to
know by what means Renaldo had been enabled
to undertake his journey into the empire. 
Our hero, upon this occasion, assumed the
whole merit of having promoted the interest
of his friend, by giving her to understand,
that he, in consequence of an unforeseen
windfall, had defrayed the expence of the
Count's equipment; though he observed, that
it was not without reluctance he saw Renaldo
make a wrong use of his friendship. 
“Although I was happy (proceeded this
artful traitor) in being able to discharge my
obligations to the house of Melvil, I could not
help feeling the most sensible chagrin, when I
saw my assistance rendered subservient to the
triumphs of the youth's baseness and infidelity; 
for he chose, as the companion of his
travels, the abandoned woman, for whom he
had forsaken the all-perfect Monimia, whose
virtue and accomplishments did not preserve
her sacred from his ungrateful sarcasms and 

unmannerly ridicule. Believe me, madam, I
was so shocked at his conversation on that subject,
and so much incensed at his want of delicacy,
that my temper was scarce sufficient for
the ceremony of parting; and now that my
debt to his family is overpaid, I have solemnly
renounced his correspondence.” 
When she heard that, instead of betraying
the least symptom of regret or compassion for
her unhappy fate, the perfidious youth had
exulted over her fall, and even made her a
subject for his mirth, the blood revisited her
faded cheeks, and resentment restored to her
eyes that poignancy which sorrow had before
overcome. Yet she scorn'd to give speech to
her indignation; but forcing a smile, “Why
should I repine,” said she, “at the mortifications
of a life which I despise, and from which,
I hope, Heaven will speedily set me free!” 
Fathom, fired by her emotion, which had
recalled all the graces of her beauty, exclaimed
in a rapture, “Talk not so contemptuously
of this life, which hath still a fund of happiness
in store for the amiable, the divine Monimia. 
Though one admirer hath proved an
apostate to his vows, your candour will not
suffer you to condemn the whole sex. Some
there are, whose bosoms glow with passion equally
pure, unalterable and intense. For
my own part, I have sacrificed to a rigid punctilio
of honour the dearest ideas of my heart. 
I beheld your unrivalled charms, and deeply
felt their power: yet, while a possibility of
Melvil's reformation remained, and while I
was restrained by my niggard fortune, from
making a tender worthy of your acceptance, 

I combated with my inclinations, and bore
without repining the pangs of hopeless love. 
But, now that my honour is disengaged, and
my fortune rendered independent, by the last
will of a worthy nobleman, whose friendship
I was favoured with in France, I presume to
lay myself at the feet of the adorable Monimia,
as the most faithful of admirers, whose
happiness or misery wholly depends upon her
nod. Believe me, Madam, these are not the
professions of idle gallantry—I speak the genuine,
though imperfect language of my
heart: words even the most pathetic cannot
do justice to my love. I gaze upon your
beauty with ravishment; but, I contemplate
the graces of your soul with such awful veneration,
that I tremble while I approach
you, as if my vows were addressed to some
superior being.” 
During this declaration, which was pronounced
in the most emphatic manner, Monimia
was successively agitated with shame,
anger and grief: nevertheless, she summoned her
whole philosophy to her aid, and with a tranquil,
though determined air, begged he would
not diminish the obligations he had already
conferred, by disturbing with such unseasonable
addresses, a poor unhappy maid, who had detached
all her thoughts from earthly objects,
and waited impatiently for that dissolution
which alone could put a period to her misfortunes. 
Fathom, imagining that these were no other
than the suggestions of a temporary disappointment
and despondence, which it was his business
to oppose with all his eloquence and art, renewed 

his theme with redoubled ardour, and
at last became so importunate in his desires,
that Monimia, provoked beyond the power of
concealing her resentment, said, she was heartily
sorry to find herself under the necessity of
telling him, that, in the midst of her misfortune,
she could not help remembering what she
had been. Then rising from her seat with all
the dignity of displeasure; “Perhaps,” added
she, “you have forgot who was the father of
the once-happy Monimia.” 
With these words she retired into another
chamber, leaving our adventurer confounded
by the repulse he had sustained. Not that he
was discouraged from prosecuting his aim:
on the contrary, this rebuff seemed to add fresh
vigour to his operations. He now thought it
high time to bring over Madam la Mer to his interest; 
and, to facilitate her conversion, took
an opportunity of bribing her with some inconsiderable
presents, after having amused her
with a plausible tale of his passion for Monimia,
with whom she undertook the office of his mediatrix,
on the supposition that his intentions
were honourable, and highly advantageous to
her lodger. 
She was,first of all, invested with the office
of obtaining pardon for the offence he had
given; and in this negotiation she succeeded
so well, as to become an advocate for his suit:
accordingly, she took all occasions of magnifying
his praise. His agreeable person was often
the subject of her discourse to the fair mourner:
her admiration dwelt upon his politeness,
good sense, and winning deportment: and she
every day retailed little stories of his benevolence and 

greatness of soul. The defect in his birth she
represented as a circumstance altogether foreign
from the consideration of his merit; especially
in a nation where such distinctions are as little
respected as they will be in a future state. She
mentioned several persons of note, who basked
in the sun-shine of power and fortune, without
having enjoyed the least hereditary assistance
from their fore fathers. One, she said, sprung
from the loins of an obscure attorney, another
was the grandson of a valet de chambre, a third
was the issue of an accomptant, and a fourth
the offspring of an woolen-draper: all these
were the children of their own good works,
and had raised themselves upon their personal
virtues and address; a foundation certainly
more solid and honourable, than a vague inheritance
derived from ancestors, in whose deserts
they could not be supposed to have bore
the least share. 
Monimia listened to all these arguments with
great patience and affability, though she at
once dived into the source from which all such
insinuations flowed; she joined in the commendations
of Fathom, and owned herself a
particular instance of that benevolence which
the old lady had so justly extolled; but, once
for all, to prevent the supplication which Madam
la Mer was about to make, she solemnly
protested, that her heart was altogether shut
against any other earthly engagement; and
that her thoughts were entirely employed
upon her eternal salvation. 
The assiduous landlady perceiving the steadiness
of her disposition, thought proper to alter
her method of proceeding, and, for the present, 

suspended that theme by which she found her
fair lodger disobliged. Resolved to reconcile
Monimia to life, before she would again recommend
Ferdinand to her love, she endeavoured
to amuse her imagination, by recounting the
occasional incidents of the day, hoping gradually
to decoy her attention to those sublunary objects
from which it had been industriously
weaned: she seasoned her conversation with
agreeable sallies; enlarged upon the different
scenes of pleasure and deversion appertaining
to this great metropolis: practised upon her
palate, with the delicacies of eating; endeavoured
to shake her temperance with repeated
proffers and recommendations of certain cordials
and restoratives which she alledged were
necessary for the recovery of her health; and
pressed her to make little excursions into the
fields that skirt the town, for the benefit of air
and exercise. 
While this auxiliary plied the disconsolate
Monimia on one hand, Fathom was not remiss
on the other; he now seemed to have sacrificed
his passion to her quiet; his discourse turned
upon more indifferent subjects; he endeavoured
to dispel her melancholy with arguments
drawn from philosophy and religion: on some
occasions, he displayed all his fund of good
humour, with a view to beguile her sorrow; 
he importuned her to give him the pleasure of
'squiring her to some place of innocent entertainment; 
and finally, insisted upon her accepting
a pecuniary reinforcement to her finances,
which he knew to be in a most consumptive
condition.
