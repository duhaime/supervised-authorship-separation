For my Part, I knew it in vain to expect
Leave to go to Church now, and so I did
not ask; and I was the more indifferent, because,
if I might have had Permission, the Sight
of the neighbouring Gentry, who had despis'd
my Sufferings, would have given me great Regret
and Sorrow; and it was impossible I should
have edify'd under any Doctrine preach'd by
Mr. Peters: So I apply'd myself to my private
Devotions. 
Mr. Williams came Yesterday, and this Day,
as usual, and took my Letter; but having no
good Opportunity, we avoided one another's
Conversation, and kept at a Distance: But I
was concern'd I had not the Key; for I would
not have lost a Moment in that Case, had I
been he, and he I. When I was at my Devotions,
Mrs. Jewkes came up, and wanted me
sadly to sing her a Psalm, as she had often on
common Days importun'd me for a Song upon
the Spinnet; but I declin'd it, because my Spirits
were so low I could hardly speak, nor car'd to 

be spoken to; but when she was gone, I,
remembering the cxxxviith Psalm to be a little
touching, turn'd to it, and took the Liberty
to alter it somewhat nearer to my Case. 
I hope I did not sin in it; but thus I turn'd
it: 


I.
When sad I sat in B&sblank;&sblank;&sblank;n-hall,
 All guarded round about,
And thought of ev'ry absent Friend,
 The Tears for Grief burst out.


II.
My Joys and Hopes all overthrown,
 My Heart-strings almost broke,
Unfit my Mind for Melody,
 Much more to bear a Joke;


III.
Then she to whom I Pris'ner was,
 Said to me tauntingly,
Now chear your Heart, and sing a Song,
 And tune your Mind to Joy.


IV.
Alas! said I, how can I frame
 My heavy Heart to sing,
Or tune my Mind, while thus enthrall'd
 By such a wicked Thing!



V.
But yet, if from my Innocence
 I, ev'n in Thought should slide,
Then let my Fingers quite forget
 The sweet Spinnet to guide.


VI.
And let my Tongue within my Mouth
 Be lock'd for ever fast,
If I rejoice, before I see
 My full Deliv'rance past.


VII.
And thou, Almighty, recompense
 The Evils I endure,
From those who seek my sad Disgrace,
 So causeless, to procure.


VIII.
Remember, Lord, this Mrs. Jewkes,
 When with a mighty Sound,
She cries, Down with her Chastity,
 Down to the very Ground!


IX.
Ev'n so shalt thou, O wicked One,
 At length to Shame be brought;
And happy shall all those be call'd,
 That my Deliv'rance wrought.



X.
Yea, blessed shall the Man be call'd
 That shames thee of thy Evil;
And saves me from thy vile Attempts,
 And thee, too, from the D&sblank;&sblank;&sblank;&sblank;l.
