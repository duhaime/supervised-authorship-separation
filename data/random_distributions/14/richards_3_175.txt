My dearest Pamela,
I Understand Things go not so well as I wish. If
you think my coming up to Town, and residing
with you, while you stay in it, will be of Service 

to you, or help to get you out of it, I will
set out directly. I will pretend some Indisposition,
and a Desire of consulting your London Physicians; 
or any thing you shall think fit to be done, by 
Your affectionate Sister,
and faithful Friend,
B. Davers.
