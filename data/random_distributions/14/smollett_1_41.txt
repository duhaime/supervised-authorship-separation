Our adventurer is made acquainted with a new
scene of life. 
Just as he entered these mansions of misery,
his ears were invaded with an hoarse
and dreadful voice, exclaiming, “You, Bess
Beetle, score a couple of fresh eggs, a penny-worth
of butter, and half a pint of mountain
to the king; and stop credit till the bill is paid; 
he is now debtor for fifteen shillings and sixpence,
and damn me if I trust him one farthing
more, if he was the best king in Christendom:
and d'ye hear, send ragged head with
five pounds of potatoes for major Macleaver's
supper, and let him have what drink he wants; 
the fat widow gentlewoman from Pimlico has
promised to quit his score. Sir Mungo Barebones
may have some hasty pudding and small
beer, though I don't expect to see his coin, no
more than to receive the eighteen pence I laid
out for a pair of breeches to his backside. 
What then? he's a quiet sort of a body, and a
great scholar, and it was a scandal to the place,
to see him going about in that naked condition:
as for the mad Frenchman with the
beard, if you give him so much as a cheeseparing,
you b&wblank;ch, I'll send you back to the
hole, among your old companions; an impudent
dog! I'll teach him to draw his sword
upon the governor of an English county goal. 
What! I suppose he thought he had to do
with a French hang-tang dang, rabbit him! he
shall eat his white feather before I give him
credit for a morsel of bread.” 

Although our adventurer was very little disposed,
at this juncture, to make observations
foreign to his own affairs, he could not help
taking notice of these extraordinary injunctions; 
especially those concerning the person
who was intitled King, whom, however, he supposed
to be some prisoner elected as the magistrate
by the joint suffrage of his fellows. 
Having taken possession of his chamber, which
he rented at five shillings a week, and being ill
at ease in his own thoughts, he forthwith secured
his door, undressed and went to bed, in
which, though it was none of the most elegant
or inviting couches, he enjoyed profound repose
after the accumulated fatigues and mortifications
of the day. Next morning after breakfast,
the keeper entered his apartment, and
gave him to understand, that the gentlemen
under his care, having heard of the count's arrival,
had deputed one of their number to wait
upon him with the compliments of condolance,
suitable to the occasion, and invite him to become
a member of their society. Our hero
could not politely dispence with this instance of
civility, and their ambassador being instantly
introduced by the name of captain Minikin,
saluted him with great solemnity. 
This was a person equally remarkable for
his extraordinary figure and address; his age
seemed to border upon forty, his stature amounted
to five feet, his visage was long, meagre
and weather beaten, and his aspect, though
not quite rueful, exhibited a certain formality,
which was the result of care and conscious importance. 
He was very little encumbred with
flesh and blood; yet, what body he had, was 

well proportioned, his limbs were elegantly
turned, and by his carriage he was well intitled
to that compliment which we pay to any person,
when we say he has very much the air of a
gentleman. There was also an evident singularity
in his dress, which tho' intended as an
improvement, appeared to be an extravagant
exaggeration of the mode, and at once evinced
him an original to the discerning eyes of our
adventurer, who received him with his usual
complaisance, and made a very eloquent acknowledgment
of the honour and satisfaction
he received from the visit of the representative,
and the hospitality of his constituents. The
captain's peculiarities were not confined to his
external appearance; for his voice resembled
the sound of a bassoon, or the aggregate hum
of a whole bee-hive, and his discourse was almost
nothing else than a series of quotations
from the English poets, interlarded with French
phrases, which he retained for their significance,
on the recommendation of his friends, being
himself unacquainted with that or any other
outlandish tongue. 
Fathom finding this gentleman of a very
communicative disposition, thought he could
not have a fairer opportunity of learning the
history of his fellow-prisoners; and turning the
conversation on that subject, was not disappointed
in his expectation. “I don't doubt , Sir,” 
said he, with the utmost solemnity of declamation,
“but you look with horror upon every
object that surrounds you in this uncomfortable
place; but nevertheless here are some, who,
as my friend Shakespear has it, have seen better
days, and have with holy bell been knolled to 

church; and sat at good men's feasts, and wiped
their eyes of drops that sacred pity hath engendered. 
You must know, Sir, that exclusive of
the Canaille, or the profanum Vulgus, as they
are stiled by Horace, there are several small
communities in the goal,consisting of people
who are attracted by the manners and dispositions
of each other: for this place, Sir, is
quite a microcosm and as the great world, so is
this a Stage, and all the men and women merely
players. For my own part, Sir, I have always
made it a maxim to associate with the best company
I can find: not that I pretend to boast of
my family or extraction; because you know,
as the poet says, Vix ea nostra voco. My father,
'tis true, was a man that piqued himself
upon his pedigree as well as upon his politesse
and personal merit; for he had been a very
old officer in the army, and I myself may say,
I was born with a spontoon in my hand. Sir, I
have had the honour to serve his majesty these
twenty years, and have been bandied about in
the course of duty, through all the British plantations,
and you see the recompence of all my
service. But this is a disagreeable subject, and
therefore I shall wave it: however, as Butler
observes, 
“My only comfort is, that now,
My dubbolt fortune is so low,
That either it must quickly end,
Or turn about again and mend.”
And now to return from this digression, you
will perhaps be surprized to hear that the head
or chairman of our club is really a sovereign
prince. No less I'll assure you than the celebrated 

Theodore king of Corsica, who lies in
prison for a debt of a few hundred pounds. 
Heu! quantum mutatus ab illo. It is not my
business to censure the conduct of my superiors:
but I always speak my mind in a cavalier
manner, and as, according to the Spectator,
talking to a friend is no more than thinking
aloud, entre nous, his Corsican majesty has been
scurvily treated by a certain administration:
be that as it will, he is a personage of a very
portly appearance, and is quite master of the
beinseance. Besides, they will find it their interest
to have recourse again to his alliance:
and in that case, some of us may expect to
profit by his restoration: but few words are
best. 
He that maintains the second rank in our assembly,
is one major Macleaver, an Irish gentleman,
who has served abroad: a soldier of
fortune, Sir, a man of unquestionable honour
and courage; but a little over-bearing, in consequence
of his knowledge and experience. 
He is a person of a good address to be sure,
and quite free of the mauvaise honte; and he
may have seen a good deal of service; but
what then? other people may be as good as he,
though they have not had such opportunities:
if he speaks five or six languages, he does not
pretend to any taste in the liberal arts, which
are the criterion of an accomplished gentleman. 
The next is Sir Mungo Barebones, the representative
of a very ancient family in the North; 
his affairs are very much derangeé, but he is a
gentleman of great probity and learning, and
at present engag'd in a very grand scheme,
which, if he can bring it to bear, will render 

him famous to all posterity: no less than the
conversion of the Jews and the Gentiles. The
project, I own, looks chimerical to one who
has not conversed with the author; but, in my
opinion, he has clearly demonstrated from an
anagrammatical analysis of a certain Hebrew
word, that his present majesty, whom God preserve,
is the person pointed at in scripture, as
the temporal Messiah of the Jews; and if he
could once raise by subscription, such a trifling
sum as twelve hundred thousand pounds, I
make no doubt but he would accomplish his
aim, vast and romantic as it seems to be. 
Besides these, we have another messmate,
who is a French chevalier, an odd sort of a man,
a kind of Lazarillo de Tormes, a Caricatura; 
he wears a long beard, pretends to be a great
poet, and makes a damned Fracas with his
verses. The king has been obliged to exert his
authority over him more than once, by ordering
him into close confinement, for which he
was so rash as to send his majesty a challenge; 
but he afterwards made his submission, and was
again taken into favour: the truth is, I believe
his brain is a little disordered, and he
being a stranger we overlook his extravagancies. 
Sir, we shall think ourselves happy in your
accession to our society: you will be under no
sort of restraint: for though we dine at one
table, every individual calls and pays for his
own mess. Our conversation, such as it is,
will not, I hope, be disagreeable; and though
we have not opportunities of breathing the
pure Arcadian air, and cannot “under the
shade of melancholy boughs, lose and neglect
the creeping hours of time;” we may enjoy 

ourselves over a glass of punch or a dish of tea:
nor are we destitute of friends who visit us in
these shades of distress. The major has a numerous
acquaintance of both sexes, among others,
a first cousin of good fortune, who with
her daughters often chear our solitude; she is
a very sensible lady-like gentlewoman, and the
young ladies have a certain degageé air, that
plainly shews they have seen the best company:
besides, I will venture to recommend Mrs Minikin,
as a woman of tolerable breeding and
capacity, who, I hope, will not be found altogether
deficient in the accomplishments of the
sex. So that we find means to make little parties,
in which the time glides away insensibly. 
Then I have a small collection of books, which
are at your service. You may amuse yourself
with Shakespear, or Milton, or Don Quixote,
or any of our modern authors that are worth
reading, such as the adventures of Loveill,
Lady Frail, George Edwards, Joe Thompson,
Bampfylde More Carew, Young Scarron, and
Miss Betsy Thoughtless; and if you have a
taste for drawing, I can entertain you with a
parcel of prints by the best masters.” 
A man of our hero's politeness, could not
help expressing himself in the warmest terms of
gratitude for this courteous declaration. He
thanked the captain in particular for his obliging
offers, and begged he would be so good as
to present his respects to the society of which
he longed to be a member. It was determined
therefore, that Minikin should return in an
hour, when the count would be dressed, in order
to conduct him into the presence of his
majesty; and he had already taken his leave for 

the present, when all of a sudden he came back,
and taking hold of a waistcoat that lay upon a
chair, “Sir,” said he, “give me leave to look
at that fringe; I think it is the most elegant
knitting I ever saw: but pray, Sir, are not these
quite out of fashion: I thought plain silk, such
as this that I wear, had been the mode; with
the pockets very low.” Before Fathom had
time to make any sort of reply, he took notice
of his hat and pumps; the first of which he
said was too narrow in the brims, and the last
an inch too low in the heels; indeed they formed
a remarkable contrast with his own; for,
exclusive of the fashion of the cock, which resembled
the form of a Roman galley, the brim
of his hat, if properly spread, would have projected
a shade sufficient to shelter a whole file of
musqueteers from the heat of a summer's sun; 
and the heels of his shoes were so high as to
raise his feet three inches at least, from the
surface of the earth. 
Having made these observations for the credit
of his taste, he retired, and returning at the
time appointed, accompanied Ferdinand to the
apartment of the King, at the door of which,
their ears were invaded with a strange sound,
being that of an human voice imitating the
noise of a drum. The captain hearing this
alarm, made a full stop, and giving the count
to understand that his majesty was busy, begged
he would not take it amiss, if the introduction
should be delayed for a few moments. 
Fathom curious to know the meaning of what
he had heard, applied to his guide for information,
and learned that the king and the major,
whom he had nominated to the post of his 

general in chief, were employed in landing
troops upon the Genoese territory: that is,
that they were settling before-hand the manner
of their disembarkation. 
He then, by the direction of his conductor,
reconnoitred them through the key hole, and
perceived the sovereign and his minister sitting
on opposite sides of a deal board table covered
with a large chart or map, upon wich he saw
a great number of muscle and oister shells,
ranged in a certain order, and at a little distance,
several regular squares and columns
made of cards cut in small pieces. The prince
himself, whose eyes were reinforced by spectacles,
surveyed this armament with great attention; 
while the general put the whole in action,
and conducted their motions by beat of drum. 
The muscle-shells, according to Minikin's
explanation, represented the transports, the
oyster-shells were considered as the men of war
that covered the troops in landing, and the
pieces of card exhibited the different bodies
into which the army was formed upon its disembarkation. 
As an affair of such consequence could not
be transacted without opposition, they had
provided divers ambuscades, consisting of the
enemy, whom they represented by grey pease; 
and accordingly, general Macleaver perceiving
the said grey pease marching along shore, to attack
his forces before they could be drawn up
in battalia, thus addressed himself to the oyster-shells
in an audible voice: “You men of war,
don't you see the front of the enemy advancing,
and the rest of the detachment following out
of sight? Arrah! the Devil burn you, why 

don't you come ashore and open your batteries?” 
So saying, he pushed the shells towards
the breach, performed the cannonading with
his voice, the grey pease were soon put in confusion,
the general was beat, the cards marched
forwards in order of battle, and the enemy
having retreated with great precipitation, they
took possession of their ground without farther
difficulty.
