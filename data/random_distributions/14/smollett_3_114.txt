Pickle seems tolerably well reconciled to his cage; 
and is by the clergyman entertained with the memoirs
of a noted personage, whom he sees by accident
in the Fleet.
The knight had scarce finished this narrative,
when our hero was told, that a gentleman
in the coffee-room wanted to see him; 
and when he went thither, he found his friend
Crabtree, who had transacted all his affairs, according
to the determination of the preceding
day; and now gave him an account of the remarks
he had over-heard on the subject of his
misfortune: for the manner of the arrest was so
public and extraordinary, that those who were
present, immediately propagated it among their
acquaintance; and it was that same evening discoursed
upon at several tea and card-tables, with 

this variation from the truth, that the debt amounted
to twelve thousand, instead of twelve
hundred pounds: from which circumstance it was
conjectured, that Peregrine was a bite from the
beginning, who had found credit on account of
his effrontery and appearance, and imposed himself
upon the town as a young gentleman of fortune. 
They rejoiced, therefore, at his calamity,
which they considered as a just punishment for
his fraud and presumption, and began to review
certain particulars of his conduct, that plainly
demonstrated him to be a rank adventurer, long
before he had arrived at this end of his career. 
Pickle, who now believed his glory was set
for ever, received this intelligence with that disdain
which enables a man to detach himself effectually
from the world, and, with great tranquillity,
gave the Misanthrope an entertaining
detail of what he had seen and heard since their
last parting. While they amused themselves in
this manner over a dish of coffee, they were
joined by the parson, who congratulated our hero
upon his bearing mischance with such philosophic
quiet, and began to regale the two friends with
some curious circumstances relating to the private
history of the several prisoners, as they happened
to come in. 
At length a gentleman entered, at sight of
whom the clergyman rose up, and saluted him
with a most reverential bow, which was graciously
returned by the stranger, who, with a
young man that attended him, retired, to the other
end of the room. They were no sooner out of
hearing, than the communicative priest desired
his company to take particular notice of this person
to whom he had paid his respects: “That 

man (said he) is this day one of the most flagrant
instances of neglected virtue which the world
can produce. Over and above a cool, discerning
head, fraught with uncommon learning and experience,
he is possessed of such fortitude and resolution,
as no difficulties can discourage, and
no danger impair; and so indefatigable is his humanity,
that even now, while he is surrounded
with such embarassments, as would distract the
brain of any ordinary mortal, he has added considerably
to his incumbrances, by taking under
his protection that young gentleman, who, induced
by his character, appealed to his benevolence
for redress of the grievances under which
he labours from the villainy of his guardian.” 
Peregrine's curiosity being excited by this encomium,
he asked the name of this generous patron,
of which when he was informed, “I am
no stranger (said he) to the fame of that gentleman,
who has made a considerable noise in the
world, on account of that great cause he undertook
in defence of an unhappy orphan; and since
he is a person of such an amiable disposition, I
am heartily sorry to find that his endeavours have
not met with that successful issue which their
good fortune in the beginning seemed to promise. 
Indeed, the circumstance of his espousing
that cause was so uncommon and romantic, and
the depravity of the human heart so universal,
that some people, unacquainted with his real character,
imagined his views were altogether selfish; 
and some were not wanting, who affirmed he
was a mere adventurer. Nevertheless, I must
do him the justice to own, I have heard some of
the most virulent of those who were concerned 

on the other side of the question, bear testimony
in his favour, observing, that he was deceived into
the expence of the whole, by the plausible
story which at first engaged his compassion. Your
description of his character confirms me in the
same opinion; though I am quite ignorant of the
affair, the particulars of which I should be glad
to learn, as well as a genuine account of his
own life, many circumstances of which are by
his enemies, I believe, egregiously misrepresented.” 
“Sir, (answered the priest) that is a piece of
satisfaction which I am glad to find myself capable
of giving you: I have had the pleasure of
being acquainted with Mr. M&wblank; from his
youth, and every thing which I shall relate concerning
him, you may depend upon as a fact
which hath fallen under my own cognizance,
or been vouched upon the credit of undoubted
evidence. 
Mr. M&wblank;'s father was a minister of the established
church of Scotland, descended from a
very ancient clan, and his mother nearly related
to a noble family in the northern part of that
kingdom. While the son was boarded at a public
school, where he made good progress in the
Latin tongue, his father died, and he was left an
orphan to the care of an uncle, who, finding
him determined against any servile employment,
kept him at school, that he might prepare himself
for the university, with a view of being qualified
for his father's profession. 
Here his imagination was so heated by the warlike
atchievements he found recorded in the Latin
authors, such as Cæsar, Curtius and Buchanan, 

that he was seized with an irresistible thirst of
military glory, and desire of trying his fortune
in the army; and his majesty's troops taking
the field, in consequence of the rebellion which
happened in the year seventeen hundred and
fifteen, this young adventurer, thinking no life
equal to that of a soldier, found means to furnish
himself with a fusil and bayonet, and
leaving the school, repaired to the camp near
Stirling, with a view of signalizing himself in
the field, though he was at that time but just
turned of thirteen. He offered his service to several
officers, in hope of being inlisted in their
companies; but they would not receive him, because
they rightly concluded that he was some
school-boy broke loose, without the knowledge or
consent of his relations. Notwithstanding this
discouragement, he continued in camp, curiously
prying into every part of the service; and such
was the resolution conspicuous in him, even at
such a tender age, that after his small finances
were exhausted, he persisted in his design; and,
because he would not make his wants known,
actually subsisted for several days on hips, haws
and sloes, and other spontaneous fruits which
he gathered in the woods and fields. Mean
while, he never failed to be present, when any
regiment, or corps of men, were drawn out to
be exercised and reviewed, and accompanied them
in all their evolutions, which he had learned to
great perfection, by observing the companies
which were quartered in the place where he was
at school. This eagerness and perseverance attracted
the notice of many officers, who after having
commended his spirit and zeal, pressed him to return
to his parents, and even threatened to expel 

him from the camp, if he would not comply with
their advice. 
These remonstrances having no other effect
than that of warning him to avoid his monitors,
they thought proper to alter their behaviour towards
him, took him into their protection, and
even into their mess; and what above all other
marks of favour, pleased the young soldier most,
permitted him to incorporate in the battalion,
and take his turn of duty with the other men. In
this happy situation he was discovered by a relation
of his mother, who was a captain in the army,
and who used all his authority and influence
in persuading M&wblank; to return to school, but
finding him deaf to his admonitions and threats,
he took him under his own care, and when the
army marched to Dumblane, left him at Stirling,
with express injunction to keep himself within
the walls. 
He temporized with his kinsman, fearing that
should he seem refractory, the captain would
have ordered him to be shut up in the castle; and
inflamed with the desire of seeing a battle, no
sooner saw his relation marched off the ground,
than he mixed in with another regiment, to
which his former patrons belonged, and proceeded
to the field, where he distinguished himself,
even at that early time of life, by his gallantry,
in helping to retrieve a pair of colours belonging
to M&wblank;n's regiment; so that after the
affair, he was presented to the duke of Argyle,
and recommended strongly to brigadier Grant,
who invited him into his regiment, and promised
to provide for him with the first opportunity: 
But that gentleman in a little time lost his command
upon the duke's disgrace, and the regiment 

was ordered for Ireland, being given to colonel
Nassau, whose favour, the young volunteer acquired
to such a degree, that he was recommended
to the king for an ensigncy, which in all probability
he would have obtained, had not the regiment
been unluckily reduced. 
In consequence of this reduction, which happened
in the most severe season of the year, he was
obliged to return to his own country, thro' infinite
hardships, to which he was exposed from the
narrowness of his circumstances; and continuing
still enamoured of a military life, he entered into
the regiment of Scotch greys, at that time commanded
by the late Sir James Campbell, who being
acquainted with his family and character, encouraged
him with the promise of speedy preferment. 
In this corps he remained three years,
during which, he had no opportunity of seeing
actual service, except at the affair of Glensheel; 
and this life of insipid quiet, must have hung heavy
upon a youth of M&wblank;'s active disposition, had
not he found exercise for the mind, in'reading
books of amusement, history, voyages, and geography,
together with those that treated of the
art of war ancient and modern, for which
he contracted such an eager appetite, that he
used to spend sixteen hours a day in this employment. 
About that time, he became acquainted
with a gentleman of learning and taste,
who observing his indefatigable application, and
insatiable thirst after knowledge, took upon
himself the charge of superintending his studies; 
and by the direction of such an able guide,
the young soldier converted his attention to a
more solid and profitable course of reading. So
inordinate was his desire of making speedy advances 

in the paths of learning, that within the compass
of three months, he diligently perused the
writings of Lock, and Malbranche, and made
himself master of the first six, and of the eleventh
and twelfth books of Euclid's elements. 
He considered Puffendorf and Grotius with uncommon
care, acquired a tolerable degree of
knowledge in the French language, and his imagination
was so captivated with the desire of
learning, that seeing no prospect of a war, or
views of being provided for in the service, he
quitted the army, and went through a regular
course of university education. Having made
such progress in his studies, he resolved to qualify
himself for the church, and acquired such a stock
of school divinity under the instructions of a learned
professor at Edinburgh, that he more than
once mounted the rostrum, in the public hall,
and held forth with uncommon applause: But
being discouraged from a prosecution of his plan,
by the unreasonable austerity of some of the
Scotch clergy, by whom, the most indifferent
and innocent words and actions, were often
misconstrued into levity and misconduct; he
resolved to embrace the first favourable opportunity
of going abroad, being enflamed with the
desire of seeing foreign countries, and actually set
out for Holland, where for the space of two years,
he studied the Roman law, with the law of nature
and nations, under the famous professors
Tolieu and Barbyrac. 
Having thus finished his school education, he
set out for Paris, with a view to make himself
perfect in the French language, and learn such
useful exercises, as might be acquired with the
wretched remnant of his slender estate, which 

was by that time reduced very low. In his
journey through the Netherlands, he went to Namure,
and paid his respects to bishop Strickland
and general Collier, by whom we was received
with great civility, in consequence of letters of
recommendation, with which he was provided
from the Hague, and the old general assured him
of his protection and interest for a pair of colours,
if he was disposed to enter into the Dutch Service. 
Tho' he was by that time, pretty well cured
of his military Don Quixotism, he would not totally
decline the generous proffer, for which he
thanked him in the most grateful terms, telling
the general that he would pay his duty to him on
his return from France, and then, if he could
determine upon returning to the army, should
think himself highly honoured in being under his
command. 
After a stay of two months in Flanders, he
proceeded to Paris, and far from taking up his
habitation in the suburbs of St. Germain, according
to the custom of English travellers, he
hired a private lodging on the other side of the
river, and associated chiefly with French officers,
who (their youthful sallies being over) are allowed
to be the politest gentlemen of that kingdom. 
In this scheme he found his account so much,
that he could not but wonder at the folly of his
countrymen, who lose the main scope of their
going abroad, by spending their time and fortune
idly with one another. 
During his residence in Holland, he had made
himself acquainted with the best authors in the
French language, so that he was able to share in
their conversation; a circumstance from which he
found great benefit; for, it not only improved 

him in his knowledge of that tongue, but also
tended to the enlargement of his acquaintance, in
the course of which, he contracted intimacies in
some families of good fashion, especially those of
the long robe, which would have enabled him to
pass his time very agreeably, had he been a little
easier in point of fortune: but his finances, notwithstanding
the most rigid oeconomy, being, in
a few months, reduced to a very low ebb, the
prospect of indigence threw a damp upon all his
pleasures, tho' he never suffered himself to be
thereby, in any degree, dispirited; being in that
respect, of so happy a disposition, that conscious
poverty or abundance made very slight impressions
upon his mind. 
This consumption of his cash, however, involved
him in some perplexity; and he deliberated
with himself whether he should return to
general Collier, or repair to London, where he
might possibly fall into some business not unbecoming
a gentleman; tho' he was very much
mortified to find himself incapable of gratifying
an inordinate desire which possessed him of making
the grand tour, or at least, of visiting the
southern parts of France. 
While he thus hesitated between different suggestions,
he was one morning, visited by a gentleman
who had sought and cultivated his friendship,
and for whom he had done a good office, in
supporting him with spirit, against a brutal German,
with whom he had an affair of honour. 
This gentleman came to propose a party for a
fortnight, to Fontainbleau, where the court then
was; and the proposal being declined by M&wblank; 
with more than usual stiffness, his friend was very
urgent to know the reason of his refusal, and 

at length, with some confusion, said, “Perhaps
your finances are low.” M&wblank; replied, that
he had wherewithal to defray the expence of his
journey to London, where he could be furnished
with a fresh supply; and this answer was no sooner
made, than the other taking him by the hand,
“My dear friend, (said he) I am not unacquainted
with your affairs, and would have offered you
my credit long ago, if I had thought it would be
acceptable; even now, I do not pretend to give
you money, but desire and insist upon it, that
you will accept of the loan of these two pieces of
paper, to be repayed when you marry a woman
with a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, or
obtain an employment of a thousand a year.” 
So saying he presented him with two actions of
above two thousand livres each. 
M&wblank; was astonished at this unexpected
instance of generosity in a stranger, and with
suitable acknowledgment, peremptorily refused
to incur such an obligation; but at length, he
was, by dint of importunity, and warm expostulation
prevailed upon to accept one of the actions,
on condition that the gentleman would take his
note for the sum; and this he absolutely rejected,
until M&wblank; promised to draw upon him for
double the value, or more, in case he should at
any time want a further supply. This uncommon
act of friendship and generosity, M&wblank; afterwards
had an opportunity to repay ten-fold,
tho' he could not help regretting the occasion, on
his friend's account. That worthy man having,
by placing too much confidence in a villanous
lawyer, and a chain of other misfortunes, involved
himself and his amiable lady in a labyrinth
of difficulties, which threatened the total ruin of 

his family; M&wblank; felt the inexpressible satisfaction
of delivering his benefactor from the snare. 
Being thus reinforced by the generosity of his
friend, M&wblank; resolved to execute his former
plan of seeing the south of France, together with
the seaports of Spain, as far as Cadiz, from
whence he proposed to take a passage for London
by sea, and with this view, sent forwards his
trunks by the diligence to Lyons, determined to
ride post, in order to enjoy a better view of the
country, and for the conveniency of stopping at
those places where there was any thing remarkable
to be seen or enquired into. While he was
employed in taking leave of his Parisian friends,
who furnished him with abundant recommendation,
a gentleman of his own country, who spoke
little or no French, hearing of his intention, begged
the favour of accompanying him in his expedition. 
With this new companion, therefore, he set
out for Lyons, where he was perfectly well
received by the intendant and some of the
best families of the place, in consequence of
his letters of recommendation; and after a
short stay in that city, proceeded down the
Rhone, to Avignon, in what is called the coche
d'eau; then visiting the principal towns of
Dauphiné, Languedoc and Provence, he returned
to the delightful city of Marseilles, where he
and his fellow traveller were so much captivated
by the serenity of the air, the good nature and
hospitality of the sprightly inhabitants, that they
never dreamed of changing their quarters, during
the whole winter, and part of the spring: Here
he acquired the acquaintance of the marquis 

D'Argens, attorney-general in the parliament of
Aix, and of his eldest son, who now makes so
great a figure in the literary world; and when the
affair of father Girard and madamoiselle Cadiere
began to make a noise, he accompanied these two
gentlemen to Toulon, where the marquis was
ordered to take precognition of the facts. 
On his return to Marseilles, he found a
certain noble lord of great fortune, under the
direction of a Swiss governor, who had accommodated
him with two of his own relations,
of the same country, by way of companions,
together with five servants in his train. They
being absolute strangers in the place, M&wblank; 
introduced them to the intendant, and several
other good families; and had the good fortune to
be so agreeable to his lordship, that he proposed,
and even pressed him to live with him in England,
as a friend and companion; and to take upon him
the superintendance of his affairs, in which case,
he would settle upon him four hundred a year for
life. 
This proposal was too advantageous to be
slighted by a person of no fortune, or fixed establishment; 
he, therefore, made no difficulty of
closing with it: but as his lordship's departure
was fixed to a short day, and he urged him to
accompany him to Paris, and from thence to
England, M&wblank; thought it would be improper
and indecent to interfere with the office of his
governor, who might take umbrage at his favour,
and therefore excused himself from a compliance
with his lordship's request, until his minority
should be expired, as he was within a few months
of being of age. However, he repeated his importunities
so earnestly, and the governor joined 

in the request, with such appearance of cordiality,
that he was prevailed upon to comply with their
joint desire; and, in a few days, set out with
them for Paris, by the way of Lyons. But before
they had been three days in this city, M&wblank; 
perceived a total change in the behaviour of the
Swiss and his two relations, who, in all probability,
became jealous of his influence with his
lordship; and he no sooner made this discovery,
than he resolved to withdraw himself from such a
disagreeable participation of that young nobleman's
favour. He therefore, in spite of all his
lordship's intreaties and remonstrances, quitted
him for the present; alledging, as a pretext, that
he had a longing desire to see Switzerland and
the banks of the Rhine, and promising to meet
him again in England. 
This his intention being made known to the
governor and his friends, their countenances immediately
cleared up, their courtesy and complaisance
returned, and they even furnished him
with letters for Geneva, Lausane, Bern, and
Soleures; in consequence of which, he met with
unusual civilities at these places. Having made
this tour with his Scotch friend, (who came up
to him before he left Lyons) and visited the most
considerable towns on both sides of the Rhine,
and the courts of the Electors Palatine, Mentz,
and Cologn, he arrived in Holland; and from
thence, thro' the Netherlands, repaired to London,
where he found my lord just returned from
Paris. 
His lordship received him with expressions of
uncommon joy, would not suffer him to stir from
him for several days, and introduced him to his
relations. 

M&wblank; accompanied his lordship from London
to his country-seat, where he was indeed treated
with great friendship and confidence, and consulted
in every thing; but the noble peer never
once made mention of the annuity which he had
promised to settle upon him; nor did M&wblank; remind
him of it, because he conceived it was his
affair to fulfil his engagements of his own accord. 
W&wblank; being tired of the manner of living
at this place, made an excursion to Bath,
where he staid about a fortnight, to partake of
the diversions; and, upon his return, found his
lordship making dispositions for another journey
to Paris. 
Surprised at this sudden resolution, he endeavoured
to dissuade him from it; but his remonstrances
were rendered ineffectual by the insinuations
of a foreigner, who had come over with him,
and filled his imagination with extravagant notions
of pleasure, infinitely superior to any which he
could enjoy while he was in the trammels, and
under the restraints of a governor. He, therefore,
turned a deaf ear to all M&wblank;'s arguments,
and intreated him to accompany him in the
journey: but this gentleman, foreseeing that a
young man, like my lord, of strong passions,
and easy to be misled, would, in all probability,
squander away great sums of money, in a way
that would neither do credit to himself, or to
those who were concerned with him, resisted all
his solicitations, on pretence of having business of
consequence at London; and afterwards had reason
to be extremely well pleased with his own
conduct in this particular. 
Before he set out on this expedition, M&wblank;, in
justice to himself, reminded him of the proposal 

which he had made to him at Marseilles, desiring
to know if he had altered his design in that particular; 
in which case, he would turn his thoughts
some other way; as he would not in the least be
thought to intrude or pin himself upon any man. 
My lord protested, in the most solemn manner,
that he still continued in his former resolution; 
and again beseeching him to bear him
company into France, promised that every thing
should be settled to his satisfaction, upon their
return to England. M&wblank;, however, still persisted
in his refusal, for the abovementioned reasons:
and tho' he never heard more of the annuity,
he nevertheless continued to serve his lordship
with his advice and good offices ever after; particularly
in directing his choice to an alliance with
a lady of eminent virtue, the daughter of a noble
lord, more conspicuous for his shining parts than
the splendor of his titles, (a circumstance upon
which he always reflected with particular satisfaction,
as well on account of the extraordinary
merit of the lady, as because it vested in her
children a considerable part of that great estate,
which, of right, belonged to her grandmother)
and afterwards put him in a way to retrieve
his estate from a heavy load of debt he had contracted. 
When my lord set out on his Paris expedition,
the money M&wblank; had received from his
generous friend at Paris was almost reduced to the
last guinea. He had not yet reaped the least
benefit from his engagements with his lordship; 
and disdaining to ask for a supply from him, he
knew not how to subsist, with any degree of
credit, 'till his return. 
This uncomfortable prospect was the more
disagreeable to him, as, at that time of life, he 

was much inclined to appear in the gay world,
had contracted a taste for plays, opera's, and other
public diversions, and acquired an acquaintance
with many people of good fashion, which could
not be maintained without a considerable expence. 
In this emergency, he thought he could not employ
his idle time more profitably than in translating,
from foreign languages, such books as were
then chiefly in vogue; and upon application to a
friend, who was a man of letters, he was furnished
with as much business of that kind as he could possibly
manage, and wrote some pamphlets on the
reigning controversies of that time, that had the
good fortune to please. He was also concerned
in a monthly journal of literature, and the work
was carried on by the two friends jointly, tho'
M&wblank; did not at all appear in the partnership. 
By these means he not only spent his mornings
in useful exercise, but supplied himself with money
for what the French call the menus plaisirs,
during the whole summer. He frequented all the
assemblies in and about London, and considerably
enlarged his acquaintance among the fair sex. 
He had, upon his first arrival in England, become
acquainted with a lady at an assembly not
far from London; and tho', at that time, he had
no thoughts of extending his views farther than
the usual gallantry of the place, he met with such
distinguishing marks of her regard in the sequel,
and was so particularly encouraged by the advice
of another lady, with whom he had been intimate
in France, and who was now of their parties, that
he could not help entertaining hopes of making an
impression upon the heart of his agreeable partner,
who was a young lady of an ample fortune, and
great expectations. He, therefore, cultivated her
good graces with all the assiduity and address of 

which he was master; and succeeded so well in
his endeavours, that after a due course of attendance,
and the death of an aunt, by which she
received an accession of fortune, to the amount of
three and twenty thousand pounds, he ventured
to declare his passion, and she not only heard
him with patience and approbation, but also replied
in terms adequate to his warmest wish. 
Finding himself so favourably received, he
pressed her to secure his happiness by marriage; 
but, to this proposal, she objected the recency of
her kinswoman's death, which would have rendered
such a step highly indecent, and the displeasure
of her other relations, from whom she
had still greater expectations, and who at that
time importuned her to marry a cousin of her
own, whom she could not like. However, that
M&wblank; might have no cause to repine at her delay,
she freely entered with him into an intimacy of
correspondence; during which, nothing could
have added to their mutual felicity, which was
the more poignant and refined, from the mysterious
and romantic manner of their enjoying it; 
for, tho' he publickly visited her as an acquaintance,
his behaviour, on these occasions, was always
so distant, respectful, and reserved, that the
rest of the company could not possibly suspect the
nature of their reciprocal attachment: in consequence
of which, they used to have private interviews,
unknown to every soul upon earth, except
her maid, who was necessarily intrusted with
the secret. 
In this manner they enjoyed the conversation of
each other for above twelve months, without the
least interruption; and tho' the stability of Mr.
M&wblank;'s fortune intirely depended upon their marriage, 

yet as he perceived his mistress so averse to
it, he never urged it with vehemence, nor was at
all anxious on that score; being easily induced to
defer a ceremony which, as he then thought,
could in no shape have added to their satisfaction,
tho' he hath since altered his sentiments. 
Be that as it will, his indulgent mistress, in
order to set his mind at ease in that particular,
and in full confidence of his honour, insisted on
his accepting a deed of gift of her whole fortune,
in consideration of their intended marriage; and
after some difficulty, he was prevailed upon to
receive this proof of her esteem, well knowing
that it would still be in his power to return the
obligation. Tho' she often intreated him to take
upon himself the intire administration of her
finances, and upon divers occasions pressed him
to accept of large sums, he never once abused
her generous disposition, or solicited her for
money, except for some humane purpose, which
she was always more ready to fulfil than he to
propose. 
In the course of this correspondence, he became
acquainted with some of her female relations; 
and, among the rest, with a young lady,
so eminently adorned with all the qualifications of
mind and person, that, notwithstanding all his
philosophy and caution, he could not behold and
converse with her, without being deeply smitten
with her charms. He did all in his power to discourage
this dangerous invasion in the beginning,
and to conceal the least symptom of it from her
relation: he summoned all his reflection to his
aid; and thinking it would be base and dishonest
to cherish any sentiment, repugnant to the affection
which he owed to a mistress, who had placed
such unlimited confidence in him, he attempted 

to stifle the infant flame by avoiding the amiable
inspirer of it. But the passion had taken too
deep a root in his heart, to be so easily extirpated:
his absence from the dear object, increased the
impatience of his love. The intestine conflict
between that and gratitude, deprived him of his
rest and appetite. He was, in a short time,
emaciated by continual watching, anxiety, and
want of nourishment; and so much altered from
his usual chearfulness, that his mistress being surprised
and alarmed at the change, which, from
the symptoms, she judged was owing to some
uneasiness of mind, took all imaginable pains to
discover the cause. 
In all probability, it did not escape her penetration; 
for she, more than once, asked if he was
in love with her cousin; protesting that, far from
being an obstacle to his happiness, she would, in
that case, be an advocate for his passion. However,
this declaration was never made without
manifest signs of anxiety and uneasiness, which
made such an impression upon the heart of M&wblank;,
that he resolved to sacrifice his happiness, and even
his life, rather than take any step which might be
construed into an injury or insult to a person who
had treated him with such generosity and goodness. 
In consequence of this resolution, he formed
another which was to go abroad, under pretence
of recovering his health, but in reality, to avoid
the temptation, as well as the suspicion of being
inconstant; and in this design he was confirmed
by his physician, who actually thought him in the
first stage of a consumption, and therefore advised
him to repair to the south of France. He
communicated his design, with the doctor's opinion, 

to the lady, who agreed to it with much less
difficulty than he found in conquering his own
reluctance, at parting with the dear object of his
love. The consent of his generous mistress being
obtained, he waited upon her with the instrument
whereby she had made the conveyance of her fortune
to him; and all his remonstrances being insufficient
to persuade her to take it back, he cancelled
it in her presence, and placed it in that
state, upon her toilet, while she was dressing; 
whereupon she shed a torrent of tears, saying she
now plainly perceived that he wanted to tear
himself from her, and that his affections were
settled upon another. He was sensibly affected
by this proof of her concern; and endeavoured
to calm the perturbation of her mind, by vowing
eternal fidelity, and pressing her to accept of
his hand in due form, before his departure. By
these means her transports were quieted for the
present, and the marriage deferred, for the same
prudential reasons which had hitherto prevented
it. 
Matters being thus compromised, and the day
fixed for his departure, she, together with
her faithful maid, one morning visited him
for the first time at his own lodgings; and
after breakfast, desiring to speak with him in private,
he conducted her into another room, where
assuming an unusual gravity of aspect, “My dear
M&wblank; (said she) you are now going to leave
me, and God alone knows if ever we shall meet
again: therefore, if you really love me with that
tenderness which you profess, you will accept of
this mark of my friendship and unalterable affection:
it will at least be a provision for your journey; 
and if any accident should befal me, before
I have the happiness of receiving you again into 

my arms, I shall have the satisfaction of knowing
that you are not altogether without resource.” 
So saying, she put an embroidered pocket-book
into his hand. He expressed the high sense he
had of her generosity and affection in the most
pathetic terms, and begg'd leave to suspend his
acceptance, until he should know the contents of
her present, which was so extraordinary, that he
absolutely refused to receive it: he was, however,
by her repeated intreaties, in a manner
compelled to receive about one half, and she afterwards
insisted upon his taking a reinforcement
of a considerable sum for the expence of his
journey. 
Having stayed with her ten days beyond the
time he had fixed for his departure, and settled
the method of their correspondence, he took his
leave with an heart full of sorrow, anxiety and
distraction, produced from the different suggestions
of his duty and love. He then set out for
France, and after a short stay at Paris, proceeded
for Aix in Provence, and from thence to Marseilles,
at which two places he continued for
some months: but nothing he met with being
able to dissipate those melancholy ideas which
still preyed upon his imagination, and affected his
spirits, he endeavoured to elude them with a succession
of new objects; and with that view, persuaded
a counsellor of the parliament of Aix, a
man of great worth, learning and good humour,
to accompany him, in making a tour of those parts
of France which he had not yet seen. On their
return from this excursion, they found at Aix an
Italian Abbé, a person of character, and great
knowledge of men and books, who having travelled 

all over Germany and France, was so far
on his return to his own country. 
M&wblank; having, by means of his friend the
counsellor, contracted an acquaintance with this
gentleman, and being desirous of seeing some
parts of Italy, particularly the carnival at Venice,
they set out together from Marseilles, in a tartan,
for Genoa, coasting it all the way, and lying
on shore every night. Having shewn him what
was most remarkable in this city, his friend the
Abbé was so obliging, as to conduct him thro'
Tuscany, and the most remarkable cities in Lombardy,
to Venice, where M&wblank; insisted upon
defraying the expence of the whole tour, in consideration
of the Abbé's complaisance, which had
been of infinite service to him, in the course of
this expedition. Having remained five weeks at
Venice, he was preparing to set out for Rome
with some English gentlemen whom he had met
by accident, when he was all of a sudden obliged
to change his resolution, by some disagreeable
letters which he received from London. 
Ye had, from his first departure, corresponded
with his generous, though inconstant mistress,
with a religious exactness and punctuality; nor
was she, for some time, less observant of the
agreement they had made. Nevertheless, she,
by degrees, became so negligent and cold in her
expression, and so slack in her correspondence,
that he could not help observing and upbraiding
her with such indifference; and her endeavours
to palliate it were supported by pretexts so frivolous,
as to be easily seen through by a lover of
very little discernment. 
While he tortured himself with conjectures
about the cause of this unexpected change, he 

received such intelligence from England, as,
when joined with what he himself had perceived,
by her manner of writing, left him little or no
room to doubt of her fickleness and inconstancy. 
Nevertheless, as he knew by experience, that informations
of that kind are not to be intirely relied
upon, he resolved to be more certainly apprized; 
and for that end, departed immediately
for London, by the way of Tirol, Bavaria, Alsace
and Paris. 
On his arrival in England, he learned with infinite
concern, that his intelligence had not been
at all exaggerated; and his sorrow was inexpressible,
to find a person, endowed with so many
other noble and amiable qualities seduced into
an indiscretion, that, of necessity, must ruin the
whole plan which had been concerted between
them for their mutual happiness. She made
several attempts, by letters and interviews, to
palliate her conduct, and soften him into a reconciliation; 
but his honour being concerned, he
remained deaf to all her intreaties and proposals. 
Nevertheless, I have often heard him say, that
he could not help loving her, and revering the
memory of a person to whose generosity and
goodness he owed his fortune, and one whose
foibles were over balanced by a thousand good
qualities. He often insisted on a restitution; but,
far from complying with that proposal, she hath
afterwards often endeavoured to lay him under
yet greater obligations of the same kind, and
importuned him, with the warmest solicitations,
to renew their former correspondence, which he
as often declined. 

M&wblank; took this instance of the inconstancy
of the sex so much to heart, that he had almost
resolved, for the future, to keep clear of all engagements
for life, and returned to Paris, in order
to dissipate his anxiety, where he hired an
apartment in one of the academies in the exercises
whereof he took singular delight. During
his residence at this place, he had the good
fortune to ingratiate himself with a great general,
a descendant of one of the most ancient and illustrious
families in France; having attracted his
notice by some remarks he had written on Folard's
Polybius, which were accidentally shewn
to that great man by one of his aids du camp,
who was a particular friend of M&wblank;. The
favour he had thus acquired, was strengthened by
his assiduities and attention. Upon his return to
London, he sent some of Handel's newest compositions
to the prince, who was particularly fond
of that gentleman's productions; together with
Clark's edition of Cæsar; and in the spring of
the same year, before the French army took the
field, he was honoured with a most obliging letter
from the prince, inviting him to come over,
if he wanted to see the operations of the campaign,
and desiring he would give himself no
trouble about his equipage. 
M&wblank; having still some remains of a military
disposition, and conceiving this to be a more favourable
opportunity than any he should ever
meet with again, readily embraced the offer, and
sacrificed the soft delights of love, which at that
time he enjoyed without controul, to an eager,
laborious and dangerous curiosity. In that and
the following campaign, during which he was
present at the siege of Philipsburg, and several 

other actions, he enlarged his acquaintance among
the French officers, especially those of the graver
sort, who had a taste for books and literature; 
and the friendship and interest of those gentlemen
were afterwards of singular service to him, tho'
in an affair altogether foreign from their profession. 
He had all along made diligent inquiry into the
trade and manufactures of the countries through
which he had occasion to travel, more particularly
those of Holland, England and France; 
and as he was well acquainted with the revenue
and farms of this last kingdom, he saw with concern
the great disadvantages under which our tobacco-trade
(the most considerable branch of our
commerce with that people) was carried on; 
what inconsiderable returns were made to the
planters, out of the low price given by the French
company; and how much it was in the power
of that company to reduce it still lower. M&wblank; 
had formed a scheme to remedy this evil, so far
as it related to national loss or gain, by not permitting
the duty of one penny in the pound, old
subsidy, to be drawn back, on tobacco re-exported. 
He demonstrated to the ministry of that
time, that so inconsiderable a duty could not in
the least diminish the demand from abroad, which
was the only circumstance to be apprehended,
and that the yearly produce of that revenue would
amount to one hundred and twenty thousand
pounds, without one shilling additional expence
to the public: but the ministry having the excise-scheme
then in contemplation, could think of no
other, till that should be tried; and that project having
miscarried, he renewed his application, when
they approved of his scheme in every particular, 

but discovered a surprising backwardness to carry
it into execution. 
His expectations in this quarter being disappointed,
he, by the interposition of his friends,
presented a plan to the French company, in which
he set forth the advantages that would accrue to
themselves, from fixing the price, securing that
sort of tobacco which best suited the taste of the
public and their manufacture; and finally, proposed
to furnish them with any quantity, at
the price which they paid in the port of London. 
After some dispute, they agreed to his proposal,
and contracted with him for fifteen thousand
hogsheads a year, for which they obliged
themselves to pay ready money, on its arrival in
any one or more convenient ports in the south or
western coasts of Great Britain, that he should
please to fix upon for that purpose. M&wblank; no
sooner obtained this contract, than he immediately
set out for America, in order to put it in
execution; and, by way of companion, carried
with him a little French abbé, a man of humour,
wit and learning, with whom he had been long
acquainted, and for whom he had done many
good offices. 
On his arrival in Virginia, which opportunely
happened at a time when all the gentlemen were
assembled in the capital of that province, he published
a memorial, representing the disadvantages
under which their trade was carried on, the true
method of redressing their own grievances in
that respect, and proposing to contract with them
for the yearly quantity of fifteen thousand hogsheads
of such tobacco as was fit for the French
market, at a price which he demonstrated to be 

considerably greater than that which they had
formerly received. 
This remonstrance met with all the success
and encouragement he could expect: the principal
planters seeing their own interest concerned,
readily assented to the proposal, which, by
their influence, was also relished by the rest; 
and the only difficulty that remained, related to
the security for payment of the bills on the arrival
of the tobacco in England, and to the time
stipulated for the continuance of the contract. 
In order to remove these objections, Mr. M&wblank; 
returned to Europe, and found the French company
of farmers disposed to agree to every thing
he desired for facilitating the execution of the
contract, and perfectly well pleased with the
sample which he had already sent: but his good
friend the abbé, (whom he had left behind him in
America) by an unparalleled piece of treachery,
found means to overturn the whole project. He
secretly wrote a memorial to the company, importing,
that he found by experience, M&wblank; 
could afford to furnish them at a much lower
price than that which they had agreed to give; 
and that, by being in possession of the contract
for five years, as was intended according to the
proposal, he would have the company so much in
his power, that they must afterwards submit to
any price he should please to impose; and that if
they thought him worthy of such a trust, he
would undertake to furnish them at an easier rate,
in conjunction with some of the leading men in
Virginia and Maryland, with whom, he said, he
had already concerted measures for that purpose. 
The company were so much alarmed at these
insinuations, that they declined complying with 

Mr. M&wblank;'s demands until the abbé's return; 
and though they afterwards used all their endeavours
to persuade him to be concerned with that
little traitor in his undertaking, (by which he
might still have been a very considerable gainer)
he resisted all their solicitations, and plainly told
them in the abbé's presence, that he would never
prostitute his own principles so far, as to
enter into engagements of any kind with a person
of his character, much less in a scheme that had
a manifest tendency to lower the market-price of
tobacco in England. 
Thus ended a project the most extensive, simple
and easy, and (as appeared by the trial made)
the best calculated to raise an immense fortune,
of any that was ever undertaken or planned by a
private person; a project, in the execution of
which, M&wblank; had the good of the public, and
the glory of putting in a flourishing condition
that valuable branch of our trade, (which gives
employment to two great provinces, and above
two hundred sail of ships) much more at heart
than his own private interest. It was reasonable
to expect, that a man, whose debts M&wblank; had
paid more than once, whom he had obliged in
many other respects, and whom he had carried
with him, at a very considerable expence, on
this expedition, merely with a view of bettering
his fortune, would have acted with common honesty,
if not with gratitude: but such was the
depravity of this little monster's heart, that on
his death-bed he left a considerable fortune to
mere strangers, with whom he had little or no
connexion, without the least thought of refunding
the money advanced for him by M&wblank;, in
order to prevent his rotting in jail. 

When M&wblank; had once obtained a command
of money, he, by his knowledge in several
branches of trade, as well as by the assistance of
some intelligent friends at Paris and London,
found means to employ it to very good purpose; 
and had he been a man of that selfish disposition,
which too much prevails in the world, he might
have been, at this day, master of a very ample
fortune: but his ear was never deaf to the voice
of distress, nor his beneficent heart shut against
the calamities of his fellow-creatures. He was even
ingenious in contriving the most delicate methods
of relieving modest indigence, and, by his industrious
benevolence, often anticipated the requests
of misery. 
I could relate a number of examples to illustrate
my assertions, in some of which you would
perceive the most disinterested generosity; but such
a detail would trespass too much upon your time,
and I do not pretend to dwell upon every minute
circumstance of his conduct. Let it suffice to
say, that, upon the declaration of war with Spain,
he gave up all his commercial schemes, and called
in his money from all quarters, with a view of
sitting down, for the rest of his life, contented
with what he had got, and restraining his liberalities
to what he could spare from his yearly
income. This was a very prudential resolution,
could he have kept it: but, upon the breaking
out of that war, he could not, without concern,
see many gentlemen of merit, who had
been recommended to him, disappointed of commissions,
meerly for want of money to satisfy
the expectations of the commission-brokers of
that time; and therefore launched out considerable
sums for them on their bare notes, great 

part whereof was lost by the death of some in
the unfortunate expedition to the West-Indies. 
He, at length, after many other actions of the
like nature, from motives of pure humanity,
love of justice, and abhorrence of oppression,
embarked in a cause, every way the most important
that ever came under the discussion of the
courts of law in these kingdoms; whether it be
considered in relation to the extraordinary nature
of the case, or the immense property of no less
than fifty thousand pounds a year, and three
peerages, that depended upon it. 
In the year 1740, the brave admiral who at
that time commanded his majesty's fleet in the
West-Indies, among the other transactions of his
squadron, transmitted to the duke of Newcastle,
mentioned a young man, who, tho' in the capacity
of a common sailor on board one of the ships
under his command, laid claim to the estate and
titles of the earl of A&wblank;. These pretensions
were no sooner communicated in the public papers,
than they became the subject of conversation
in all companies; and the person whom they
chiefly affected, being alarmed at the appearance
of a competitor, tho' at such distance, began to
put himself in motion, and take all the precautions
which he thought necessary to defeat the
endeavours of the young upstart. Indeed, the
early intelligence he received of Mr. A&wblank;y's
making himself known in the West-Indies, furnished
him with numberless advantages over that
unhappy young gentleman: for, being in possession
of a plentiful fortune, and lord of many
manors in the neighbourhood of the very place
where the claimant was born, he knew all the
witnesses who could give the most material 

evidence of his legitimacy; and, if his probity
did not restrain him, had, by his power and influence,
sufficient opportunity and means of applying
to the passions and interests of the witnesses,
to silence many, and gain over others to his side:
while his competitor, by an absence of fifteen or
sixteen years from his native country, the want
of education and friends, together with his
present helpless situation, was rendered absolutely
incapable of taking any step for his own
advantage. And although his worthy uncle's
conspicuous virtue, and religious regard for justice
and truth, might possibly be an unconquerable
restraint to his taking any undue advantages; 
yet the consciences of that huge army of
emissaries he kept in pay, were not altogether so
very tender and scrupulous. This much, however,
may be said, without derogation from, or
impeachment of the noble earl's nice virtue and
honour, that he took care to compromise all differences
with the other branches of the family,
whose interests were, in this affair, connected
with his own, by sharing the estate with them, and
also retained most of the eminent council within
the bar of both kingdoms against this formidable
bastard, before any suit was instituted by him. 
While he was thus entrenching himself against
the attack of a poor forlorn youth, at the distance
of fifteen hundred leagues, continually exposed
to the dangers of the sea, the war, and an unhealthy
climate, Mr. M&wblank;, in the common
course of conversation, chanced to ask some
questions relating to this romantic pretender, of
one H&wblank;, who was at that time the present
lord A&wblank;y's chief agent. This man, when
pressed, could not help owning that the late lord 

A&wblank;m actually left a son, who had been spirited
away into America, soon after his father's death; 
but said he did not know whether this was the
same person. 
This information could not fail to make an
impression on the humanity of Mr. M&wblank;, who,
being acquainted with the genius of the wicked
party who had possessed themselves of this unhappy
young man's estate and honours, expressed
no small anxiety and apprehension lest they should
take him off by some means or other; and, even
then, seemed disposed to contribute towards the
support of the friendless orphan, and to enquire
more circumstantially into the nature of his claim. 
In the mean time his occasions called him to
France; and, during his absence, Mr. A&wblank;y
arrived in London, in the month of October
1741.—” 
Here the clergyman was interrupted by Peregrine,
who said there was something so extraordinary,
not to call it improbable, in the account
he had heard of the young gentleman's
being sent into exile, that he would look upon
himself as infinitely obliged to the doctor, if he
would favour him with a true representation of
that transaction, as well as of the manner in
which he arrived and was known at the island of
Jamaica. 
The parson, in compliance with our hero's
request, taking up the story from the beginning,
“Mr. A&wblank;y (said he) is the son of Arthur late
lord baron of A&wblank;m, by his wife Mary Sh&wblank;d,
natural daughter to John duke of B&wblank; and
N&wblank;by, whom he publickly married on the
21st day of July 1706, contrary to the inclination
of his mother, and all his other relations, 

particularly Arthur late earl of A&wblank;y, who bore
an implacable enmity to the duke her father,
and, for that reason, did all that lay in his power
to traverse the marriage: but, finding his endeavours
ineffectual, he was so much offended, that
he would never be perfectly reconciled to lord
A&wblank;m, tho' he was his presumptive heir. After
their nuptials, they cohabited together in England
for the space of two or three years; during
which she miscarried more than once: and he
being a man of levity, and an extravagant disposition,
not only squandered away all that he had
received of his wife's fortune, but also contracted
many considerable debts, which obliged him to
make a precipitate retreat into Ireland, leaving
his lady behind him in the house with his mother
and sisters; who, having also been averse to the
match, had always looked upon her with eyes
of disgust. 
It was not likely that harmony should long
subsist in this family, especially as lady A&wblank;m
was a woman of a lofty spirit, who could not
tamely bear insults and ill-usage from persons,
who, she had reason to believe, were her enemies
at heart. Accordingly a misunderstanding
soon happened among them, which was fomented
by the malice of one of her sisters-in-law: divers
scandalous reports of her misconduct, to which the
empty pretensions of a vain, wretched coxcomb
(who was made use of as an infamous tool for that
purpose) gave a colourable pretext, were trumped
up, and transmitted, with many false and aggravating
circumstances, to her husband in Ireland; who,
being a giddy, unthinking man, was so much incensed
at these insinuations, that, in the first
transports of his passion, he sent to his mother a 

power of attorney, that she might sue for a
divorce in his behalf. A libel was thereupon exhibited,
containing many scandalous allegations,
void of any real foundation in truth; but being
unsupported by any manner of proof, it was at
length dismissed with costs, after it had depended
upwards of two years. 
Lord A&wblank;m, finding himself abused by the
misrepresentations of his mother and sister, discovered
an inclination to be reconciled to his
lady: in consequence of which, she was sent over
to Dublin by her father, to the care of a gentleman
in that city; in whose house she was received
by her husband, with all the demonstrations of
love and esteem. From thence he conducted her
to his lodgings, and then to his country-house; 
where she had the misfortune to suffer a miscarriage,
through fear and resentment of my lord's
behaviour, which was often brutal and indecent. 
From the country they removed to Dublin, about
the latter end of July, or beginning of August
1714; where they had not long continued, when
her ladyship was known to be again with child. 
Lord A&wblank;m and his issue being next in remainder
to the honours and estate of Arthur earl
of A&wblank;a, was extremely solicitous to have a son; 
and, warned by the frequent miscarriages of his
lady, resolved to curb the natural impatience and
rusticity of his disposition, that she might not, as
formerly, suffer by his outrageous conduct. He
accordingly cherished her with uncommon tenderness
and care; and her pregnancy being pretty
far advanced, conducted her to his country-seat,
where she was delivered of Mr. A&wblank;y, about the
latter end of April or beginning of May; for none
of the witnesses have been able, at this distance, with
absolute certainty, to fix the precise time of his 

birth, and there was no register kept in the
parish: and, as an additional misfortune, no gentlemen
of fashion lived in that parish; nor did
those who lived at any considerable distance, care
to cultivate an acquaintance with a man of lord
A&wblank;m's strange conduct. 
Be that as it will, the occasion was celebrated
by his lordship's tenants and dependants upon
the spot, and in the neighbouring town of New
R&wblank;ss, by bonfires, illuminations, and other rejoicings; 
which have made such an impression
upon the minds of the people, that, in the place
where they happened, and the contiguous parishes,
several hundred people have already declared their
knowledge and remembrance of this event, in
spite of the great power of the claimant's adversary
in that quarter, and the great pains and indirect
methods taken by his numberless agents
and emissaries, as well as by those who are interested
with him, in the event of the suit, to
corrupt and suppress the evidence. 
Lord A&wblank;m, after the birth of this son,
who was sent to nurse in the neighbourhood,
according to the custom of the country, (where
people of the highest distinction put their children
out to nurse into farm-houses and cabbins) lived
in harmony with his lady for the space of two
years: but having, by his folly and extravagance,
reduced himself to great difficulties, he demanded
the remainder of her fortune from her father the
duke of B&wblank;, who absolutely refused to part
with a shilling, until a proper settlement should
be made on his daughter, which by that time he
had put out of his own power to do, by his folly
and extravagance. 
As her ladyship, by her endeavours to reform
the œconomy of her house, had incurred the displeasure 

of some idle, profligate fellows, who had
fastened themselves upon her husband, and helped
to consume his substance, they seized this opportunity
of the duke's refusal; and, in order to be
revenged upon the innocent lady, persuaded lord
A&wblank;m, that the only means of extracting money
from his grace would be to turn her away, on
pretence of infidelity to his bed, for which, they
hinted, there was but too much foundation. At
their suggestions, a most infamous plan was projected; 
in the execution of which, one P&wblank;, a
poor, unbred, simple, country booby, whom they
had decoyed into a snare, lost one of his ears,
and the injured lady retired that same day to New
R&wblank;ss, where she continued several years. She
did not, however, leave the house, without
struggling hard to carry her child along with her; 
but, far from enjoying such indulgence, strict
orders were given, that the boy should not, for
the future, be brought within her sight. This
base, inhuman treatment, instead of answering the
end proposed, produced such a contrary effect,
that the duke of B&wblank;, by a codicil to his will,
in which he reflects upon lord A&wblank;m's evil temper,
directed his executors to pay to his daughter
an annuity of one hundred pounds, while her lord
and she should continue to live separate; and this
allowance ceased on lord A&wblank;m's death. 
While she remained in this solitary situation,
the child was universally known and received as
the legitimate son and heir of her lord, whose affection
for the boy was so conspicuous, that in
the midst of his own necessities, he never failed
to maintain him in the dress and equipage of a
young nobleman. In the course of his infancy,
his father having often changed his place of residence, 

the child was put under the instruction of
a great many different schoolmasters, so that he
was perfectly well known in a great many different
parts of the kingdom; and his mother
seized all opportunities (which were but rare, on
account of his father's orders to the contrary) of
seeing, and giving him proofs of her maternal
tenderness, until she set out for England, after
having been long in a declining state of health,
by a paralytical disorder; upon the consequence
of which, such dependance was placed by her inconsiderate
husband, who was by this time reduced
to extreme poverty, that he actually married
a woman whom he had long kept as a mistress; 
and this creature no sooner understood
that lady Al&wblank;m was departed from Ireland, than
she openly avowed her marriage, and went about
publickly with lord A&wblank;m, visiting his acquaintances
in character of his wife. 
From this æra may be dated the beginning of
Mr. A&wblank;y's misfortunes: this artful woman,
who had formerly treated the child with an appearance
of fondness, in order to ingratiate herself
with the father, now looking upon herself
as sufficiently established in the family, thought
it was high time to alter her behaviour with regard
to the unfortunate boy; and accordingly,
for obvious reasons, employed a thousand artifices
to alienate the heart of this weak father
from his unhappy offspring: yet, notwithstanding
all her insinuations, nature still maintained her
influence in his heart; and though she often
found means to irritate him by artful and malicious
accusations, his resentment never extended
farther than fatherly correction; and she would
have found it impossible to accomplish his ruin, 

had not her efforts been reinforced by a new
auxiliary, who was no other than his uncle, the
present usurper of his title and estate; yet even
this confederacy was over-awed, in some measure,
by the fear of alarming the unfortunate
mother, till her distemper increased to a most
deplorable degree of the dead palsy, and the death
of her father had reduced her to a most forlorn
and abject state of distress. Then they ventured
upon the execution of their projects; and (though
their aims were widely different) concurred in
their endeavours to remove the hapless boy, as
the common obstacle to both. 
Lord Al&wblank;m, who (as I have already observed)
was a man of weak intellects, and utterly
void of any fixed principle of action, being,
by this time, reduced to such a pitch of misery,
that he was often obliged to pawn his wearing-apparel,
in order to procure the common necessaries
of life; and having no other fund remaining,
with which he could relieve his present necessities,
except his sale of the reversion of the
A&wblank;a estate, to which the nonage of his son
was an effectual bar, he was advised by his virtuous
brother, and the rest of his counsellors, to
surmount this difficulty, by secreting his son, and
spreading a report of his death. This honest
project he the more readily embraced, because he
knew that no act of his could frustrate the child's
succession. Accordingly, the boy was removed
from the school at which he was then boarded, to
the house of one K&wblank;gh, an agent and accomplice
of the present earl of A&wblank;a, where
he was kept for several months closely confined; 
and in the mean time, it was industriously reported
that he was dead. 

This previous measure being taken, lord A&wblank;m
published advertisements in the gazettes, offering
reversions of the A&wblank;a estate to sale; and
emissaries of various kinds were employed, to inveigle
such as were ignorant of the nature of the
settlement of these estates, or strangers to the
affairs of his family. Some people, imposed upon
by the report of the child's death, were drawn
in to purchase, thinking themselves safe in the
concurrence of his lordship's brother, upon presumption
that he was next in remainder to the
succession; others, tempted by the smallness of
the price, (which rarely exceeded half a year's
purchase, as appears by many deeds) though they
doubted the truth of the boy's being dead, ran
small risques on the contingency of his dying before
he should be of age, or in hope of his being
prevailed upon to confirm the grants of his father; 
and many more were treating with him on
the same notions, when their transactions were
suddenly interrupted, and the scheme of raising
more money, for the present, defeated by the
unexpected appearance of the boy, who being
naturally sprightly and impatient of restraint, had
found means to break from his confinement, and
wandered up and down the streets of Dublin,
avoiding his father's house, and choosing to encounter
all sorts of distress, rather than subject
himself again to the cruelty and malice of the
woman who supplied his mother's place. Thus
debarred his father's protection, and destitute of
any fixed habitation, he herded with all the loose,
idle, and disorderly youths in Dublin, skulking
chiefly about the college, several members and
students of which, taking pity on his misfortunes,
supplied him at different times with cloaths 

and money. In this unsettled and uncomfortable
way of life did he remain, from the year 1725
to the latter end of November 1727; at which
time his father died so miserably poor, that he
was actually buried at the public expence. 
This unfortunate nobleman was no sooner
dead, than his brother Richard, now earl of
A&wblank;a, taking advantage of the non-age and
helpless situation of his nephew, seized upon all
the papers of the defunct, and afterwards usurped
the title of lord A&wblank;m, to the surprize of the
servants, and others who were acquainted with
the affairs of the family. This usurpation, bold
as it was, produced no other effect than that of
his being insulted by the populace as he went
through the streets, and the refusal of the
king at arms to enrol the certificate of his brother's
having died without issue. The first of
these inconveniences he bore without any sense of
shame, tho' not without repining, conscious that
it would gradually vanish with the novelty of his
invasion; and as to the last, he conquered it by
means well known and obvious. 
Nor will it seem strange, that he should thus
invade the rights of an orphan with impunity, if
people will consider, that the late lord A&wblank;m
had not only squandered away his fortune, with
the most ridiculous extravagance, but also associated
himself with low company; so that he
was little known, and less regarded, by persons
of any rank and figure in life; and his child, of
consequence, debarred of the advantages which
might have accrued from valuable connexions. 
And tho' it was universally known, that lady
A&wblank;m had a son in Ireland, such was the obscurity
in which the father had lived, during the 

last years of his life, that few of the nobility
could be supposed to be acquainted with the particular
circumstances of a transaction in which
they had no concern, and which had happened at
the distance of twelve years before the date of this
usurpation. Moreover, as their first information
was no other than common fame, the public clamour
occasioned by the separation, might inspire
such as were strangers to the family affairs, with
a mistaken notion of the child's having been
born about or after the time of that event. The
hurry and bustle occasioned by the arrival of the
lord lieutenant about this period, the reports industriously
propagated of the claimant's death,
the obscurity and concealment in which the boy
was obliged to live, in order to elude the wicked
attempts of his uncle, might also contribute to
his peaceable enjoyment of an empty title: and
lastly, lord chancellor W&wblank;m, whose immediate
province it was to issue writs for parliament, was
an utter stranger in Ireland, unacquainted with
the descents of families, and consequently did
not examine farther than the certificate enrolled
in the books of the king at arms. Over and
above these circumstances, which naturally account
for the success of the imposture, it may be
observed, that the hapless youth had not one relation
alive, on the side of his father, whose interest
it was not to forward or connive at his
destruction; that his grand-father the duke of
B&wblank;was dead; and that his mother was then
in England, in a forlorn, destitute, dying condition,
secreted from the world, and even from
her own relations, by her woman Mary H&wblank;,
who had a particular interest to secrete her, and
altogether dependant upon a miserable and precarious 

allowance from the dutchess of B&wblank;, to
whose caprice she was moreover a most wretched
slave. 
Notwithstanding these concurring circumstances
in favour of the usurper, he did not think
himself secure while the orphan had any chance
of finding a friend who would undertake his
cause; and therefore laid a plan for his being
kidnapped, and sent to America as a slave. His
coadjutor in this humane scheme, was a person
who carried on the trade of transporting servants
to our plantations, and was deeply interested on
this occasion, having, for a meer trifle, purchased
of the late lord A&wblank;m the reversion of a considerable
part of the A&wblank;a estate; which shameful
bargain was confirmed by the brother, but
could never take place, unless the boy could be
effectually removed. 
Every thing being settled with this auxiliary,
several ruffians, were employed in search of the
unhappy victim; and the first attempt that was
made upon him, in which his uncle personally
assisted, happening near one of the great markets
of the city of Dublin, an honest butcher, with
the assistance of his neighbours, rescued him by
force from their cruel hands. This, however,
was but a short respite; for (tho', warned by this
adventure, the boy seldom crept out of his lurking
places, without the most cautious circumspection)
he was, in March 1727, discovered by
the diligence of his persecutors, and forcibly
dragged on board of a ship bound for Newcastle
on Delaware river in America, where he was
sold as a slave, and kept to hard labour, much
above his age or strength, for the space of thirteen 

years, during which he was transferred from
one person to another. 
While he remained in this servile situation, he
often mentioned, to those in whom he thought
such confidence might be placed, the circumstances
of his birth and title, together with the
manner of his being exiled from his native country; 
although, in this particular, he neglected a
caution which he had received in his passage,
importing, that such discovery would cost him
his life. Mean while the usurper quietly enjoyed
his right; and to those who questioned him about
his brother's son, constantly replied, that the
boy had been dead for several years. And Arthur
earl of A&wblank;a dying in April 1737, he, upon
pretence of being next heir, succeeded to the
honours and estate of that nobleman. 
The term of the nephew's bondage, which
had been lengthened out beyond the usual time,
on account of his repeated attempts to escape,
being expired in the year 1739, he hired himself
as a common sailor in a trading vessel bound to
Jamaica; and there, being entered on board of
one of his majesty's ships under the command of
admiral Vernon, openly declared his parentage
and pretensions. This extraordinary claim,
which made a great noise in the fleet, reaching
the ears of one lieutenant S&wblank;n, nearly related
to the usurper's Irish wife, he believed the young
gentleman to be an impostor; and thinking it
was incumbent upon him to discover the cheat,
he went on board of the ship to which the
claimant belonged, and, having heard the account
which he gave of himself, was, notwithstanding
his prepossessions, convinced of the truth of what
he alledged: and, on his return to his own ship, 

chanced to mention this extraordinary affair upon
the quarter-deck, in the hearing of Mr. B&wblank;n,
one of the midshipmen, who had formerly been
at school with Mr. A&wblank;y. This young gentleman
not only told the lieutenant, that he had
been school-fellow with lord A&wblank;m's son, but
also declared that he should know him again, if
not greatly altered, as he still retained a perfect
idea of his countenance. 
Upon this intimation, the lieutenant proposed
that the experiment should be tried; and went
with the midshipman on board the ship that the
claimant was in for that purpose. After all the sailors
had been assembled upon deck, Mr. B&wblank;n, casting
his eyes around, immediately distinguished Mr.
A&wblank;y in the croud, and laying his hand on his
shoulder, “This is the man,” said he; affirming
at the same time, that, while he continued
at school with him, the claimant was reputed
and respected as lord A&wblank;m's son and heir, and
maintained in all respects suitable to the dignity
of his rank. Nay, he was, in like manner, recognized
by several other persons in the fleet,
who had known him in his infancy. 
These things being reported to the admiral,
he generously ordered him to be supplied with
necessaries, and treated like a gentleman; and,
in his next dispatches, transmitted an account of
the affair to the duke of Newcastle, among the
other transactions of the fleet. 
In September or October 1741, Mr. A&wblank;y
arrived in London; and the first person to whom
he applied for advice and assistance, was a man of
the law, nearly related to the families of A&wblank;a
and A&wblank;m, and well acquainted with the particular
affairs of each, who, far from treating him 

as a bastard and impostor, received him with
civility and seeming kindness, asked him to eat,
presented him with a piece of money, and, excusing
himself from meddling in the affair, advised
him to go to Ireland, as the most proper
place for commencing a suit for the recovery of
his right. 
Before the young gentleman had an opportunity,
or indeed any inclination, to comply with
this advice, he was accidentally met in the street
by that same H&wblank;n, who, as I have mentioned,
gave Mr. M&wblank;r the first insight into the affair:
this man immediately knew the claimant, having
been formerly an agent for his father, and afterwards
a creature of his uncle's, with whom he
was, not without reason, suspected to be concerned
in kidnapping and transporting his nephew. 
Be that as it will, his connections with the
usurper were now broke off by a quarrel, in consequence
of which he had thrown up his agency; 
and he invited the hapless stranger to his house,
with a view of making all possible advantage of
such a guest. 
There he had not long remained, when his
treacherous landlord, tampering with his inexperience,
effected a marriage between him and the
daughter of one of his own friends, who lodged
in his house at the same time: but afterwards,
seeing no person of consequence willing to espouse
his cause, he looked upon him as an incumbrance,
and wanted to rid his hands of him accordingly. 
He remembered that Mr. M&wblank;r had
expressed himself with all the humanity of apprehension,
in favour of the unfortunate young
nobleman, before his arrival in England; and
being well acquainted with the generosity of his 

disposition, he no sooner understood that he was
returned from France, than he waited upon him
with an account of Mr. A&wblank;y's being safely arrived. 
Mr. M&wblank;r was sincerely rejoiced to
find, that a person who had been so cruelly injured,
and undergone so long and continued a scene
of distress, was restored to a country where he
was sure of obtaining justice, and where every
good man (as he imagined) would make the cause
his own: and, being informed that the youth
was in want of necessaries, he gave twenty guineas
to H&wblank;n for his use, and promised to do him all
the service in his power; but had no intention to
take upon himself the whole weight of such an
important affair, or indeed to appear in the cause,
until he should be fully and throughly satisfied
that the claimant's pretensions were well
founded. 
In the mean time, H&wblank;n insinuating that the
young gentleman was not safe in his present
lodging, from the machinations of his enemies,
M&wblank;r accommodated him with an apartment in
his own house; where he was at great pains to
remedy the defect in his education, by rendering
him fit to appear as a gentleman in the world:
and having received from him all the intelligence
he could give, relating to his own affair, laid the
case before council, and dispatched a person to
Ireland, to make further enquiries upon the same
subject; who, on his first arrival in that kingdom,
found the claimant's birth was as publickly
known as any circumstance of that kind could
possibly be, at so great a distance of time. 
The usurper and his friends gave all the interruption
in their power to any researches concerning
that affair; and had recourse to every art and 

expedient that could be invented, to prevent its
being brought to a legal discussion: privilege,
bills in chancery, orders of court surreptitiously
and illegally obtained, and every other invention,
was made use of to bar and prevent a fair and
honest trial by a jury. The usurper himself, and
his agents, at the same time that they formed
divers conspiracies against his life, in vain endeavoured
to detach Mr. M&wblank;r from the orphan's
cause by innumerable artifices, insinuating, cajoling,
and misrepresenting with surprising dexterity
and perseverance. 
His protector, far from being satisfied with their
reasons, was not only deaf to their remonstrances,
but, believing him in danger from their repeated efforts,
had him privately conveyed into the country; 
where an unhappy accident (which he hath
ever since sincerely regreted) furnished his adversary
a colourable pretext to cut him off in the
beginning of his career. 
A man happening to lose his life, by the accidental
discharge of a piece, that chanced to be
in the young gentleman's hands, the account of
this misfortune no sooner reached the ears of his
uncle, than he expressed the most immoderate
joy at having found so good a handle for destroying
him, under colour of law. He immediately
constituted himself prosecutor, set his emissaries
at work to secure a coroner's inquest suited to his
cruel purposes; set out for the place in person,
to take care that the prisoner should not escape; 
insulted him in jail, in the most inhuman manner; 
employed a whole army of attornies and
agents, to spirit up and carry on a most virulent
prosecution; practised all the unfair methods that
could be invented, in order that the unhappy 

gentleman should be transported to Newgate,
from the healthy prison to which he was at first
committed; endeavoured to inveigle him into
destructive confessions; and, not to mention other
more infamous arts employed in the affair of evidence,
attempted to surprize him upon his trial,
in the absence of his witnesses and council, contrary
to a previous agreement with the prosecutor's
own attorney: nay, he even appeared in
person upon the bench at the trial, in order to
intimidate the evidence, and brow-beat the unfortunate
prisoner at the bar, and expended above
a thousand pounds in that prosecution. In spite
of all his wicked efforts, however, which were
defeated by the spirit and indefatigable industry
of Mr. M&wblank;r, the young gentleman was honourably
acquitted, to the evident satisfaction of
all the impartial; the misfortune that gave a
handle for that unnatural prosecution, appearing
to a demonstration to have been a mere accident. 
In a few months, his protector, who had now
openly espoused his cause, (taking with him two
gentlemen to witness his transactions) conducted
him to his native country, with a view to be
better informed of the strength of his pretensions,
than he could be by the intelligences he had hitherto
received, or by the claimant's own dark
and almost obliterated remembrance of the facts
which were essential to be known. Upon their
arrival in Dublin, application was made to those
persons whom Mr. A&wblank;y had named as his
schoolmasters and companions, together with the
servants and neighbours of his father. These,
though examined separately, without having the
least previous intimation of what the claimant 

had reported, agreed in their accounts with him,
as well as with one another, and mentioned
many other people as acquainted with the same
facts to whom Mr. M&wblank;r had recourse, and
still met with the same unvaried information. By
these means, he made such progress in his inquiries,
that in less than two months no fewer
than one hundred persons, from different quarters
of the kingdom, either personally, or by letters,
communicated their knowledge of the claimant,
in declarations consonant with one another, as
well as with the accounts he gave of himself. 
Several servants who had lived with his father,
and been deceived with the story of his death,
so industriously propagated by his uncle, no sooner
heard of his being in Dublin, than they came
from different parts of the country to see him; 
and though great pains were taken to deceive
them, they, nevertheless, knew him at first sight; 
some of them fell upon their knees, to thank
heaven for his preservation, embraced his legs,
and shed tears of joy for his return. 
Although the conduct of his adversary, particularly
in the above-mentioned prosecution, together
with the evidence that already appeared,
were sufficient to convince all mankind of the
truth of the claimant's pretensions, Mr. M&wblank;r,
in order to be further satisfied, resolved to see
how he would be received upon the spot where he
was born; justly concluding, that if he was really
an impostor, the bastard of a kitchen-wench,
produced in a country intirely possessed by his
enemy and his allies, he must be looked upon in
that place with the utmost detestation and contempt. 

This his intention was no sooner known to the
adverse party, than their agents and friends, from
all quarters, repaired to that place with all possible
dispatch, and used all their influence with
the people, in remonstrances, threats, and all
the other arts they could devise, not only to discountenance
the claimant upon his arrival, but
even to spirit up a mob to insult him. Notwithstanding
these precautions, and the servile awe
and subjection in which tenants are kept by their
landlords in that part of the country, as soon as
it was known that Mr. A&wblank;y approached the
town, the inhabitants crowded out in great multitudes
to receive and welcome him, and accompanied
him into town with acclamations and other
expressions of joy, insomuch that the agents of
his adversary durst not shew their faces. The
sovereign of the corporation, who was a particular
creature and favourite of the usurper, and
whose all depended upon the issue of the cause,
was so conscious of the stranger's right, and so
much awed by the behaviour of the people, who
knew that consciousness, that he did not think it
safe, even to preserve the appearance of neutrality
upon this occasion, but actually held the
stirrup while Mr. A&wblank;y dismounted from his
horse. 
This sense of conviction in the people, manifested
itself still more powerfully, when he returned
to the same place in the year 1744, about
which time lord A&wblank;a being informed of his
resolution, determined again to be before-hand
with him, and set out in person with his agents
and friends, some of whom were detached before
him, to prepare for his reception, and induce the
people to meet him in a body, and accompany 

him to town, with such expressions of welcome
as they had before bestowed on his nephew: but
in spite of all their art and interest, he was suffered
to pass through the street in a mournful silence; 
and though several barrels of beer were
produced, to court the favour of the populace,
they had no other effect than that of drawing their
ridicule upon the donor; whereas, when Mr.
A&wblank;y, two days afterwards, appeared, all the
inhabitants, with garlands, streamers, music, and
other ensigns of joy, crowded out to meet him,
and ushered him into town with such demonstrations
of pleasure and good-will, that the noble
peer found it convenient to hide himself from the
resentment of his own tenants, the effects of
which he must have severely felt, had not he been
screened by the timely remonstrances of Mr.
M&wblank;r, and the other gentlemen who accompanied
his competitor. 
Nor did his apprehension vanish with the transactions
of this day; the town was again in uproar
on the Sunday following, when it was known
that Mr. A&wblank;y intended to come thither, from
Dunmain, to church: they went out to meet him
as before, and conducted him to the church-door
with acclamations, which terrified his uncle to
such a degree, that he fled with precipitation in
a boat, and soon after intirely quitted the place. 
It would be almost an endless task to enumerate
the particular steps that were taken by one side
to promote, and by the other to delay the trial:
the young gentleman's adversaries finding that
they could not, by all the subterfuges and arts
they had used, evade it, repeated attempts were
made to assassinate him and his protector, and
every obstruction thrown in the way of his cause 

which craft could invent, villany execute, and
undue influence confirm. But all these difficulties
were surmounted by the vigilance, constancy,
courage and sagacity of M&wblank;r; and, at last,
the affair was brought to a very solemn trial at
bar, which being continued, by several adjournments,
from the eleventh to the twenty-fifth day
of November, a verdict was found for the
claimant, by a jury of gentlemen, which, in point
of reputation and property, cannot be easily paralelled
in the annals of that or any other country; 
a jury that could by no means be suspected
of prepossessions in favour of Mr. An&wblank;y, (to
whose person they were absolute strangers) especially
if we consider that a gentleman in their
neighbourhood, who was nephew to the foreman,
and nearly related to some of the rest of their
number, forfeited a considerable estate by their
decision. 
This verdict (said the parson) gave the highest
satisfaction to all impartial persons that were within
reach of being truly informed of their proceedings,
and of the different genius and conduct
of the parties engaged in the contest; but more
especially to such as were in court (as I was) at
the trial, and had an opportunity of observing
the characters and behaviour of the persons who
appeared there to give evidence. —To such it
was very apparent, that all the witnesses produced
there on the part of the uncle, were either his
tenants, dependents, pot-companions, or persons
some way or other interested in the issue of the
suit, and remarkable for a low kind of cunning:
that many of them were persons of profligate
lives, who deserved no credit: that (independent
of the levity of their characters) those of them 

who went under the denomination of colonels,
(colonel L&wblank;fts alone excepted, who had nothing
to say, and was only brought there in order to
give credit to that party) made so ridiculous a figure,
and gave so absurd, contradictory and inconsistent
an evidence, as no court or jury could
give the least degree of credit to. —On the other
hand, it was observed, that the nephew and Mr.
M&wblank;r his chief manager, (being absolute strangers
in that country, and unacquainted with the characters
of the persons they had to deal with) were
obliged to lay before the court and jury such evidence
as came to their hand, some of whom
plainly appeared to have been put upon them by
their adversaries, with a design to hurt—It was
also manifest, that the witnesses produced for Mr.
A&wblank;y were such as could have no manner of
connexion with him, nor any dependence whatsoever
upon him, to influence their evidence; 
for the far greatest part of them had never seen
him from his infancy, till the trial began; and
that many of them (though poor and undignified
with the title of colonels) were people of unblemished
character, of great simplicity, and such as
no man in his senses would pitch upon to support
a bad cause. —It is plain that the jury, (whose
well-known honour, impartiality and penetration
must be revered by all who are acquainted with
them) were not under the least difficulty about
their verdict; for they were not inclosed above
half an hour, when they returned with it. — 
These gentlemen could not help observing the
great inequality of the parties engaged, the great
advantages that the uncle had in every other respect
(except the truth and justice of his case)
over the nephew, by means of his vast possessions, 

and of his power and influence all round
the place of his birth; nor could the contrast between
the different genius's of the two parties
escape their observation. —They could not but
see and conclude, that a person who had confessedly
transported and sold his orphan-nephew
into slavery, who, on his return, had carried on
so unwarrantable and cruel a prosecution to take
away his life, under colour of law, and who had
also given such glaring proofs of his skill and dexterity
in the management of witnesses for that
cruel purpose, was in like manner capable of exerting
the same happy talent on this occasion,
when his all was at stake; more especially, as he
had so many others who were equally interested
with himself, and whose abilities, in that respect,
fell nothing short of his own, to second him in
it. —The gentlemen of the jury had also a near
view of the manner in which the witnesses delivered
their testimonies, and had from thence an
opportunity of observing many circumstances and
distinguishing characteristics of truth and falshood,
from which a great deal could be gathered, that
could not be adequately conveyed by any printed
account, how exact soever; consequently, they
must have been much better judges of the evidence
on which they founded their verdict, than
any person, who had not the same opportunity,
can possibly be. 
These, Mr. Pickle, were my reflections on
what I had occasion to observe concerning that
famous trial; and on my return to England two
years after, I could not help pitying the self-sufficiency
of some people, who, at this distance,
pretended to pass their judgment on that verdict
with as great positiveness, as if they had been in 

the secrets of the cause, or upon the jury who
tried it; and that from no better authority; than
the declamations of lord An&wblank;a's emissaries,
and some falsified printed accounts, artfully cooked
up, on purpose to mislead and deceive. 
But to return from this digression, lord A&wblank;a,
the defendant in that cause, was so conscious of
the strength and merits of his injured nephew's
case, and that a verdict would go against him,
that he ordered a writ of error to be made out
before the trial was ended; and the verdict was
no sooner given, than he immediately lodged it,
though he well knew he had no manner of error
to assign. This expedient was practised merely
for vexation and delay, in order to keep Mr. A&wblank;y
from the possession of the small estate he had recovered
by the verdict; that, his slender funds
being exhausted, he might be deprived of other
means to prosecute his right; and, by the most
oppressive contrivances and scandalous chicanery,
it has been kept up to this day, without his being
able to assign the least shadow of any error. 
Lord A&wblank;a was not the only antagonist
that Mr. A&wblank;y had to deal with; all the different
branches of the A&wblank;a family, who had
been worrying one another at law ever since the
death of the late earl of A&wblank;a, about the partition
of his great estate, were now firmly united
in an association against this unfortunate gentleman; 
mutual deeds were executed among them,
by which many great lordships and estates were
given up by the uncle to persons who had no
right to possess them, in order to engage them to
side with him against his nephew, in withholding
the unjust possession of the remainder. 

These confederates having held several consultations
against their common enemy, and finding
that his cause gathered daily strength since the trial,
by the accession of many witnesses of figure and
reputation, who had not been heard of before; 
and that the only chance they had to prevent the
speedy establishment of his right, and their own
destruction, was by stripping Mr. M&wblank;r of the
little money that yet remained, and stopping all
further resources whereby he might be enabled to
proceed; they, therefore, came to a determined
resolution to carry that hopeful scheme into execution; 
and, in pursuance thereof, they have left
no expedient or stratagem, how extraordinary or
scandalous soever, unpractised to distress Mr.
An&wblank;y and that gentleman. For that end, all
the oppressive arts and dilatory expensive contrivances
that the fertile invention of the lowest
pettifoggers of the law could possibly devise, have
with great dexterity been played off against them
in fruitless, quibbling, and malicious suits, intirely
foreign to the merits of the cause. Not to mention
numberless other acts of oppression, the most
extraordinary and unprecedented proceedings, by
means whereof this sham writ of error hath been
kept on foot ever since November 1743, is to
me (said the doctor) a most flagrant instance,
not only of the prevalency of power and money,
(when employed, as in the present case, against an
unfortunate, helpless man, disabled, as he is, of
the means of ascertaining his right) but of the
badness of a cause, that hath recourse to so many
iniquitous expedients to support it. 
In a word, the whole conduct of lord A&wblank;a
and his party, from the beginning to this time,
hath been such, as sufficiently manifests, that it 

could proceed from no other motives than a consciousness
of Mr. A&wblank;y's right, and of their own
illegal usurpations, and from a terror of trusting
the merits of their case to a fair discussion by the
laws of their country: and that the intention and
main drift of all their proceedings plainly tends to
stifle and smother the merits of the case from the
knowledge of the world, by oppressive arts and
and ingenious delays, rather than trust it to the
candid determination of an honest jury. What
else could be the motives of kid-knapping the
claimant, and transporting him when an infant?
of the various attempts made upon his life since
his return? of the attempts to divest him of all
assistance to ascertain his right, by endeavouring
so solicitously to prevail on Mr. M&wblank;r to abandon
him in the beginning? of retaining an army of
counsel, before any suit had been commenced?
of the many sinister attempts to prevent the trial
at bar? of the various arts made use of to terrify
any one from appearing as witness for the
claimant, and to seduce those who had appeared?
of the shameless, unprecedented, low tricks now
practised, to keep him out of the possession of that
estate for which he had obtained the verdict, thereby
to disable him from bringing his cause to a fur-hearing,
and of the attempts made to buy up
Mr. M&wblank;'s debts, and to spirit up suits
against him? Is it not obvious from all these circumstances,
as well as from the obstruction they
have given to the attorney-general's proceeding to
make a report to his majesty, on the claimant's petition
to the King for the peerage, which was referred
by his majesty to that gentleman, so far back
as 1743; that all their efforts are bent to that one
point of stifling, rather than suffering the merits of 

this cause to come to a fair and candid hearing; 
and that the sole consideration at present between
them and this unfortunate man is not, whether
he is right or wrong, but whether he shall or shall
not find money to bring this cause to a final determination. 
Lord A&wblank;a and his confederates not thinking
themselves safe with all these expedients, while
there was a possibility of their antagonist's obtaining
any assistance from such as humanity,
compassion, generosity, or a love of justice might
induce to lay open their purses to his assistance,
in ascertaining his right, have, by themselves and
their numerous emissaries, employed all the arts
of calumny, slander and detraction against him,
by traducing his cause, vilifying his person, and
most basely and cruelly tearing his character to
pieces, by a thousand misrepresentations, purposely
invented and industriously propagated in all
places of resort, which is a kind of cowardly assassination
that there is no guarding against: yet,
in spite of all these machinations, and the shameful
indifference of mankind, who stand aloof unconcerned,
and see this unhappy gentleman most inhumanly
oppressed by the weight of lawless power
and faction, M&wblank;r, far from suffering himself
to be dejected by the multiplying difficulties that
croud upon him, still exerts himself with amazing
fortitude and assiduity, and will (I doubt not)
bring the affair he began and carried on with so
so much spirit, while his finances lasted, to an
happy conclusion. 
It would exceed the bounds of my intention,
and perhaps trespass too much upon your time,
were I to enumerate the low artifices and shameful
quibbles, by which the usurper has found 

means to procrastinate the decision of the contest
between him and his hapless nephew, or to give a
detail of the damage and perplexity which Mr. M&wblank; 
has sustained and been involved in, by the treachery
and ingratitude of some who listed themselves
under him in the prosecution of this affair,
and by the villainy of others, who, under various
pretences of material discoveries they had to
make, &c. had fastened themselves upon him,
and continued to do all the mischief in their
power, until the cloven foot was detected. 
One instance, however, is so flagrantly flagitious,
that I cannot resist the inclination I feel to
relate it, as an example of the most infernal perfidy
that perhaps ever entered the human heart. 
I have already mentioned the part which H&wblank;n
acted in the beginning of M&wblank;'s connection with
the unfortunate stranger, and hinted that the
said H&wblank;n lay under many obligations to that
gentleman, before Mr. A&wblank;y's arrival in England. 
He had been chief agent to lord A&wblank;y, and, as
it afterwards appeared, received several payments
of a secret pension which that lord enjoyed, for
which he either could not, or would not account. 
His lordship, therefore, in order to compel him
to it, took out writs against him, and his house
was continually surrounded with catchpoles for
the space of two whole years. 
Mr. M&wblank; believing, from H&wblank;n's own account
of the matter, that the poor man was
greatly injured, and persecuted on account of his
attachment to the unhappy young gentleman,
did him all the good offices in his power, and
became security for him on several occasions:
nay, such was his opinion of his integrity, that
after Mr. A&wblank;y was cleared of the prosecution 

carried on against him by his uncle, his person
was trusted to the care of this hypocrite, who
desired that the young gentleman might lodge at
his house for the convenience of air, M&wblank;'s
own occasions calling him often into the country. 
Having thus, by his consummate dissimulation,
acquired such a valuable charge, he wrote a letter
to one of lord A&wblank;y's attornies, offering to
betray Mr. An&wblank;ey; provided his lordship would
settle his account, and give him a discharge for
eight hundred pounds of the pension, which he
had received, and not accounted for. Mr. M&wblank;,
informed of this treacherous proposal, immediately
removed his lodger from his house into
his own, without assigning his reasons for so
doing, until he was obliged to declare it, in
order to free himself from the importunities of
H&wblank;n, who earnestly solicited his return. This
miscreant finding himself detected, and disappointed
in his villainous design, was so much enraged
at his miscarriage, that, forgetting all the
benefits he had received from M&wblank; for a series of
years, he practised all the mischief that his malice
could contrive against him; and at length
entered into a confederacy with one G&wblank;tr&sblank;y,
and several other abandoned wretches, who, as
before said, under various pretences of being able
to make material discoveries, and otherwise to
serve the cause, had found means to be employed
in some extra-business relating to it, tho' their
real intention was to betray the claimant. 
These confederates, in conjunction with some
other auxiliaries of infamous character, being informed
that Mr. M&wblank;r was on the point of securing
a considerable sum, to enable him to prosecute Mr.
An&wblank;y's right, and to bring it to a happy conclusion, 

contrived a deep laid scheme to disappoint
him in it, and at once to ruin the cause. And
previous measures being taken for that wicked
purpose, they imposed upon the young gentleman's
inexperience and credulity, by insinuations
equally false, plausible, and malicious; to which
they at length gained his belief, by the mention
of some circumstances that gave what they alleged
an air of probability, and even of truth. 
They swore that Mr. M&wblank; had taken out an
action against him for a very large sum of money; 
that they had actually seen the writ; that the
intention of it was to throw him into prison for
life, and ruin his cause, in consequence of an
agreement made by him with lord A&wblank;ey, and
his other enemies, to retrieve the money that
he had laid out in the cause. 
This plausible tale was enforced with such an
air of truth, candor, and earnest concern for his
safety, and was strengthened by so many imprecations,
and corroborating circumstances of their
invention, as would have staggered one of much
greater experience, and knowledge of mankind,
than Mr. A&wblank;ey could be supposed at that time. 
The notion of perpetual imprisonment, and the
certain ruin they made him believe his cause was
threatened with, worked upon his imagination to
such a degree, that he suffered himself to be led
like a lamb to the slaughter, by this artful band
of villains; who secreted him at the lodgings of
one Pr&wblank;nt&wblank;ce, an intimate of G&wblank;y's, for
several days, under colour of his being hunted
by bailiffs employed by Mr. M&wblank;, where he was
not only obliged by them to change his name,
but even his wife was not suffered to have access
to him. 

Their design was to have sold him, or drawn
him into a ruinous compromise with his adversaries,
for a valuable consideration to themselves. 
But as no ties are binding among such a knot of
villains, the rest of the conspirators were jockied
by G&wblank;st&wblank;ey; who, in order to monopolize the
advantage to himself, hurried his prize into the
country, and secreted him even from his confederates,
in a place of concealment one hundred
miles from London, under the same ridiculous
pretence of M&wblank;'s having taken out of a writ
against him, and of bailiffs being in pursuit of
him every where round London. 
He was no sooner there than G&wblank;st&wblank;ey, as a
previous step to the other villany he intended,
tricked him out of a bond for six thousand pounds,
under colour of his having a person ready to advance
the like sum upon it, as an immediate fund
for carrying on his cause; assuring him, at the
same time, that he had a set of gentlemen ready,
who were willing to advance twenty-five thousand
pounds more for the same purpose, and to
allow him five hundred pounds a year for his
maintenance, 'till his cause should be made an
end of, provided that Mr. M&wblank; should have no
further concern with him or his cause. 
Mr. A&wblank;ey, having by this time received some
intimations of the deceit that had been put upon
him, made answer, that he should look upon
himself as a very ungrateful monster, indeed, if
he deserted a person who had saved his life, and
so generously ventured his own, together with
his fortune, in his cause, until he should first be
certain of the truth of what was alleged of him,
and absolutely rejected the proposal. G&wblank;st&wblank;ey,
who had no other view in making it than to 

cover the secret villany he meditated against him,
and to facilitate the execution thereof; easily receded
from it, when he found Mr. A&wblank;ey so
averse to it, and undertook nevertheless to raise
the money; adding, that he might, if he pleased,
return to Mr. M&wblank; whenever it was secured. 
The whole drift of this pretended undertaking to
raise the twenty-five thousand pounds, was only
to lay a foundation for a dexterous contrivance
to draw Mr. A&wblank;ey unwarily into the execution
of a deed, relinquishing all his right and title,
under a notion of its being a deed to secure the
repayment of that sum. 
G&wblank;st&wblank;ey having, as he imagined, so far
paved the way for the execution of such a deed,
enters into an agreement with an agent, employed
for that purpose by Mr. A&wblank;ey's adversaries,
purporting, that in consideration of the
payment of a bond for six thousand pounds, which
he, G&wblank;st&wblank;ey, had, as he pretended, laid out in
Mr. A&wblank;ey's cause, and of an annuity of seven
hundred pounds a year, he was to procure for
them from Mr. A&wblank;ey a deed, ready executed,
relinquishing all right and title to the An&wblank;ey
estate and honours. Every thing being prepared
for the execution of this infernal scheme, unknown
to Mr. A&wblank;ey, G&wblank;st&wblank;ey then thought
proper to send for him to town from his retirement,
in order, as he pretended, to execute a
security for twenty-five thousand pounds. 
This intended victim to that villain's avarice,
no sooner arrived in town, full of hopes of money
to carry on his cause, and of agreeably surprising
his friend and protector Mr. M&wblank; with so seasonable
and unexpected a reinforcement, than
an unforeseen difficulty arose, concerning the payment 

of G&wblank;st&wblank;ey's six thousand pound bond. 
That money was to have been raised out of the
estate of a lunatic, which could not be done
without the leave of the Court of Chancery, to
whom an account must have been given of the
intended application of it. While preparations
were making to rectify this omission, G&wblank;st&wblank;ey
immediately carried Mr. A&wblank;ey again into the
country, lest he should happen to be undeceived
by some means or other. 
In the mean time, this wicked machination
was providentially discovered by Mr. M&wblank;r, before
it could be carried into execution, by means
of the jealousies that arose among the conspirators
themselves; and was, at the same time, confirmed
to him by a person whom the very agent
for the An&wblank;ey party had entrusted with the
secret. M&wblank;r no sooner detected it than he communicated
his discovery to one of Mr. A&wblank;ey's
council, a man of great worth; and immediately
thereupon, took proper measures to defeat
it. He then found means to lay open to Mr.
A&wblank;ey himself, the treacherous scheme that was
laid for his destruction: he was highly sensible of
it; and could never afterwards reflect on the
snare that he had so unwarily been drawn into,
and had so narrowly escaped, without a mixture
of horror, shame, and gratitude to his deliverer. 
The consummate assurance of the monsters
who were engaged in this plot, after they had
been detected, and upbraided with their treachery,
is scarce to be parallelled; for they not only
owned the fact of spiriting Mr. A&wblank;ey away, in
the manner abovementioned, but justified their
doing it, as tending to his service. They also
maintained, that they had actually secured the 

twenty-five thousand pounds for him, tho' they
never could name any one person who was to
have advanced the money. No man was more
active in this scheme than H&wblank;n; nor any man
more solicitous to keep Mr. A&wblank;ey up in the false
impressions he had received, or in projecting methods
to ruin his protector, than he. 
Among many other expedients for that purpose,
a most malicious attempt was made to lodge
an information against him, for treasonable practices,
with the secretary of state, notwithstanding
the repeated proofs he had given of his loyalty; 
and, as a preparatory step to this accusation, a
letter, which this traitor dictated, was copied by
another person, and actually sent to the earl of
C&wblank;d, importing, that the person who
copied the letter had an affair of consequence to
communicate to his lordship, if he would appoint
a time for receiving the information. But that
person, upon full conviction of the villany of the
scheme, absolutely refused to proceed further in
it; so that his malice once more proved abortive:
and before he had time to execute any other contrivance
of the same nature, he was imprisoned
in this very jail for debt. 
Here, finding his creditors inexorable, and
himself destitute of all other resource, he made
application to the very man whom he had injured
in such an outrageous manner, set forth his deplorable
case in the most pathetic terms, and intreated
him, with the most abject humility, to
use his influence in his behalf. The distress of
this varlet immediately disarmed M&wblank;r of his
resentment, and even excited his compassion; 
and, without sending any answer to his remonstrances,
he interceded for him with his creditors: 

and the person to whom he was chiefly indebted,
refusing to release him without security,
this unwearied benefactor joined with the prisoner
in a bond for above one hundred and forty pounds,
by which he obtained his release. 
He was no sooner discharged, however, than
he entered into fresh combinations with G&wblank;y
and others, in order to thwart his deliverer in his
schemes of raising money, and otherwise to distress
and deprive him of liberty; for which purpose,
no art or industry (perjury not excepted)
hath been spared. And, what is still more extraordinary,
this perfidious monster having found
money to take up the bond, in consequence of
which he regained his freedom, hath procured a
writ against M&wblank;r, upon that very obligation; 
and taken assignments to some other debts of that
gentleman, with the same christian intention. 
But, hitherto, he hath, by surprising sagacity
and unshaken resolution, baffled all their infernal
contrivances, and retorted some of their machinations
on their own heads: and at this time,
when he is supposed by some, and represented by
others, as under the circumstances of oblivion
and despondence, he proceeds in his design with
the utmost calmness and intrepidity, meditating
schemes, and ripening measures, that will one
day confound his enemies, and attract the notice
and admiration of mankind.” 
Peregrine, having thanked the priest for his
obliging information, expressed his surprize at the
scandalous inattention of the world to an affair of
such importance; observing, that, by such inhuman
neglect, this unfortunate young gentleman,
Mr. A&wblank;ey, was absolutely deprived of all the
benefit of society; the sole end of which is, to 

protect the rights, redress the grievances, and
promote the happiness of individuals. As for
the character of M&wblank;r, he said it was so romantically
singular in all its circumstances, that, tho'
other motives were wanting, curiosity alone
would induce him to seek his acquaintance: but
he did not at all wonder at the ungrateful returns
which had been made to his generosity by H&wblank;n,
and many others, whom he had served in a manner
that few, besides himself, would have done; 
for he had been long convinced of the truth
conveyed in these lines of a celebrated Italian
author: 
Li beneficii, che per la loro grandezza, non
puonno esser guiderdonati, con la scelerata monetadell'
ingratitudine, sono pagati. 
“The story which you have related of that
young gentleman, (said he) bears a very strong
resemblance to the fate of a Spanish nobleman,
as it was communicated to me by one of his own
intimate friends at Paris. The countess d'Alvarez
died immediately after the birth of a son,
and the husband surviving her but three years,
the child was left sole heir to his honours and
estate, under the guardianship of his uncle, who
had a small fortune and a great many children. 
This inhuman relation, coveting the wealth of
his infant ward, formed a design against the life
of the helpless orphan, and trusted the execution
of it to his valet de chambre, who was tempted
to undertake the murder by the promise of a considerable
reward. He accordingly stabbed the
boy with a knife, in three different places, on
the right side of his neck: but, as he was not 

used to such barbarous attempts, his hand failed
in the performance; and he was seized with such
remorse, that, perceiving the wounds were not
mortal, he carried the hapless victim to the house
of a surgeon, by whose care they were healed:
and in the mean time, that he might not forfeit
his recompence, found means to persuade his
employer, that his orders were performed. A
bundle being made up for the purpose, was publickly
interred as the body of the child, who was
said to have been suddenly carried off by a convulsion; 
and the uncle, without opposition, succeeded
to his honours and estate. The boy being
cured of his hurts, was, about the age of six,
delivered, with a small sum of money, to a merchant
just embarking for Turkey; who was given
to understand, that he was the bastard of a man
of quality; and that, for family reasons, it was
necessary to conceal his birth. 
While the unfortunate orphan remained in this
deplorable state of bondage, all the children of
the usurper died one after another; and he himself
being taken dangerously ill, attributed all his
afflictions to the just judgment of God, and communicated
his anxiety on that subject to the
valet de chambre, who had been employed in the
murder of his nephew. That domestic, in order
to quiet his master's conscience, and calm the
perturbation of his spirits, confessed what he had
done, and gave him hopes of still finding the
boy, by dint of industry and expence. The unhappy
child being the only hope of the family of
Alvarez, the uncle immediately ordered a minute
inquiry to be set on foot; in consequence of
which he was informed, that the orphan had been
sold to a Turk, who had afterwards transferred 

him to an English merchant, by whom he was
conveyed to London. 
An express was immediately dispatched to this
capital, where he understood that the unhappy
exile had, in consideration of his faithful services,
been bound apprentice to a French barber-surgeon; 
and after he had sufficiently qualified
himself in that profession, been received into the
family of the count de Gallas, at that time the
emperor's embassador at the court of London. 
From the house of this nobleman, he was traced
into the service of count d'Oberstorf, where he
had married his lady's chamber-maid, and then
gone to settle as a surgeon in Bohemia. 
In the course of these inquiries, several years
elapsed; his uncle, who was very much-attached
to the house of Austria, lived at Barcelona, when
the father of this empress queen resided in that
city, and lent him a very considerable sum of
money in the most pressing emergency of his affairs:
and when that prince was on the point of
returning to Germany, the old count finding his
end approaching, sent his father confessor to his
majesty, with a circumstantial account of the
barbarity he had practised against his nephew,
for which he implored forgiveness, and begg'd he
would give orders, that the orphan, when found,
should inherit the dignities and fortune which he
had unjustly usurped. 
His majesty assured the old man, that he might
make himself easy on that score, and ordered the
confessor to follow him to Vienna, immediately
after the count's death, in order to assist his endeavours
in finding out the injured heir. The
priest did not fail to yield obedience to this command: 

he informed himself of certain natural
marks on the young count's body, which
were known to the nurse and women who attended
him in his infancy; and, with a gentleman
whom the emperor ordered to accompany
him, set out for Bohemia, where he soon found
the object of his inquiry, in the capacity of major
domo to a nobleman of that country, he having
quitted his profession of surgery for that office. 
He was not a little surprized, when he found
himself circumstantially catechised about the particulars
of his life, by persons commissioned for
that purpose by the emperor. He told them,
that he was absolutely ignorant of his own birth,
though he had been informed, during his residence
in Turkey, that he was the bastard of a
Spanish grandee, and gave them a minute detail
of the pilgrimage he had undergone. This information
agreeing with the intelligence which
the priest had already received, and being corroborated
by the marks upon his body, and the very
scars of the wounds which had been inflicted upon
him in his infancy, the confessor, without further
hesitation, saluted him by the name of count
d'Alvarez, grandee of Spain, and explained the
whole mystery of his fortune. 
If he was agreeably amazed at this explanation,
the case was otherwise with his wife, who
thought herself in great danger of being abandoned
by an husband of such high rank; but he
immediately dispelled her apprehension, by assuring
her, that as she had shared in his adversity,
she should also partake of his good fortune. 
He set out immediately for Vienna, to make his
acknowledgements to the emperor, who favoured 

him with a very gracious reception, promised to
use his influence, so that he might enjoy the honours
and estate of his family; and, in the mean
time, acknowledged himself his debtor for four
hundred thousand florins, which he had borrowed
from his uncle. He threw himself at the feet of
his august protector, expressed the most grateful
sense of his goodness, and begg'd he might be
permitted to settle in some of his imperial majesty's
dominions. 
This request was immediately granted; he was
allowed to purchase land in any part of the hereditary
dominions of the house of Austria, to the
amount of the sum I have mentioned; and made
choice of the country of Ratibor in Silesia, where,
in all probability, he still resides.” 
Peregrine had scarce finished this narrative,
when he perceived Mr. M&wblank;r slip something
into the hand of the young man with whom he
had been conversing at the other end of the room,
and rise up from the table, in order to take his
leave. He at once understood the meaning of
this conveyance, and longed for an opportunity
to be acquainted with such a rare instance of primitive
benevolence; but the consciousness of his
present situation hindered him from making any
advance, that might be construed into forwardness
or presumption.
