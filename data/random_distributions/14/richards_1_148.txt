Miss Howe, To Miss Clarissa Harlowe. 

Sat. April 22. 
I cannot for my life account for your wretch's teazing
ways. But he certainly doubts your Love of him. 
In this He is a modest man, as well as somebody else; 
and tacitly confesses, that he does not deserve it. 
Your Israelitish hankerings after the Egyptian onions
(testified still more in your Letter to your Aunt); 
Your often-repeated regrets for meeting him; for being
betrayed away by him—These he cannot bear. 
I have been looking back on the whole of his conduct,
and comparing it with his general character; 
and find, that he is more consistently, more uniformly,
mean, revengeful, and proud, than either of us once
imagined. 
From his cradle, as I may say, as an only child, and
a boy, humoursome, spoiled, mischievous; the governor
of his governors. 
A Libertine in his riper years, hardly regardful of
appearances; and despising the Sex in general, for the
faults of particulars of it, who made themselves too
cheap to him. 
What has been his behaviour in your family, a
Clarissa in view (from the time your foolish Brother
was obliged to take a life from him) but defiance
for defiances? —Getting you into his power by terror, 

by artifice. What politeness can be expected from
such a man? 
Well, but what in such a situation is to be done? 
Why, you must despise him: You must hate him— 
if you can—and run away from him—But whither? 
Whither indeed, now that your Brother is laying foolish
plots to put you in a still worse condition, as it may
happen? 
But if you cannot despise and hate him; if you care
not to break with him; you must part with some
punctilio's: And if the so doing bring not on the Solemnity,
you must put yourself into the protection of
the Ladies of his family. 
Their respect for you is of itself a security for his
honour to you, if there could be any room for doubt. 
And at least you should remind him of his offer to bring
one of the Miss Montague's to attend you at your new
lodgings in town, and accompany you, till all is happily
over. 
This, you'll say, will be as good as declaring yourself
to be his. And so let it. You ought not now to
think of any-thing else but to be his. Does not your
Brother's project convince you more and more of this? 
Give over then, my dearest friend, any thoughts of
this hopeless Reconciliation, which has kept you balancing
thus long. You own, in the Letter before me, that
he made very explicit offers, tho' you give me not the
very words. And he gave his reasons, I perceive, with
his wishes, that you should accept them: Which very
few of the sorry fellows do; whose plea is generally but
a compliment to our Self-love—That we must love them,
however presumptuous and unworthy, because they
love us. 
Were I in your place, and had your charming delicacies,
I should, perhaps, do as you do. No doubt
but I should expect that the man should urge me with
respectful warmth; that he should supplicate with constancy,
and that all his words and actions should tend to 

the one principal point—Nevertheless, if I suspected
art or delay, founded upon his doubts of my Love, I
would either condescend to clear up his doubts, or renounce
him for ever. 
And in this last case, I, your Anna Howe, would
exert myself, and either find you a private refuge, or
resolve to share fortunes with you. 
What a wretch, to be so easily answered by your
reference to the arrival of your Cousin Morden! But
I am afraid that you was too scrupulous: —For did he
not resent that reference? 
Could we have his account of the matter, I fansy,
my dear, I should think you over-nice, over-delicate (a) . 
Had you laid hold of his acknowleged explicitness, he
would have been as much in your power, as now you
seem to be in his—You wanted not to be told, that
the person who had been tricked into such a step as you
had taken, must of necessity submit to many mortifications. 
But were it to me, a girl of spirit as I am thought to
be, I do assure you, I would in a quarter of an hour (all
the time I would allow to punctilio in such a case as
yours) know what he drives at: Since either he must
mean well or ill. If ill, the sooner you know it, the
better. If well, whose modesty is it he distresses, but
that of his own wise? 
And methinks you should endeavour to avoid all
exasperating recriminations, as to what you have heard
of his failure in morals; especially while you are so
happy, as not to have occasion to speak of them by experience. 
I grant, that it gives a worthy mind some satisfaction
in having borne its testimony against the immoralities
of a bad one. But that correction which is unseasonably 

given, is more likely either to harden or make an hypocrite,
than to reclaim. 
I am pleased, however, as well as you, with his
making light of your Brother's wise project. —Poor
creature! and must Master Jemmy Harlowe, with his
half-wit, pretend to plot, and contrive mischief, yet
rail at Lovelace for the same things? —A witty villain
deserves hanging at once (and without ceremony, if
you please); but a half-witted one deserves broken
bones first, and hanging afterwards. I think Lovelace
has given his character in few words (a) . 
Be angry at me, if you please; but as sure as you
are alive, now that this poor creature, whom some call
your Brother, finds he has succeeded in making you fly
your Father's house, and that he has nothing to fear
but your getting into your own, and into an independence
of him, he thinks himself equal to any-thing, and
so has a mind to fight Lovelace with his own weapons. 
Don't you remember his pragmatical triumph, as
told you by your Aunt, and prided in by that saucy
Betty Barnes, from his own foolish mouth (b) ? 
I expect nothing from your Letter to your Aunt. I
hope Lovelace will never know the contents of it. In
every one of yours, I see that he as warmly resents as
he dares, the little confidence you have in him. I
should resent it too, were I he; and knew I deserved
better. 
Don't be scrupulous about cloaths, if you think of
putting yourself into the protection of the Ladies of
his family. They know how matters stand between
you and your relations, and love you never the worse
for the silly peoples cruelty. 
I know you won't demand possession of your Estate. 
But give him a right to demand it for you; and that
will be still better. 

Adieu, my dear! May Heaven guide and direct you
in all your steps, is the daily prayer of 
Your ever-affectionate and faithful
Anna Howe.
