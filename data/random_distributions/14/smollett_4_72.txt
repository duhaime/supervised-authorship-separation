My father makes a present to Narcissa—the
letter is dispatched to her brother—I appear
among my acquaintance—Banter's
behaviour—the Squire refuses his consent— 
my uncle comes to town—approves of
my choice—I am married—we meet the
Squire and his lady at the play—our acquaintance
is courted. 
After having spent the evening to the
satisfaction of all present, my father addressed
himself thus to Narcissa, “Madam, give me
leave to consider you hereafter as my daughter,
in which capacity I insist upon your accepting
this first instance of my paternal duty and affection.” 
With these words, he put into her
hand a bank-note for 500l. which she no sooner
examined, than with a low curtesy she replied,
“Dear Sir, tho' I have not the least occasion
for this supply, I have too great a veneration
for you, to refuse this proof of your generosity
and esteem, which I the more freely receive, because
I already look upon Mr. Random's interest
as inseparably connected with mine.” He
was extremely well pleased at her frank and ingenuous
reply, upon which we saluted, and
wished her good night. —The letter, at my request,
was dispatched to Sussex by an express, and in 

the mean time, Don Rodriguez, to grace my
nuptials, hired a ready-furnished house, and set
up a very handsom equipage. 
Though I passed the greatest part of the day
with the darling of my soul, I found leisure
sometimes to be among my former acquaintance,
who were astonished at the magnificence of my
appearance: Banter in particular was confounded
at the strange vicissitudes of my fortune, the causes
of which he endeavoured in vain to discover, until
I thought fit to disclose the whole secret of my
last voyage, partly in consideration of our former
intimacy, and partly to prevent unfavourable
conjectures which he and others, in all probability,
would have made in regard to my circumstances. 
He professed great satisfaction at this piece of
news, and I had no cause to believe him insincere,
when I considered that he would now look
upon himself as acquitted of the debt he owed
me, and at the same time flatter himself with
hopes of borrowing more. —I carried him
home to dinner with me, and my father liked
his conversation so much, that upon hearing his
difficulties, he desired me to accommodate him
for the present, and enquire if he would accept
of a commission in the army, towards the purchase
of which he would willingly lend him
money. Accordingly, I gave my friend an opportunity
of being alone with me, when, as I
expected, he told me that he was just on the
point of being reconciled to an old rich uncle,
whose heir he was, but wanted a few pieces for
immediate expence, which he desired I would
lend him, and take his bond for the whole. 
His demand was limited to ten guineas; and 

when I put twenty into his hand, he stared at
me for some moments, then putting it into his
purse, said, “Ay, 'tis all one,—you'll have the
whole in a very short time.” When I had
taken his note, to save the expence of a bond,
I expressed some surprize that a fellow of his spirit
should loiter away his time in idleness, and
asked why he did not choose to make his fortune
in the army. —“What! (said he) throw away
money upon a subaltern's commission, to be
under the command of a parcel of scoundrels
who have raised themselves above me by the
most infamous practices! no, I love independency
too well to sacrifice my life, health and
pleasure for such a pitiful consideration.” 
—Finding him averse to this way of life, I chang'd
the subject, and return'd to Don Rodriguez, who
had just received the following epistle from the
Squire. 

SIR,
“Concerning a letter which I received, subscrib'd
R. Random, this is the answer. — 
As for you, I know nothing of you. —Your
son, or pretended son, I have seen;—if he marries
my sister, at his peril be it; I do declare,
that he shall not have one farthing of her fortune,
which becomes my property, if she
takes a husband without my consent. —Your
settlement, I do believe, is all a sham, and
yourself no better than you should be; but if
you had all the wealth of the Indies, your
son shall never match in our family, with the
consent of 
“Orson Topehall.” 

My father was not much surprised at this polite
letter, after having heard the character of the
author: and as for me, I was even pleased at
his refusal, because I now had an opportunity of
shewing my disinterested love. By his permission
I waited on my charmer; and having imparted
the contents of her brother's letter, at
which she wept bitterly, in spite of all my consolation
and caresses, the time of our marriage
was fixed at the distance of two days. —During
this interval, in which my soul was wound up
to the last stretch of rapturous expectation, Narcissa
endeavoured to reconcile some of her relations
in town to her marriage with me; but finding
them all deaf to her remonstrances, either out
of envy or prejudice; she told me with the most
enchanting sweetness, while the tears bedewed
her lovely cheeks, “Sure the world will no
longer question your generosity, when you take
a poor forlorn beggar to your arms.” Affected
with her sorrow, I pressed the fair mourner to my
breast, and swore that she was more dear and
welcome on that account, because she had sacrificed
her friends and fortune to her love for me. 
—My uncle, for whose character she had a great
veneration, being by this time come to town, I
introduced him to my bride; and although he was
not very much subject to refined sensations, he
was struck dumb with admiration at her beauty. 
After having kissed and gazed at her for some
time, he turned to me, saying, “Odds bobs,
Rory! here's a notable prize indeed, finely
built and gloriously rigged, I faith! if she an't
well manned when you have the command of
of her, sirrah, you deserve to go to sea in 

a cockle-shell. —No offence, I hope, niece; 
you must not mind what I say, being (as the
saying is) a plain sea-faring man, thof mayhap
I have as much regard for you as another.” 
—She received him with great civility, told him
she had longed a great while to see a person to
whom she was so much indebted for his generosity
to Mr. Random, that she looked upon him
as her uncle, by which name she begged leave to
call him for the future, and that she was very sure
he could say nothing that could give her the least
offence. The honest captain was transported at
her courteous behaviour, and insisted upon giving
her away at the ceremony, swearing that he loved
her as well as if she was his own child, and that
he would give two thousand guineas to the first
fruit of our love, as soon as it could squeak. 
—Every thing being prepared for the solemnization
of our nuptials, which were to be performed privately
at my father's house, the auspicious hour
arrived, when Don Rodriguez and my uncle
went in the coach to fetch the bride and Miss
Williams; leaving me with a parson, Banter and
Strap, neither of whom had as yet seen my
charming mistress. —My faithful valet, who was
on the rack of impatience to behold a lady of whom
he had heard so much, no sooner understood that
the coach was returned, than he placed himself at
a window to have a peep at her as she alighted; 
and when he saw her, he clapped his hands together,
turned up the white of his eyes, and
with his mouth wide open, remained in a sort of
extasy, which broke out into, “O Dea certe!— 
qualis in Eurotæ ripis, aut per juga Cynthi exercet
Diana choros!” —The doctor and Banter were 

surpriz'd to hear my man speak Latin, but when
my father led Narcissa into the room, the object
of their admiration was soon changed, as appear'd
in the countenances of both. —Indeed they must
have been the most insensible of all beings, could
they have beheld without emotion the divine
creature that approached! She was dressed in a
sack of white sattin, embroidered on the breast
with gold; the crown of her head was covered
with a small French cap, from whence descended
her beautiful hair in ringlets that waved upon her
snowy neck, which dignified the necklace I had
given her; her looks glowed with modesty and
love; and her bosom, thro' the veil of gauze that
shaded it, afforded a prospect of Elyzium! —I received
this inestimable gift of providence as became
me; and in a little time the clergyman did
his office, my uncle, at his own earnest request,
acting the part of a father to my dear Narcissa,
who trembled very much, and had scarce spirits
sufficient to support her under this great change
of situation. —Soon as she was mine by the laws
of heaven and earth, I printed a burning kiss upon
her lips, my father embraced her tenderly, my
uncle hugged her with great affection, and I presented
her to my friend Banter, who saluted her
in a very polite manner; Miss Williams hung
round her neck, and wept plentifully; while Strap
fell upon his knees, and begged to kiss his lady's
hand, which she presented with great affability. 
—I shall not pretend to describe my own feelings
at this juncture; let it suffice to say, that after
having supped and entertained ourselves 'till ten
a-clock, I cautioned my Narcissa against exposing
her health by sitting up too late, and she 

was prevailed upon to withdraw with her maid to
an apartment destin'd for us. When she left
the room, her face was overspread with a blush
that set all my blood in a state of fermentation,
and made every pulse beat with tenfold
vigour! She was so cruel as to let me remain in
this condition a full half hour; when, no longer
able to restrain my impatience, I broke from the
company, burst into her chamber, pushed out
her confidante, locked the door, and found her
—O heav'n and earth! a feast, a thousand
times more delicious than my most sanguine
hope presaged! —But let me not profane the chaste
mysteries of hymen—I was the happiest of
men! 
In the morning I was awaked by three or four
drums, which Banter had placed under the window; 
upon which I withdrew the curtain, and
enjoyed the unspeakable satisfaction of contemplating
those angelic charms, which were now in
my possession! Beauty! which whether sleeping or
awake, shot forth peculiar graces! —The light
darting upon my Narcissa's eyes, she awoke also,
and recollecting her situation, hid her blushes in
my bosom. —I was distracted with joy! I could
not believe the evidence of my senses, and looked
upon all that had happened, as the fictions of a
dream! In the mean time my uncle knocked
at the door, and bid me turn out, for I had had
a long spell. —I got up accordingly, and sent
Miss Williams to her mistress, myself receiving
the congratulation of captain Bowling, who rallied
me in his sea phrase, with great success. —In
less than an hour, Don Rodriguez led my wife in
to breakfast, where she received the compliments 

of the company on her looks, which, they said,
if possible, were improved by matrimony. 
—As her delicate ears were offended with none of
those indecent ambiguities, which are too often
spoke on such occasions, she behaved with dignity,
unaffected modesty, and ease; and as a
testimony of my affection and esteem, I presented
her, in presence of them all, with a deed, by
which I settled the whole fortune I was possessed
of, on her and her heirs for ever. —She accepted
it with a glance of most tender acknowledgment,
observed, that she could not be surprized at any
thing of this kind I should do, and desired my
father to take the trouble of keeping it, saying,
“Next to my own Mr. Random, you are the person
in whom I ought to have the greatest confidence.” 
Charm'd with her prudent and ingenuous
manner of proceeding, he took the paper,
and assured her that it should not lose its value
while in his custody. 
As we had not many visits to give and receive; 
the little time we stayed in town was spent
in going to publick diversions, where I have the
vanity to think Narcissa seldom was eclipsed. —One
night in particular, we had sent our footman
to keep one of the stage-boxes, which we no
sooner entered, than we perceived in the opposite
box the Squire and his lady, who seem'd not
a little surprised at seeing us. I was pleased at
this opportunity of confronting them; the more,
because Melinda was robbed of all her admirers by
my wife, who happened that night to outshine
her sister both in beauty and dress. She was
piqued at Narcissa's victory, tossed her head a
thousand different ways, flirted her fan, looked 

at us with disdain, then whispered to her husband,
and broke out into an affected giggle; but all her
arts proved ineffectual, either to discompose Mrs.
Random, or to conceal her own mortification,
which at length forced her away long before
the play was done. —The news of our marriage
being spread, with many circumstances to our
disadvantage, by the industry of this malignant
creature, a certain set of persons, fond of scandal,
began to enquire into the particulars of my fortune,
which they no sooner understood to be independant,
than the tables were turned, and our
acquaintance was courted as much as it had been
despised before: But Narcissa had too much dignity
of pride, to encourage this change of conduct,
especially in her relations, whom she
could never be prevailed upon to see, after the
malicious reports they had raised to her prejudice.
