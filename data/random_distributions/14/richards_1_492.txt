Mr. Lovelace, To John Belford, Esq; 

Curse upon the Colonel, and curse upon the
writer of the last Letter I received, and upon all
the world! Thou to pretend to be as much interested
in my Clarissa's fate as myself! 'Tis well for one of
us, that this was not said to me, instead of written— 
Living or dying, she is mine—and only mine. Have
I not earned her dearly? —Is not Damnation likely to
be the purchase to me, tho' a happy Eternity will be
hers? 
An eternal separation! O God! O God! —How
can I bear that thought! —But yet there is Life! — 
Yet, therefore, Hope—Enlarge my Hope, and thou
shalt be my good genius, and I will forgive thee everything. 
For this last time—But it must not, shall not, be 

the last—Let me hear, the moment thou receivest
this—what I am to be—For, at present, I am 
The most miserable of Men. 
Rose at Knightsbridge, 5 o'Clock. 
My fellow tells me, that thou art sending Mowbray
and Tourville to me. I want them not. 
My soul's sick of them, and of all the world; but
most of myself. Yet, as they send me word
they will come to me immediately, I will wait
for them, and for thy next. O Belford! let it
not be—But hasten it, hasten it, be what it
may!
