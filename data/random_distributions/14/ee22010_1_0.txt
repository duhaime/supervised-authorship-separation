Wiseman.
Good morrow my good
Neighbour, Mr. Attentive;
whither are you walking
so early this morning? methinks
you look as if you were concerned
about something more than ordinary.
Have you lost any of your
Cattel, or what is the matter?
Attentive. Good Sir, Good morrow
to you, I have not as yet lost ought,
but yet you give a right ghess of me,
for I am, as you say, concerned in my
heart, but 'tis because of the badness of
the times. And Sir, you, as all our

Neighbours know, are a very observing
man, pray therefore what do you
think of them?
Wise. Why? I think, as you
say, to wit, that they are bad times,
and bad they will be, untill men are
better: for they are bad men that
make bad times; if men therefore
would mend, so would the times.
'Tis a folly to look for good dayes,
so long as sin is so high, and those
that study its nourishment so many.
God bring it down, and those that
nourish it to Repentance, and then
my good Neighbour, you will be
concerned, not as you are now:
Now you are concerned because
times are so bad; but then you will
be so, 'cause times are so good:
Now you are concerned so as to be
perplexed, but then you will be concerned
so as to lift up your voice
with shouting; for I dare say, could
you see such dayes they would make
you shout.
Atten. Ai, so they would, such
times I have prayed for, such times
I have longed for: but I fear they'l
be worse before they be better.
Wise. Make no Conclusions, man:

for he that hath the hearts of men
in his hand, can change them from
worse to better, and so bad times
into good. God give long life to
them that are good, and especially
to those of them that are capable of
doing him service in the world. The
Ornament and Beauty of this lower
World, next to God and his Wonders,
are the men that spangle and
shine in godliness.
Now as Mr. Wiseman said this,
he gave a great sigh.
Atten. Amen. Amen. But why,
good Sir, do you sigh so deeply? is it
for ought else than that for the which
as you have perceived, I my self am
concerned?
Wise. I am concerned with you,
for the badness of the times; but
that was not the cause of that sigh,
of the which, as I see, you take notice.
I sighed at the remembrance
of the death of that man for whom
the Bell tolled at our Town yesterday.
Atten. Why? I trow, Mr. Goodman
your Neighbour is not dead. Indeed
I did hear that he had been sick.
Wise. No, no, it is not he. Had

it been he, I could not but have
been concerned, but yet not as I
am concerned now. If he had died,
I should only have been concerned
for that the world had lost a Light:
but the man that I am concerned for
now, was one that never was good,
therefore such an one who is not
dead only, but damned. He died
that he might die, he went from
Life to Death, and then from Death
to Death, from Death Natural to
death Eternal. And as he spake this,
the water stood in his eyes.
Atten. Indeed, to goe from a
death-bed to Hell is a fearful thing
to think on. But good Neighbour
Wiseman, be pleased to tell me who
this man was, and why you conclude
him so miserable in his death?
Wise. Well, if you can stay, I
will tell you who he was, and why
I conclude thus concerning him.
Atten. My leisure will admit me
to stay, and I am willing to hear you
out. And I pray God your discourse
may take hold on my heart, that I may
be bettered thereby. So they agreed
to sit down under a tree: Then Mr.
Wiseman proceeded as followeth.

Wise. The man that I mean, is
one Mr. Badman; he has lived in
our Town a great while, and now,
as I said, he is dead. But the reason
of my being so concerned at
his death, is, not for that he was at
all related to me, or for that any
good conditions died with him, for
he was far from them, but for that,
as I greatly fear, he hath, as was
hinted before, died two deaths at
once.
Atten. I perceive what you mean
by two deaths at once; and to speak
truth, 'tis a fearfull thing thus to
have ground to think of any: for
although the death of the ungodly
and sinners is laid to heart but of
few, yet to die in such a state, is
more dreadful and fearful than any
man can imagine. Indeed if a man
had no Soul, if his state was not
truely Immortal, the matter would
not be so much; but for a man to be
so disposed of by his Maker, as to be
appointed a sensible being for ever,
and for him too to fall into the hands
of revenging Justice, that will be
always, to the utmost extremity that
his sin deserveth, punishing of him

in the dismal dungeon of Hell, this
must needs be unutterably sad, and
lamentable.
Wise. There is no man, I think,
that is sensible of the worth of one
Soul, but must, when he hears of
the death of unconverted men, be
stricken with sorrow and grief: because,
as you said well, that mans
state is such, that he has a sensible
being for ever. For 'tis sense that
makes punishment heavy. But yet
sense is not all that the Damned have,
they have sense and reason too; so
then, as Sense receiveth punishment
with sorrow because it feels, and
bleeds under the same, so by Reason,
and the exercise thereof, in the
midst of torment, all present Affliction
is aggravated, and that three
manner of wayes:
1. Reason will consider thus with
himself; For what am I thus tormented?
and will easily find 'tis for
nothing but that base and filthy
thing, Sin; and now will Vexation
be mixed with Punishment, and
that will greatly heighten the Affliction.
2. Reason will consider thus with

himself. How long must this be my
state? And will soon return to himself
this Answer: This must be my
state for ever and ever. Now this
will greatly increase the torment.
3. Reason will consider thus with
himself; What have I lost more
than present ease and quiet by my
sins that I have committed? And
will quickly return himself this answer:
I have lost Communion with
God, Christ, Saints and Angels,
and a share in Heaven and eternal
Life: And this also must needs greaten
the misery of poor damned
souls. And this is the case of Mr.
Badman.
Atten. I feel my heart even shake
at the thoughts of coming into such a
state. Hell! who knows that is yet
alive, what the torments of Hell are?
This word Hell gives a very dreadful
sound.
Wise. Ai, so it does in the ears of
him that has a tender Conscience.
But if, as you say, and that truly,
the very Name of Hell, is so dreadful,
what is the Place it self, and
what are the Punishments that are
there inflicted, and that without the

least intermission, upon the Souls of
damned men, for ever and ever.
Atten. Well, but passing this; my
leisure will admit me to stay, and
therefore pray tell me what it is that
makes you think that Mr. Badman
is gone to Hell.
Wise. I will tell you. But first do
you know which of the Badmans
I mean?
Atten. Why was there more of
them than one?
Wise. O, yes, a great many, both
Brothers and Sisters, and yet all of
them the Children of a godly Parent,
the more a great deal is the
pity.
Atten. Which of them therefore
was it that died.
Wise. The eldest, old in years,
and old in sin; but the sinner that
dies an hundred years old shall be accursed.
Atten. Well, but what makes you
think he is gone to Hell?
Wise. His wicked life, and fearful
death, specially since the Manner
of his death was so corresponding
with his life.
Atten. Pray let me know the manner

of his death, if your self did perfectly
know it.
Wise. I was there when he died:
But I desire not to see another such
man (while I live) die in such sort
as he did.
Atten. Pray therefore let me hear
it.
Wise. You say you have leisure
and can stay, and therefore, if you
please, we will discourse even orderly
of him. First, we will begin
with his Life, and then proceed to
his Death: Because a relation of the
first may the more affect you, when
you shall hear of the second.
Atten. Did you then so well know
his Life?
Wise. I knew him of a Child.
I was a man, when he was but a
boy, and I made special observation
of him from first to last.
Atten. Pray then let me hear from
you an account of his Life; but be as
brief as you can, for I long to hear of
the manner of his death.
Wise. I will endeavour to answer
your desires, and first, I will
tell you, that from a Child he was
very bad: his very beginning was

ominous, and presaged that no good
end, was, in likelyhood, to follow
thereupon. There were several sins
that he was given to, when but a
little one, that manifested him to
be notoriously infected with Orginal
corruption; for I dare say he
learned none of them of his Father
or Mother; nor was he admitted
to go much abroad among other
Children, that were vile, to learn
to sin of them: Nay, contrariwise,
if at any time he did get abroad
amongst others, he would be as the
Inventer of bad words, and an example
in bad actions. To them all
he used to be, as we say, the Ring-leader,
and Master-sinner from a
Childe.
Atten. This was a bad Beginning
indeed, and did demonstrate that he
was, as you say, polluted, very much
polluted with Original Corruption.
For to speak my mind freely, I do
confess, that it is mine opinion, that
Children come polluted with sin into
the World,Original sin is the root of Actual transgressions. and that oft-times the
sins of their youth, especially while
they are very young, are rather by vertue
of Indwelling sin, than by examples

that are set before them by others.
Not but that they learn to sin by example
too, but Example is not the
root, but rather the Temptation unto
wickedness. The root is sin within;
for from within,  out of the heart
of man proceedeth sin.
Wise. I am glad to hear that you
are of this opinion, and to confirm
what you have said by a few hints
from the Word.  Man in his birth
is compared to an Ass, (an unclean
Beast) and to a wretched Infant in
its blood: besides,  all the first-born
of old that were offered unto the
Lord,  were to be redeemed at the
age of a month, and that was before
they were sinners by imitation.
The Scripture also affirmeth,
that by the sin of one,  Judgement
came upon all; and renders this reason,
for that all have sinned: nor
is that Objection worth a rush, That
Christ by his death hath taken away
Original Sin. First, Because it is
Scriptureless. Secondly, Because it
makes them incapable of Salvation
by Christ; for none but those that
in their own Persons are sinners, are
to have Salvation by him. Many

other things might be added, but
between persons so well agreed as
you and I are, these may suffice at
present: but when an Antagonist
comes to deal with us about this
matter, then we have for him often
other strong Arguments, if he be an
Antagonist worth the taking notice
of.
Atten. But, as was hinted before,
he used to be the Ring-leading Sinner,
or the Master of mischief among other
children; yet these are but Generals;
pray therefore tell me in Particular
which were the sins of his Childhood.
Wise. I will so. When he was
but a Child, he was so addicted to
*Badman addicted to Lying from a child. Lying, that his Parents scarce
knew when to believe he spake
true; yea, he would invent, tell,
and stand to the Lyes that he invented
and told, and that with such
an audacious face, that one might
even read in his very countenance
the symptoms of an hard and desperate
heart this way.
Atten. This was an ill beginning
indeed, and argueth that he began to
harden himself in sin betimes. For a
lye cannot be knowingly told and stood

in, (and I perceive that this was his
manner of way in Lying) but he
must as it were force his own heart
unto it. Yea, he must make his
*A Lie knowingly told demonstrates that the heart is desperately hard. heart hard, and bold to doe it:
Yea, he must be arrived to an exceeding
pitch of wickedness thus to
doe, since all this he did against that
good education, that before you seemed
to hint, he had from his Father
and Mother.
Wise. The want of good Education,
as you have intimated, is
many times a cause why Children
doe so easily, so soon, become bad;
especially when there is not only a
want of that, but bad Examples
enough, as, the more is the pity,
there is in many Families; by vertue
of which poor Children are
trained up in Sin, and nursed therein
for the Devil and Hell. But it
was otherwise with Mr. Badman,
for to my knowledge, this his way
of Lying, was a great grief to his
Parents, for their hearts were much
dejected at this beginning of their
Son; nor did there want Counsel
and Correction from them to him,
if that would have made him better,

He wanted not to be told,The Lyers portion. in my
hearing, and that over and over and
over,  That all Lyars should have
their part in the Lake that burns
with fire and brimstone; and that
whosoever loveth and maketh a lye,
should not have any part in the
new and heavenly Jerusalem: But
all availed nothing with him; when
a fit, or an occasion to lie, came
upon him, he would invent, tell, and
stand to his Lie (as steadfastly as
if it had been the biggest of truths,)
that he told, and that with that hardening
of his heart and face, that it
would be to those that stood by, a
wonder. Nay, and this he would
doe when under the rod of correction
which is appointed by God for
Parents to use,  that thereby they
might keep their Children from
Hell.
Atten. Truly it was, as I said, a
bad beginning, he served the Devil
betimes; yea he became a Nurse to
one of his †  Brats, for a spirit of Lying
is the Devils Brat, *The Devils Brat. for he is a
Liar and the Father of it.
Wise. Right, he is the Father
of it indeed. A Lie is begot by the

Devil, as the Father, and is brought
forth by the wicked heart, as the
Mother: wherefore another Scripture
also saith,  Why hath Satan filled
thy heart to lye, &c. Yea, he
calleth the heart that is big with a
lye, an heart that hath Conceived,
that is, by the Devil. Why hast thou
conceived this thing in thy heart, thou
hast not lied unto men, but unto God.
True, his lye was a lye of the highest
nature, but every lye hath the
*The Father and Mother of a Lie. same Father and Mother as had
the lie last spoken of. For he is a
lier, and the Father of it. A lie then
is the Brat of Hell, and it cannot
†  be in the heart before the person
has committed a kind of spiritual
Adultery with the Devil. That
Soul therefore that telleth a known
lie, has lien with, and conceived it
by lying with the Devil, the only
Father of lies. For a lie has only
one Father and Mother, the Devil
and the Heart. No marvel therefore
if the hearts that hatch and
bring forth Lies, be so much of
complexion with the Devil. Yea,
no marvel though God and Christ
have so bent their Word against

lyers: a lyer is weded to the Devil
himself.
Atten. It seems a marvellous thing
in mine eyes, that since a lye is the Offspring
of the devill, and since a lye
brings the soul to the very den of Devils,
to wit, the dark dungeon of hell;
that men should be so desperately wicked
as to accustom themselves to so
horrible a thing.
Wise. It seems also marvellous to
me, specially when I observe for how
little a matter some men will study,
contrive, make and tell a lye. You
shall have some that will lye it over
and over, and that for a peny *Some will tell a Lie for a Peny profit. profit.
Yea, lye and stand in it, although
they know that they lye: yea, you
shall have some men that will not
stick to tell lye after lye, though
themselves get nothing thereby;
They will tell lyes in their ordinary
discourse with their Neighbours, also
their News, their Jests, and their
Tales must needs be adorned with
lyes; or else they seem to bear no
good sound to the ear, nor shew
much to the fancie of him to whom
they are told. But alas, what will
these lyers doe, when, for their lyes

they shall be tumbled down into
hell, to that Devil that did beget
those lyes in their heart, and so be
tormented by fire and brimstone,
with him, and that for ever and ever,
for their lyes?
Atten. Can you not give one some
example of Gods Judgements upon
lyers, that one may tell them to lyers
when one hears them lye, if perhaps
they may by the hearing thereof, be
made afraid, and ashamed to lye.
Wise. Examples! why, *An Example for Lyers. Saphira
and his wife are examples enough
to put a stop, one would think, to a
spirit addicted thereto, for they both
were stricken down dead for telling 
a lye, and that by God himself,
in the midst of a company of people.
But if Gods threatning of Liers with
Hell-fire, and with the loss of the
Kingdom of Heaven, will not prevail
with them to leave off to lie
and make lies, it cannot be imagined
that a relation of temporal
Judgements that have swept liers
out of the World heretofore, should
do it. Now, as I said, this Lying
was one of the first sins that Mr. Badman
was addicted to, and he could

make them and tell them fearfully.
Atten. I am sorry to hear this of
him, and so much the more because,
as I fear, this sin did not reign in
him *A Spirit of Lying accompanyed with other sins. alone; for usually one that is
accustomed to lying, is also accustomed
to other evils besides, and if it
were not so also with Mr. Badman,
it would be indeed a wonder.
Wise. You say true, the lier is
a Captive slave of more than the
spirit of lying: and therefore this
Mr. Badman, as he was a lier from
a Child, so he was also much given
to *Badman given to pilfer. pilfer and steal, so that what
he could, as we say, handsomly lay
his hands on, that was counted his
own, whether they were the things
of his fellow Children; or if he
could lay hold of any thing at a
Neighbours house, he would take
it away; you must understand me
of Trifles; for being yet but a Child
he attempted no great matter, especially
at first. But yet as he grew
up in strength and ripeness of wit
so he attempted to pilfer and steal
things still of more value than a
first. He took at last great pleasure

in robbing of Gardens and Orchards;
and as he grew up, to steal
Pullen from the Neighbourhood:
Yea, what was his *Badman would rob his Father. Fathers, could
not escape his fingers, all was Fish
that came to his Net, so hardened, at
last, was he in this mischief also.
Atten. You make me wonder more
and more. What, play the Thief too!
What play the Thief so soon! He
could not but know, though he was
but a Child, that what he took from
others, was none of his own. Besides,
if his Father was a good man, as
you say, it could not be, but he must
also hear from him, that to steal was
to transgress the Law of God, and so
to run the hazard of eternal Damnation.
Wise. His Father was not wanting
to use the means to reclaim
him; often urging, as I have been
told, that saying in the Law of Moses, 
Thou shalt not steal: And also
that,  This is the Curse that goeth
forth over the face of the whole
earth, for every one that stealeth
shall be cut off, &c. The light of
Nature also, though he was little,
must needs shew him that what he

took from others, was not his own,
and that he would not willingly
have been served so himself. But all
was to no purpose, let Father and
Conscience say what they would to
him, he would go on, he was resolved
to go on in his wickedness.
Atten. But his Father would, as
you intimate, sometimes rebuke him
for his wickedness; pray how would
he carry it then?
Wise.  How! why, like to a Thief
that is found. He would stand
*How Badman did use to carry it when his Father used to chide him for his sins. gloating, and hanging down his
head in a sullen, pouching manner,
(a body might read, as we use to
say, the picture of Ill-luck in his
face,) and when his Father did demand
his answer to such questions
concerning his Villany, he would
grumble and mutter at him, and that
should be all he could get.
Atten. But you said that he would
also rob his Father, methinks that was
an unnatural thing.
Wise. Natural or unnatural, all is
one to a Thief. Besides, you must
think that he had likewise Companions
to whom he was, for the wickedness
that he saw in them, more

*Badman more firmly knit to his Companions than either to Father or Mother. firmly knit, than either to Father
or Mother. Yea, and what had he
cared if Father and Mother had died
for grief for him. Their death
would have been, as he would have
counted, great release and liberty
to him: For the truth is, they and
their counsel was his Bondage; yea,
and if I forget not, I have heard
some say, that when he was, at
times, among his Companions, he
would greatly †Badman would rejoyce to think that his Parents death were at hand. rejoyce to think that
his Parents were old, and could not
live long, and then, quoth he, I
shall be mine own man, to do what
I list without their controul.
Atten. Then it seems he counted
that robbing of his Parents was no
crime.
Wise. None at all, and therefore
he fell directly under that Sentence,
Whoso robbeth his Father or his Mother, 
and saith it is no transgression,
the same is the companion of a destroyer.
And for that he set so light
by them as to their Persons and
Counsels, 'twas a sign that at present
he was of a very abominable
spirit, *1 Sam. 2. 25. and that some Judgement
waited to take hold of him in time
to come.

Atten. But can you imagin what
it was, I mean, in his conceit (for I
speak not now of the suggestions of
Satan, by which doubtless he was put
on to do these things,) I say what it
should be in his conceit, that should
make him think that this his manner
of pilfering and stealing was no great
matter.
Wise. It was, for that, the thing,
that he stole, were small; to rob
Orchards, and Gardens, and to steal
Pullen, and the like, these he counted
*Badman counted his thieving no great matter.
Tricks of Youth, nor would
he be beat out of it by all that his
Friends could say. They would tell
him that he must not covet, or desire,
(and yet to desire, is less than
to take) even any thing, the least
thing that was his Neighbours, and
that if he did, it would be a transgression
of the Law; but all was
one to him: what through the wicked
Talk of his Companions, and
the delusion of his own corrupt
heart, he would go on in his pilfering
course, and where he thought
himself secure, would talk of, and
laugh at it when he had done.
Atten. Well, I heard a man once,

when he was upon the Ladder with
the Rope about his Neck, confess
(when ready to be turned off by the
Hangman) that that which had
brought him to that end, was his accustoming
of himself, when young, to
pilfer and steal small things. To my
best remembrance he told us, that he
began the trade of a Thief by stealing
of Pins and Points, and therefore
did forewarn all the Youth, that
then were gathered together to see
him die, to take heed of beginning,
though but with little sins, because
by tampering at first with little ones,
way is made for the commission of
bigger.
Wise.The Story of old Tod. Since you are entred upon
Storyes, I also will tell you one,
the which, though I heard it not
with mine own Ears, yet my Author
I dare believe: *Young Thieves take notice. It is concerning
one old Tod, that was hanged
about Twenty years agoe, or more,
at Hartford, for being a Thief.
The Story is this:
At a Summer Assizes holden at
Hartfort, while the Judge was sitting
upon the Bench, comes this
old Tod into the Court, cloathed in

a green Suit, with his Leathern Girdle
in his hand, his Bosom open,
and all on a dung sweat, as if he
had run for his Life; and being
come in, he spake aloud as follows:
*Old Tod began his way to the Gallows by robbing of Orchards and the like. My Lord, said he, Here is the
veryest Rogue that breaths upon the
face of the earth. I have been a
Thief from a Child: When I was but
a little one, I gave my self to rob
Orchards, and to do other such like
wicked things, and I have continued
a Thief ever since. My Lord, there
has not been a Robbery committed
thus many years, within so many
miles of this place, but I have either
been at it, or privy to it.
The Judge thought the fellow
was mad, but after some conference
with some of the Justices, they agreed
to Indict him; and so they
did of several felonious Actions; to
all which he heartily confessed Guilty,
and so was hanged with his
Wife at the same time.
Atten. This is a remarkable Story
indeed, and you think it is a true
one.
Wise. It is not only remarkable,
but pat to our purpose. This Thief,

like Mr. Badman, began his Trade
betimes; he began too where Mr.
Badman began, even at robbing of
Orchards, and other such things,
which brought him as you may
perceive, from sin to sin, till at last
it brought him to the publick shame
of sin, which is the Gallows.
As for the truth of this Story,
the Relator told me that he was at
the same time himself in the Court,
and stood within less than two yards
of old Tod, when he heard him aloud
to utter the words.
Atten. These two sins of lying and
stealing were a bad sign of an evil
end.
Wise. So they were, and yet Mr.
Badman came not to his end like old
Tod; Though I fear, to as bad, nay,
worse than was that death of the
Gallows, though less discerued by
spectators; but more of that by and
by. But you talk of these two sins
as if these were all that Mr. Badman
was addicted to in his Youth:
Alas, alas, he swarmed with sins,
even as a Begger does with Vermin,
and that when he was but a
Boy.

Atten. Why what other sins was
he addicted to, I mean while he was
but a Child?
Wise. You need not ask, to what
other sins was he, but to what other
sins was he not addicted, that is,
of such as suited with his Age: for
a man may safely say, that nothing
that was vile came amiss to him; if
he was but capable to do it. Indeed
some sins there be that Childhood
knows not how to be tampering
with; but I speak of sins that he was
capable of committing, of which I
will nominate two or three more.
And,
First, He could not endure the
*Badman could not abide the Lords Day. Lords Day, because of the Holiness
that did attend it; the beginning
of that Day was to him as if
he was going to Prison, (except he
could get out from his Father and
Mother, and lurk in by-holes among
his Companions, untill holy
Duties were over.) Reading the
Scriptures, hearing Sermons, godly
Conference, repeating of Sermons,
and Prayer, were things that he
could not away with; and therefore
if his Father on such days

(as often he did, though sometimes
notwithstanding his diligence, he
would be sure to give him the slip)
did keep him strictly to the observation
of the day, he would plainly
shew by all carriages that he was
highly discontent therewith: he
would sleep at Duties, would talk
vainly with his Brothers, and as it
were, think every godly opportunity
seven times as long as it was,
grudging till it was over.
Atten. This his abhorring of that
day, was not, I think, for the sake
of the day it self: for as it is a day,
it is nothing else but as other days of
the Week: But I suppose that the
*Why Badman could not abide the Lords Day. reason of his loathing of it, was,
for that God hath put sanctity and
holiness upon it; also because it is
the day above all the days of the week
that ought to be spent in holy Devotion,
in remembrance of our Lords
Resurrection from the dead.
Wise. Yes, 'twas therefore, that
he was such an enemy to it, even
because more restraint was laid upon
him on that day, from his own
ways, than were possible should be
laid upon him on all others.

Atten. Doth not God by instituting
of a day unto holy Duties, make
great proof how the hearts and inclinations
of poor people do stand to Holiness
of heart, and a Conversation
in doly duties?
Wise. *God proves the heart what it is, by instituting of the Lords day, and setting it apart to his service. Yes doubtless; and a
man shall shew his Heart and his
Life what they are, more by one
Lords-day, than by all the days of
the week besides: And the reason
is, because on the Lords-day there
is a special restraint laid upon men
as to Thoughts and Life, more than
upon other days of the week besides.
Also, men are enjoyned on
that day to a stricter performance
of holy Duties, and restraint of
worldly business, than upon other
days they are; wherefore, if their
hearts incline not naturally to good,
now they will shew it, now they
will appear what they are. The
Lords Day is a kind of an Emblem
of the heavenly Sabbath above, and
it makes manifest how the heart
stands to the perpetuity of Holiness,
more than to be found in a
transient Duty, does.
On other days a man may be in

and out of holy Duties, and all in
a quarter of an hour; but now, the
Lords Day is, as it were, a day
that enjoyns to one perpetual Duty
of Holiness:  Remember that thou
keep holy the Sabbath day, (which
by Christ is not abrogated, but
changed, into the First of the week,)
not as it was given in particular to
the Jews, but as it was sanctified by
him from the Beginning of the
world; and therefore is a greater
proof of the frame and temper of
a mans heart, and does more make
manifest to what he is inclined,
than doth his other performance of
Duties: Therefore God puts great
difference between them that truly
call (and walk in) this day as holy,
and count it Honourable,  upon the
account that now they have an opportunity
to shew how they delight
to honour him; in that they have, 
not only an Hour, but a whole
Day to shew it in: I say, he puts
great difference between these, and
that other sort that say,  When will
the Sabbath be gone, that we may be
at our wordly business. The first he
calleth a Blessed man, but brandeth

the other for an unsanctified worldling.
And indeed, to delight our selves
in Gods service upon his Holy days,
gives a better proof of a sanctified
Nature, than to grudge at the coming,
and to be weary of the holy
duties of such dayes, as Mr. Badman
did.
Atten. There may be something in
what you say, for he that cannot abide
to keep one day holy to God, to be
sure he hath given a sufficient proof
that he is an unsanctified man; and
as such, what should he do in Heaven?
that being the place where a perpetual 
Sabath is to be kept to God; I say, to be
kept for ever and ever. And for ought
I know, one reason why one day in seven,
hath been by our Lord set apart
unto holy Duties for men, may be to
give them conviction that there is
enmity in the hearts of sinners to the
God of Heaven, for he that hateth
Holiness, hateth God himself. They
pretend to love God, and yet love
not a holy day, and yet love not to
spend that day in one continued act
of holiness to the Lord: They had as
good say nothing as to call him Lord,
Lord, and yet not doe the things that

he says. And this Mr. Badman
was such an one: he could not abide
this day, nor any of the Duties of it.
Indeed, when he could get from his
Friends, and so *How Badman did use to spend the Lords Day. spend it in all manner
of idleness and profaneness, then he
would be pleased well enough: but
what was this but a turning the day
into night, or other than taking an
opportunity at Gods forbidding, to
follow our Callings, to solace and satisfie
our lusts and delights of the
flesh. I take the liberty to speak thus
of Mr. Badman, upon a confidence of
what you, Sir, have said of him, is
true.
Wise. You needed not to have
made that Apology for your censuring
of Mr. Badman, for all that
knew him, will confirm what you
said of him to be true. He could
not abide either that day, or any
thing else that had the stamp or
image of God upon it. Sin, sin, and
to do the thing that was naught, was
that which he delighted in, and that
from a little Child.
Atten. I must say again, I am sorry
to hear it, and that for his own sake,
and also for the sake of his Relations,

who must needs be broken to pieces
with such doings as these: For, for
these things sake comes the wrath of 
God upon the Children of disobedience:
and doubtless he must be gone to Hell,
if he died without Repentance; and
to beget a Child for Hell, is sad for
Parents to think on.
Wise. Of his Dying, as I told
you, I will give you a Relation
anon, but now we are upon his
Life, and upon the Manner of his
Life in his Childhood, even of the
sins that attended him then, some
of which I have mentioned already;
and indeed I have mentioned but
some, for yet there are more to
follow, and those not at all inferiour
to what you have already heard.
Atten. Pray what were they?
Wise. Why he was greatly given,
and that while a Lad, to grievous
*Badman given to Swearing and Cursing. Swearing and Cursing: yea, he
then made no more of Swearing
and Cursing, than I do of telling my
fingers. Yea, he would do it without
provocation thereto. He counted
it a glory to Swear and Curse,
and it was as natural to him, as to
eat and drink and sleep.

Atten. Oh! what a young Villain
was this! here is, as the Apostle says,
a yielding of Members as instruments 
of unrighteousness unto sin, indeed!
This is proceeding from evil
to evil with a witness; This argueth
that he was a black-mouthed young
Wretch indeed.
Wise. He was so; and yet, as I
told you, he counted, above all, this
kind of sinning, to be *Swearing and Cursing a badge of Mr. Badmans honour. a Badge of
his Honour: He reckoned himself
a mans Fellow when he had learnt
to Swear and Curse boldly.
Atten. I am perswaded, that many
do think, as you have said, that to
Swear, is a thing that does bravely,
become them, and that it is the best
way for a man, when he would put
authority, or terrour into his words, to
stuff them full of the sin of Swearing.
Wise. You say right, else, as I
am perswaded, men would not so
usually belch out their blasphemous
Oaths, as they do: they take
a pride in it; they think that to
swear is Gentleman-like; and having
once accustomed themselves
unto it, they hardly leave it all the
days of their lives.

Atten. Well, but now we are upon it,
pray shew me *Difference betwixt Swearing and Cursing. the difference between
Swearing and Cursing; for there is a
difference, is there not?
Wise. Yes: There is a difference
between Swearing and Cursing.
Swearing, vain swearing, such as
young Badman accustomed himself
unto. Now vain and sinful swearing,
*What Swearing is. Is a light and wicked calling
of God, &c. to witness to our vain
and foolish attesting of things, and
those things are of two sorts.
1. Things that we swear, are, or
shall be done.
2. Things so sworn to, true or
false.
1. Things that we swear, are,
or shall be done. Thou swearest
thou hast done such a thing, that
such a thing is so, or shall be so;
for it is no matter which of these
it is that men swear about, if it be
done lightly and wickedly, and
groundlesly, it is vain, because it is
a sin against the Third Commandement, 
which says, Thou shalt not
take the Name of the Lord thy God
in vain. For this is a vain using of
that Holy and Sacred Name, and so

a sin for which, without sound Repentance,
there is not, nor can be
rightly expected, forgiveness.
Atten. Then it seems, though as
to the matter of fact, a man swears
truely, yet if he sweareth lightly and
groundlesly, his Oath is evil, and he
by it, under sin.
Wise. Yes; a man may say, 
†A man may sin in swearing to a truth. The Lord liveth, and that is true,
and yet in so saying, swear falsly;
because he sweareth vainly, needlesly,
and without a ground. To
swear groundedly and necessarily,
(which then a man does, when he
swears as being called thereto of
God,) that is tolerated by the
Word: but this was none of Mr.
Badmans swearing, and therefore
that which now we are not concerned
about.
Atten. I perceive, by the Prophet,
that a man may sin in swearing to a
Truth: They therefore must needs
most horribly sin, that swear to confirm
their Jests and Lies; and as
they think, the better to beautifie
their foolish talking.
Wise. They sin with an high
hand; for they presume to imagine,

†He that swears to a Lie, concludes that God is as wicked as himself. that God is as wicked as
themselves, to wit, that he is an
Avoucher of Lies to be true. For,
as I said before, to swear, is to call
God to witness; and to swear to
a Lie, is to call God to witness that
that Lie is true. This therefore must
needs offend; for it puts the highest
affront upon the Holiness and Righteousness
of God,  therefore his wrath
must sweep them away. This kind
of Swearing is put in with lying, 
and killing, and stealing, and committing
Adultery; and therefore
must not go unpunished: For if
God will not hold him guiltless that
taketh his Name in vain, which a
man may doe when he swears to a
truth, (as I have shewed before,)
how can it be imagined, that he
should hold such guiltless, who, by
Swearing, will appeal to God, if
Lies be not true, or that swear out
of their frantick and Bedlam madness.
It would grieve and provoke
a sober man to wrath, if one should
swear to a notorious lye, and avouch
that that man would attest it for a
truth; and yet thus do men deal with
the holy God: They tell their Jestings,

Tales and Lies, and then swear
by God that they are true. Now this
kind of Swearing was as common
with young Badman, as it was to
eat when he was an hungred, or to
go to bed when it was night.
Atten. I have often mused in my
mind, what it should be that should
make men so common in the use of the
sin of Swearing, since those that be
wise, will believe them never the sooner
for that.
Wise. It cannot be any thing that
is good, you may be sure; because
the thing it self is abominable:
*Six Causes of vain Swearing. 1. Therefore it must be from the
promptings of the spirit of the Devil
within them. 2. Also it flows sometimes
from hellish Rage, when the
tongue hath set on fire of Hell even 
the whole course of nature. 3. But
commonly Swearing flows from that
daring Boldness that biddeth defiance
to the Law that forbids it.
4. Swearers think also that by their
belching of their blasphemous Oaths
out of their black and polluted
mouths, they shew themselves the
more valiant men: 5. And imagine
also, that by these outrageous kind

of villianies, they shall conquer those
that at such a time they have to do
with, and make them believe their
lyes to be true: 6. They also swear
frequently to get Gain thereby,
and when they meet with fools, they
overcome them this way. But if
I might give advice in this matter,
no Buyer should lay out one farthing
with him that is a common Swearer
in his Calling; especially with such
an Oath-master that endeavoureth to
swear away his commodity to another,
and that would swear his
Chapmans money into his own pocket.
Atten. All these causes of Swearing,
so far as I can perceive, flow from
the same Root as doe the Oaths themselves,
even from a hardened and
desperate heart. But pray shew me
now how wicked cursing is to be distinguished
from this kind of swearing.
Wise: *How Cursing is distinguished from Swearing. Swearing, as I said, hath
immediately to do with the Name of
God, and it calls upon him to be
witness to the truth of what is said.
That is, if they that swear, swear
by him. Some indeed swear by
Idols, as by the Mass, by our Lady,

by Saints, Beasts, Birds, and other
creatures; but the usual way of our
profane ones in England, is to swear
by God, Christ, Faith, and the like:
But however, or by whatever they
swear, Cursing is distinguished from
Swearing thus.
*Of Cursing, what it is. To Curse, to Curse profanely, it is
to sentence another or our self, for,
or to evil: or to wish that some evil
might happen to the person or thing
under the Curse, unjustly.
It is to sentence for, or to evil,
(that is, without a cause): Thus
Shimei cursed David: He sentenced
him for and to evil unjustly, when he
said to him, Come out,  come out thou
bloody man, and thou man of Belial.
The Lord hath returned upon thee all
the blood of the house of Saul, in whose
stead thou hast reigned, and the Lord
hath delivered the kingdom into the
hand of Absalom thy son: and behold
thou art taken in thy mischief, because
thou art a bloody man.
This David calls a grievous Curse. 
And behold, saith he to Solomon his
Son, thou hast with thee Shimei a Benjamite,
which cursed me with a grievous
curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim.

But what was this Curse? Why,
Eirst, It was a wrong sentence past
upon David; Shimei called him
Bloody man, man of Belial, when
he was not. Secondly, He sentenced
him to the evil that at present
was upon him, for being a bloody
man, (that is, against the house of
Saul,) when that present evil overtook
David, for quite another
thing.
And we may thus apply it to the
*How the profane ones of our times Curse. profane ones of our times, who
in their rage and envy, have little
else in their mouths but a sentence
against their Neighbour for, and to
evil unjustly. How common is it
with many, when they are but a little
offended with one, to cry, Hang
him, Damn him, Rogue! This is both
a sentencing of him for, and to
evil, and is in it self a grievous
Curse.
2. The other kind of Cursing, is
to wish that some evil might happen
to, and overtake this or that person
or thing: And this kind of Cursing,
Job counted a grievous sin. I have
not suffered (says he) my mouth to sin, 
by wishing a curse to his soul; or consequently

to Body or Estate. This
then is a wicked cursing, to wish
that evil might either befall another
or our selves: And this kind of cursing
young Badman accustomed himself
unto.
1.Badmans way of Cursing. He would wish that evil might
befall others; he would wish their
Necks broken, or that their Brains
were out, or that the Pox, or Plague
was upon them, and the like: All
which is a devilish kind of cursing,
and is become one of the common
sins of our age.
2. He would also as often wish a
Curse to himself, saying, Would I
might be hanged, or burned, or that
the Devil might fetch me, if it be
not so, or the like. We count
the *The Damme Blade. Damme Blades to be great
Swearers; but when in their hellish
fury they say, God-damme me, God
perish me, or the like, they rather
curse than swear; yea, curse themselves,
and that with a Wish that
Damnation might light upon themselves;
which wish and Curse of
theirs, in a little time, they will see
accomplished upon them, even in
Hell-sire, if they repent them not of
their sins.

Atten. But did this young Badman
accustom himself to such filthy kind of
language?
Wise. I think I may say, that
nothing was more frequent in his
mouth, and that upon the least provocation.Badman would curse his Father, &c. Yea he was so versed in
such kind of language, that neither
Father, nor Mother, nor Brother, nor
Sister, nor Servant, no nor the very
Cattel that his Father had, could
escape these Curses of his. I say, that
even the bruit Beasts when he drove
them, or rid upon them, if they
pleased not his humour, they must
be sure to partake of his curse. *Badman would curse his Fathers Cattel. He
would wish their Necks broke, their
Legs broke, their Guts out, or that
the Devil might fetch them, or the
like: and no marvel, for he that is
so hardy to wish damnation, or other
bad curses to himself, or dearest relations;
will not stick to wish evil
to the silly Beast; in his madness.
Atten. Well, I see still that this
Badman was a desperate villain. But
pray, Sir, since you have gone thus
far, now shew me whence this evil of
cursing ariseth, and also what dishonour
it bringeth to God; for I

easily discern that it doth bring damnation
to the soul.
Wise. This evil of Cursing ariseth, 
in general, from the desperate wickedness
of the heart, but particularly
from, †Four causes of Cursing. 1. Envie, which is, as I
apprehend, the leading sin to Witchcraft.
2. It also ariseth from Pride
which was the sin of the fallen Angels;
3. It ariseth too from Scorn and contempt
of others: 4. But for a man
to curse himself, must needs arise
from desperate Madness.
The *The dishonour it brings to God. dishonour that it bringeth
to God, is this. It taketh away from
him his Authority, in whose power
it is onely, to Bless and Curse; not
to Curse wickedly, as Mr. Badman,
but justly, and righteously, giving
by his Curse, to those that are
wicked, the due Reward of their
deeds.
Besides, these wicked men, in
their wicked cursing of their Neighbour,
&c.  do even Curse God himself
in his handy work. Man is Gods
Image, and to curse wickedly the
Image of God, is to curse God himself.
Therefore as when men wickedly
swear, they rend, and tare

Gods Name, and make him, as much
as in them lies, the avoucher and approver
of all their wickedness; so
he that curseth and condemneth in
this sort his Neighbour, or that wisheth
him evil, curseth, condemneth,
and wisheth evil to the Image of
God, and consequently judgeth and
condemneth God himself.
Suppose that a man should say
with his mouth, I wish that the
Kings Picture was burned; would
not this mans so saying, render
him as an Enemy to the Person of
the King? Even so it is with them
that, by cursing, wish evil to their
neighbour, or to themselves, they
contemn the Image, even the Image
of God himself.
Atten. But do you think that the
men that do thus, do think that they
do so vilely, so abominably?
Wise. The question is not what
men do believe concerning their sin,
but what Gods Word says of it: If
Gods Word says that Swearing and
Cursing are sins, though men should
count them for Vertues, their reward
will be a reward for sin, to wit,
the damnation of the soul.

To *Swearing and Cursing are sins against the light of Nature. curse another, and to swear
vainly and falsly, are sins against
the Light of Nature.
1. To Curse is so, because, whoso
curseth another, knows, that at
the same time he would not be so
served himself.
2. To Swear also, is a sin against
the same Law: for Nature will tell
me, that I should not lie, and therefore
much less Swear to confirm it.
Yea,  the Heathens have looked
upon Swearing to be a solemn Ordinance
of God, and therefore not
to be lightly or vainly used by
men, though to confirm a matter of
truth.
Atten. But I wonder, since Curseing
and Swearing are such evils in
the eyes of God, that he doth not
make some Examples to others, for
their committing such wickedness.
Wise. Alas! so he has, a thousand
times twice told, as may be
easily gathered by any observing
people in every Age and Countrey.
I could present you with several
my self; but waving the abundance
that might be mentioned, I will
here present you with *Examples of Gods anger against them that Swear and Curse. two; One

was that dreadful Judgment of God
upon one N. P. at Wimbleton in
Surrey; &rhand; who, after a horrible fit
of Swearing at, and Cursing of some
persons that did not please him, suddenly
fell sick, and in little time died
raving, cursing and swearing.
But above all take that dreadful
Story of Dorothy Mately an Inhabitant
of Ashover in the County of
Darby.
&rhand; This Dorothy Mately, faith the
Relator, was noted by the people
of the Town to be a great Swearer,
and Curser, and Lier, and Thief;
(just like Mr. Badman.) And the
labour that she did usually follow,
was to wash the Rubbish that came
forth of the Lead Mines, and there
to get sparks of Lead-Ore; and her
usual way of asserting of things, was
with these kind of Imprecations:
I would I might sink into the earth
if it be not so, or I would God would
make the earth open and swallow me
up. Now upon the 23. of March,
1660. this Dorothy was washing of
Ore upon the top of a steep Hill,
about a quarter of a mile from Ashover,
and was there taxed by a Lady

for taking of two single Pence out
of his Pocket, (for he had laid his
Breeches by, and was at work in
his Drawers;) but she violently denyed
it, wishing, That the ground
might swallow her up if she had them:
She also used the same wicked
words on several other occasions
that day.
Now one George Hodgkinson of
Ashover, a man of good report
there, came accidentally by where
this Dorothy was, and stood still a
while to talk with her, as she was
washing her Ore; there stood also
a little Child by her Tub-side, and
another a distance from her, calling
aloud to her to come away; wherefore
the said George took the Girle
by the hand to lead her away to her
that called her: But behold, they
had not gone above ten yards from
Dorothy, but they heard her crying
out for help; so looking back, he
saw the Woman, and her Tub, and
Sive, twirling round, and sinking
into the ground. Then said the
man, Pray to God to pardon thy sin,
for thou art never like to be seen alive
any longer. So she and her Tub

twirled round, and round, till they
sunk about three yards into the
Earth, and then for a while staid.
Then she called for help again,
thinking, as she said, that she should
stay there. Now the man though
greatly amazed, did begin to think
which way to help her, but immediately
a great stone which appeared
in the Earth, fell upon her head,
and brake her Skull, and then the
Earth fell in upon her and covered
her. She was afterwards digged up,
and found about four yards within
ground, with the Boys two single
Pence in her pocket, but her Tub
and Sive could not be found.
&rhand; Atten. You bring to my mind a sad
story, the which I will relate unto you.
The thing is this; About a bow-shoot
from where I once dwelt, there was
a blind Ale-house, and the man that
kept it had a Son whose name was
Edward. This Edward was, as it
were, an half-fool, both in his words,
and manner of behaviour. To this
blind. Ale-house certain jovial companions
would once or twice a week come,
and this Ned, (for so they called
him) his Father would entertain his

guests withall; to wit, by calling for
him to make them sport by his foolish
words and gestures. So when
these boon blades came to this mans
house, the Father would call for Ned:
Ned therefore would come forth; and
the villain was devilishly addicted to
cursing, yea to cursing his Father and
Mother, and any one else that did cross
him. And because (though he was
an half-fool) he saw that his practice
was pleasing, he would do it with the
more audaciousness.
Well, when these brave fellows did
come at their times to this Tippling-house
(as they call it) to fuddle and
make merry, then must Ned be called
out; and because his Father was best
acquainted with Ned, and best knew
how to provoke him, therefore He
would usually ask him such questions,
or command him such business, as
would be sure to provoke him indeed.
Then would he (after his foolish manner)
Curse his Father most bitterly;
at which the old man would laugh,
(and so would the rest of the guests,
as at that which pleased them best)
still continuing to ask, that Ned still
might be provoked to curse, that they

might still be provoked to laugh. This
was the mirth with which the old man
did use to entertain his guests.
The curses wherewith this Ned did
use to curse his father, and at which
the old man would laugh, were these,
and such like: The Devil take you;
The Devil fetch you: He would also
wish him Plagues and Destructions
many. Well, so it came to pass, through
the righteous Judgement of God, that
Neds Wishes and Curses were in a little
time fulfilled upon his Father; for
not many months passed between them
after this manner, but the Devil did
indeed take him, possess him, and also
in few days carried him out of this
world by death; I say, Satan did take
him and possess him: I mean, so it was
judged by those that knew him, and
had to do with him in that his lamentable
condition. He could feel him
like a live thing goe up and down in his
body, but when tormenting time was
come (as he had often tormenting
fits) then he would lye like an hard
bump in the soft place of his chest, (I
mean, I saw it so,) and so would rent
and tare him, and make him roar till
he died away.

I told you before, that I was an ear
and eye witness of what I here say;
and so I was. I have heard Ned in
his Roguery, cursing his Father, and
his Father laughing thereat most heartily;
still provoking of Ned to curse,
that his mirth might be encreased. I
saw his Father also, when he was possessed,
I saw him in one of his fits,
and saw his flesh (as 'twas thought) by
the Devil, gathered up on an heap,
about the bigness of half an Egge; to
the unutterable torture and affliction
of the old man. There was also one
Freeman, (who was more than an
ordinary Doctor) sent for, to cast out
this Devil; and I was there when he
attempted to do it: The manner whereof
was this. They had the possessed
into an out-room, and laid him on his
belly upon a Form, with his head hanging
over the Forms end; then they
bound him down thereto: which done,
they set a pan of Coals under his
mouth and put something therein which
made a great smoak; by this means
(as was said) to fetch out the
Devil. There therefore they kept the
man till he was almost smothered in
the smoak, but no Devil came out of

him; at which Freeman was somewhat
abashed, the man greatly afflicted,
and I made to go away wondering
and fearing. In a little time
therefore that which possessed the man,
carried him out of the World, according
to the cursed Wishes of his
Son. And this was the end of this
hellish mirth.
Wise. These were all sad Judgements.
Atten. These were dreadful Judgments
indeed.
Wise. Ai, and they look like the
Threatning of that Text, (though
chiefly it concerned Judas,) As he
loved cursing,  so let it come unto
him; as he delighted not in blessing,
so let it be far from him. As he
cloathed himself with cursing as with
a garment, so let it come into his
bowels like water, and as oyl into his
bones.
Atten. It is a fearful thing for
Youth to be trained up in a way of
Cursing and Swearing.
Wise. Trained up in them! that
I cannot say Mr. Badman was, for
his Father hath oft-times in my
hearing, bewailed the badness of

his Children, and of this naughty
Boy in particular. I believe that
the wickedness of his Children made
him (in the thoughts of it) goe many
a Night with heavy heart to bed,
and with as heavy an one to rise in
the Morning. But all was one to
his graceless Son, neither wholsom
counsel, nor fatherly sorrow, would
make him mend his Manners.
*A grievous thing to bring up Children wickedly. There are some indeed that do
train up their Children to swear,
curse, lye and steal, and great is the
misery of such poor Children whose
hard hap it is to be ushered into
the world by, and to be under the
tuition too of such ungodly Parents.
It had been better for such Parents,
had they not begat them, and better
for such Children had they not been
born. O! methinks for a Father
or a Mother to train up a Child in
that very way that leadeth to Hell
and Damnation, what thing so horrible!
But Mr. Badman was not by
his Parents so brought up.
Atten. But methinks, since this
Young Badman would not be ruled
at home, his Father should have tryed
what good could have been done of him

abroad, by putting him out to some man
of his acquaintance, that he knew to
be able to command him, and to keep
him pretty hard to some employ: So
should he, at least, have been prevented
of time to do those wickednesses
that could dot be done without time
to do them in.
Wise. Alas, his Father did so, *Badman put to be an Apprentice. he
put him out betimes to one of his
own Acquaintance, and entreated
him of all love, that he would take
care of his Son, and keep him from
extravagant wayes. His Trade also
was honest and commodious; he
had besides a full Employ therein,
so that this young Badman had no
vacant seasons nor idle hours yielded
him by his Calling, therein to
take opportunities to do Badly:
but all was one to him, as he had
begun to be vile in his Fathers
house, even so he continued to be
when he was in the house of his
Master.
Atten. I have known some Children,
who though they have been very
Bad at home, yet have altered much
when they have been put out abroad;
especially when they have fallen into a

Family, where the Governours there,
of have made conscience of maintaining
of the Worship and Service of
God therein; but perhaps that might
be wanting in Mr. Badmans Masters
house.
Wise. Indeed some Children do
greatly mend, when put under other
mens Roofs; but, as I said, this
naughty boy did not so; nor did his
badness continue, because he wanted
a Master that both could and
did correct it: For his *Young Badmans Master, and his qualifications. Master
was a very good man, a very devout
person; one that frequented
the best Soul-means, that set up the
Worship of God in his Family, and
also that walked himself thereafter.
He was also a man very meek and
merciful, one that did never overdrive
young Badman in business, nor
that kept him at it at unseasonable
hours.
Atten. Say you so! This is rare:
I for my part can see but few that
can parallel, in these things, with Mr.
Badmans Master.
Wise. Nor I neither, (yet Mr.
Badman
had such an one;) for, for
the most part, †A bad Master, a bad thing. Masters are now a

days such as mind nothing but their
worldly concerns, and if Apprentices
do but answer their commands
therein, Soul and Religion may go
whither they will. Yea, I much fear,
that there have been many towardly
Lads put out by their parents to such
Masters, that have quite undone
them as to the next world.
Atten. The more is the pity. But
pray, now you have touched upon this
subject, shew me how many wayes a
Master may be the ruin of his poor
Apprentice.
Wise. Nay, I cannot tell you of all
the wayes, yet some of them I will
mention.
Suppose then that a towardly Lad
be put to be an Apprentice with one
that is reputed to be a Godly man,
yet that Lad may be ruined many
wayes; that is, if his Master be not
circumspect in all things that respect
both God and man, and that before
his Apprentice.
1. †How many ways a Master may be the ruin of an Apprentice. If he be not moderate in the
use of his Apprentice; if he drives
him beyond his strength; if he
holds him to work at unseasonable
hours; if he will not allow him convenient

time to read the Word, to
Pray, &c. This is the way to destroy
him; that is, in those tender
beginings of good thoughts,
and good beginnings about spiritual
things.
2. If he suffers his house to be
scattered with profane and wicked
Books, such as stir up to lust, to wantonness,
such as teach idle, wanton,
lascivious discourse, and such as has
a tendency to provoke to profane
drollery and Jesting; and lastly, such
as tend to corrupt, and pervert the
Doctrine of Faith and Holiness. All
these things will eat as doth a canker,
and will quickly spoil, in Youth, &c.
those good beginnings that may
be putting forth themselves in
them.
3. If there be a mixture of Servants,
that is, if some very bad be
in the same place, that's a way also
to undo such tender Lads; for they
that are bad and sordid Servants,
will be often (and they have an
opportunity too, to be) distilling
and fomenting of their profane and
wicked words and tricks before
them, and these will easily stick in

the flesh and minds of Youth, to the
corrupting of them.
4. If the Master have one Guise
for abroad, and another for home;
that is, if his Religion hangs by in
his house as his Cloak does, and he
be seldom in it, except he be abroad;
this, young beginners will
take notice of, and stumble at. We
say, Hedges have eyes, and little
Pitchers have ears; and indeed,
†Children are great observers of what older folks doe. Children make a greater inspection
into the Lives of Fathers,
Masters, &c. than oft-times they are
aware of: And therefore should
Masters be carefull, else they may
soon destroy good beginnings in
their Servants.
5. If the Master be unconscionable
in his Dealing, and trades
with lying words; or if bad Commodities
be avouched to be good,
or if he seeks after unreasonable
gain, or the like; his servant sees
it, and it is enough to undo him.
Elies Sons being bad before the congregation, 
made Men despise the
sacrifices of the Lord.
But these things by the by, only
they may serve for a hint to Masters

to take heed that they take not Apprentices
to destroy their Souls. But
young Badman had none of these
hinderances; *Badman had all advantages to be good, but continued Badman still. His father took care,
and provided well for him, as to
this: He had a good Master, he
wanted not good Books, nor good
Instruction, nor good Sermons, nor
good Examples, no nor good fellow-Servants
neither: but all would not
doe.
Atten. 'Tis a wonder, that in such
a Family, amidst so many spiritual
helps, nothing should take hold of his
heart! What! not good Books, nor
good Instructions, nor good Sermons,
nor good Examples, nor good fellow-Servants,
nor nothing do him good!
Wise. You talk, he minded none
of these things; nay, all these were
*All good things abominable to Badman. abominable to him.
1. For good Books, they might
lie in his Masters house till they rotted
for him, he would not regard
to look into them; but, contrarywise,
would get all the bad and abominable
Books that he could, as
beastly Romances, and books full
of Ribbauldry, even such as immediately
tended to set all fleshly lusts

on fire. True, he durst not be
known to have any of these, to his
Master; therefore would he never
let them be seen by him, but would
keep them in close places, and peruse
them at such times, as yielded
him fit opportunities thereto.
2. For good Instruction, he liked
that, much as he liked good books;
his care was to hear but little thereof,
and to forget what he heard as
soon as 'twas spoken. Yea, I have
heard some that knew him then,
say, that one might evidently discern
by the shew of his countenance and
gestures, that good counsel was to
him like *Good counsel to Badman like Little-ease. little-ease, even a continual
torment to him; nor did he
ever count himself at liberty, but
when farthest off of wholsom words.
He would hate them that rebuked 
him,  and count them his deadly enemies.
3. For good Example; which
was frequently set him by his Master,
both in Religious and Civil
matters; these, young Badman would
laugh at, and would also make a byword
of them, when he came in
place where he with safety could.

4. His Master indeed would
make him go with him to Sermons,
and that where he thought the best
Preachers were, but this ungodly
young man, what shall I say, was
(I think) a Master of Art in all
mischief; he had these wicked ways
to hinder himself of hearing, let the
Preacher thunder never so loud.
1. *How Badman used to behave himself at Sermons. His way was, when come
into the place of hearing, to sit
down in some corner, and then to
fall fast asleep.
2. Or else to fix his adulterous
eyes upon some beautifull Object
that was in the place, and so all
Sermon-while, therewith be feeding
of his fleshly lusts.
3. Or, if he could get near to
some that he had observed would fit
his humour, he would be whispering,
gigling, and playing with them, till
such time as Sermon was done.
Atten. Why! he was grown to a
prodigious height of wickedness.
Wise. He was so, and that which
aggravates all, was, this was his
practice as soon as he was come to
his Master, he was as ready at all
these things, as if he had, before he

came to his Master, served an Apprentiship
to learn them.
Atten. There could not but be added
(as you relate them) Rebellion to
his sin. Methinks it is as if he had
said, I will not hear, I will not regard,
I will not mind good, I will
not mend, I will not turn, I will not
be converted.
Wise. You say true, and I know
not to whom more fitly to compare
&rhand; him, †The desperate words of one H. S. who once was my Companion. He was own brother to Ned, of whom you read before. than to that man, who when
I my self rebuked him for his wickedness,
in this great huff replied;
What would the Devil do for company,
if it was not for such as I.
Atten. Why did you ever hear any
man say so.
Wise. Yes, that I did; and this
young Badman was as like him, as
an Egg is like an Egg. Alas! the
Scripture makes mention of many
that by their actions speak the
same.  They say unto God, Depart
from us, for we desire not the
knowledge of thy ways; Again, They
refuse to hearken,  and pull away their
shoulder, and stop their ears; yea, they
make their hearts hard as an Adamant-stone,
lest they should hear the

Law, and the words that the Lord
of Host hath sent. What are all
these but such as Badman, and such
as the young man but now mentioned?
That young man was my
Play-fellow when I was solacing my
self in my sins: I may make mention
of him to my shame; but he
has a great many fellows.
Atten. Young Badman was like him
indeed, and he trod his steps, as
if his wickedness had been his very
Copy; I mean, as to his desperateness:
for had he not been a desperate one,
he would never have made you such
a reply, when you was rebuking of
him for his sin. But when did you
give him such a rebuke?
Wise. A while after God had
parted him and I, by Calling of me
(as I hope) by his Grace, still leaving
him in his sins; and so far as I
could ever gather, as he lived, so
he died, even as Mr. Badman did:
but we will leave him, and return
again to our discourse.
Atten. Ha, poor obstinate sinners!
doe they think that God cannot be even
with them?
Wise. I do not know, what they

think, but I know that God hath
said,  That as He cried, and they
would not hear, so they shall crie, and
I will not hear, saith the Lord.
Doubtless there is a time a coming,
when Mr. Badman will crie for
this.
Atten. But I wonder that he should
be so expert in wickedness, so soon!
alas, he was but a Stripling, I suppose
he was, as yet, not Twenty.
Wise. No, nor Eighteen neither:
but (as with Ishmael,  and with the
Children that mocked the Prophet)
the seeds of sin did put forth themselves
betimes in him.
Atten. Well, he was as wicked a
young man as commonly one shall hear
of.
Wise. You will say so, when you
know all.
Atten. All, I think here is a great.
All; but if there is more behind, pray
let us hear it.
Wise. Why, then I will tell you,
that he had not been with his Master
much above a year and a half, but
he came †Badmans Acquaintance. acquainted with three
young Villains (who here shall be
nameless,) that taught him to adde

to his sin, much of like kind; and
he as aptly received their Instructions.
One of them was chiefly given
to Uncleanness, another to Drunkenness;
and the third to Purloining,
or stealing from his Master.
Atten. Alas poor Wretch, he was
bad enough before, but these, I suppose,
made him much worse.
Wise. That they made him worse
you may be sure of, for they taught
him to be an Arch, a chief one in
all their wayes.
Atten. It was an ill hap that he
ever came acquinted with them.
Wise. You must rather word it
thus. *A Sign of Gods Anger. It was the Judgement of
God that he did; that is, he
came acquainted with them, through
the anger of God. He had a good
Master, and before him a good Father:
By these he had good counsel
given him for Months and Years
together; but his heart was set
upon mischief, he loved wickedness
more than to do good, even untill
his Iniquity came to be hateful;
therefore, from the anger of God it
was, that these companions of his,
and he, did at last so acquaint together.

Sayes Paul, They did not
like to retain God in their knowledge;
and what follows?  wherefore, God
gave them over, or up to their own
hearts lusts. And again, As for such
as turn aside to their own crooked 
wayes, the Lord shall lead them forth
with the workers of iniquity. This
therefore was Gods hand upon him,
that he might be destroyed, be
damned;  because he received not
the love of the Truth that he might
be saved. He chose his Delusions
and Deluders for him, even the
company of base men,  of Fools, that
he might be destroyed.
Atten. I cannot but think indeed,
that it is a Great Judgment of God
for a man to be given up to the company
of vile men; for what are such
but the Devils *The Devils Decoys. Decoyes, even those
by whom he drawes the simple into
his Net? A Whoremaster, a Drunkard,
a Thiefe, what are they but the
Devils baits, by which he catcheth
others?
Wise. You say right; but this
young Badman was no simple one,
if by simple, you mean one uninstructed;
for he had often good counsel

given him: but if by simple, you
mean, him that is a Fool as to the
true Knowledge of, and Faith in
Christ, then he was a simple one
indeed: for he chose death, rather
than life, and to live in continual
opposition to God, rather than to
be Reconciled unto him; according
to that saying of the wise man;
The fooles hated knowledge,  and did
not choose the Fear of the Lord: and
what Judgement more dreadfull can
a fool be given up to, than to be
delivered into the hands of such men,
that have skill to do nothing, but to
ripen sin, and hasten its finishing
unto damnation? And therefore men
should be afraid of offending God,
because he can in this manner punish
them for their sins. &rhand;I knew 
a man that once was, as I thought,
hopefully awakened about his Condition;
yea, I knew two that were
so awakened; but in time they began
to draw back, and to incline
again to their lusts; wherefore,
God gave them up to the company
of three or four men, that in
less than three years time brought
them roundly to the Gallows,This was done at Bedford. where

they were hanged like Dogs, because
they refused to live like honest
men.
Atten. But such men do not believe,
that thus to be given up of
God, is in Judgement and anger,
they rather take it to be their liberty,
and do count it their happiness; they
are glad that their Cord is loosed,
and that the reins are in their neck;
they are glad that they may sin without
controul, and that they may choose
such company as can make them more
expert in an evil way.
Wise. Their Judgement is therefore
so much the greater, because
thereto is added blindness of Mind,
and hardness of Heart in a wicked
way. They are turned up to the
way of Death, but must not see to
what place they are going: They
must go as the Ox to the slaughter,
and as the Fool to the Correction
of the Stocks,  till a Dart strikes
through their Liver, not knowing
that it is for their life. This, I say,
makes their Judgement double, they
are given up of God, for a while to
sport themselves with that which
will assuredly make them mourn at 

last, when their flesh and their body
is consumed. These are those that
Peter speaks of, that shall utterly
perish in their own corruptions;
these, I say, who count it pleasure to
ryot in the day-time,  and that sport
themselves with their own deceivings,
are, as natural bruit beasts, made to
be taken and destroyed.
Atten. Well, but I pray now concerning
these three Villains that were
young Badmans companions: Tell me
more particularly how he carried it
then.
Wise. How he carried it! why,
he did as they. I intimated so much
before, when I said, they made him
an arch, a chief one in their ways.
First, He became a Frequenter of
*Badman becomes a frequenter of Taverns. Taverns and Tippling-houses, and
would stay there untill he was even
as drunk as a Beast. And if it was
so, that he could not get out by
day, he would, be sure, get out by
night. Yea, he became so common
a Drunkard, at last, that he was taken
notice of to be a Drunkard even
by all.
Atten. This was Swinish, for
Drunkenness is so beastly a sin, a sin

so much against Nature, that I wonder
that any that have but the appearance
of Men, can give up themselves
to so beastly (yea, worse than
beastly) a thing.
&rhand; Wise. It is a Swinish vanity indeed.
*A Story for a Drunkard. I will tell you another Story.
There was a Gentleman that
had a Drunkard to be his Groom,
and coming home one night very
much abused with Beer, his Master
saw it. Well (quoth his Master
within himself,) I will let thee alone
to night, but to morrow morning
I will convince thee that thou
art worse than a Beast, by the behaviour
of my Horse. So when morning
was come, he bids his man goe
and water his Horse, and so he did;
but coming up to his Master, he
commands him to water him again;
so the fellow rid into the water the
second time, but his masters horse
would now drink no more, so the
fellow came up and and told his Master.
Then said his Master, Thou
drunken sot, thou are far worse than
my Horse, he will drink but to satisfie
nature, but thou wilt drink to
the abuse of nature; he will drink

but to refresh himself, but thou to
thy hurt and dammage; He will
drink, that he may be more serviceable
to his Master, but thou, till
thou art uncapable of serving either
God or Man. O thou Beast, how
much art thou worse than the horse
that thou ridest on.
Atten. Truly I think that his Master
served him right; for in doing
as he did, he shewed him plainly, as he
said, that he had not so much government
of himself as his horse had of himself,
and consequently that his beast
did live more according to the Law of
his nature by far, than did his man.
But pray go on with what you have
further to say.
Wise. Why, I say, that there are
†Four evils attend drunkenness. four things; which if they were well
considered, would make drunkenness
to be abhorred in the thoughts
of the Children of men.
1. It greatly tendeth to impoverish
and beggar a man. The Drunkard, 
says Solomon, shall come to poverty.
Many that have begun the
world with Plenty, have gone out
of it in Rags, through drunkenness.
Yea, many Children that have been

born to good Estates, have yet been
brought to a Flail & a Rake, through
this beastly sin of their Parents.
2. This sin of Drunkenness, it
bringeth upon the Body, many,
great, and incurable Diseases, by
which Men do in little time come to
their end, and none can help them.
So,  because they are overmuch wicked,
therefore they dye before their
time.
3. Drunkenness, is a sin that is
often times attended with abundance
of other evils. Who hath woe?
Who hath sorrow?  Who hath contention?
Who hath babblings? Who hath
wounds without cause? Who hath
redness of the eyes? They that tarry
long at the Wine, they that go to seek
mixt wine. That is, the Drunkard.
4. By Drunkenness, Men do
often times shorten their dayes; goe
out of the Ale-house drunk, and
break their Necks before they come
home. Instances not a few might
be given of this, but this is so manifest,
a man need say nothing.
Atten.  *The fifth evil the worst. But that which is worse
than all is, it also prepares men for
everlasting burnings.

Wise. Yea, and it so stupifies and
besotts the soul, that a man that is
far gone in Drunkenness, is hardly
ever recovered to God. Tell me,
when did you see an old drunkard
converted? No, no, such an one
will sleep till he dies, though he
sleeps on the top of a *  Mast, let his
dangers be never so great, and Death
and damnation never so near, he will
not be awaked out of his sleep. So
that if a man have any respect either
to Credit, Health, Life or Salvation,
he will not be a drunken man. But
the truth is, where this sin gets the
upper hand, men are, as I said before,
so intoxicated and bewitched
with the seeming pleasures, and
sweetness thereof; that they have
neither heart nor mind to think of
that which is better in it self; and
would, if imbraced, do them good.
Atten. You said that drunkenness
tends to poverty, yet some make themselves
rich by drunken bargains.
Wise. *An Objection answered. I said so, because the
Word says so. And as to some mens
getting thereby, that is indeed but
rare, and base: yea, and base will
be the end of such gettings. The

Word of God is against such wayes,
and the curse of God will be the end
of such doings. An Inheritance may
sometimes thus be hastily gotten
at the beginning, but the end thereof
shall not be blessed. Hark what
the Prophet saith;  Wo to him that
coveteth an evil covetousness, that he
may set his nest on high. Whether he
makes drunkenness, or ought else,
the engine and decoy to get it; for
that man doth but consult the shame
of his own house, the spoiling of his
family, and the damnation of his
Soul; for that which he getteth by
working of iniquity, is but a getting
by the devices of Hell; Therefore
he can be no gainer neither for himself
or family, that gains by an evil
course. But this was one of the sins
that Mr. Badman was addicted to after
he came acquainted with these
three fellows, nor could all that his
Master could do break him of this
Beastly sin.
Atten. But where, since he was
but an Apprentice, could he get Money
to follow this practice, for drunkenness,
as you have intimated, is a
very costly sin.

Wise. His Master *Badmans Masters Purse paid for his drunkenness. paid for all.
For, (as I told you before) as he
learned of these three Villains to be
a Beastly Drunkard; so he learned
of them to pilfer and steal from his
Master. Sometimes he would sell
off his Masters Goods, but keep the
Money, that is when he could; also
sometimes he would beguile his
Master by taking out of his Cashbox:
and when he could do neither of
these, he would convey away of his
Masters wares, what he thought
would be least missed, and send or
carry them to such and such houses,
where he knew they would be laid
up to his use, and then appoint set
times there, to meet and make merry
with these fellowes.
Atten. This, was as bad, nay,
I think, worse than the former; for by
thus doing, he did, not only run himself
under the wrath of God, but has
endangered the undoing of his Master
and his Familie.
Wise. Sins go not alone, but follow
one the other as do the links of
a Chain; he that will be a drunkard,
must have money either of his own,
or of some other mans; either of his

Fathers, Mothers, Masters, or at the
high-way, or some way.
Atten. I fear that many an honest
man is undone by such kind of servants.
Wise. I am of the same mind with
you, but *A Caution for Masters. this should make the
dealer the more wary what kind of
Servants he keeps, and what kind of
Apprentices he takes. It should also
teach him to look well to his Shop
himself, also to take strict account
of all things that are bought and
sold by his Servants. The Masters
neglect herein may embolden his
servant to be bad, and may bring
him too in short time to rags and
a morsel of Bread.
Atten. I am afraid that there is
much of this kind of pilfering among
servants in these bad dayes of ours.
Wise. Now, while it is in my
mind, I will tell you a story. &rhand;When
I was in prison, there came a woman
to me that was under a great deal of
trouble. So I asked her (she being
a stranger to me) what she had to
say to me. She said, she was afraid
she should be damned. I asked her
the cause of those fears. She told me

that she had sometime since lived with
a Shop-keeper at Wellingborough,
and had robbed his box in the Shop
several times of Money, to the value
of more than now I will say; and pray,
says she, tell me what I shall do. I told
her, I would have her go to her
Master, and make him satisfaction:
She said, she was afraid; I asked her
why? She said, she doubted he would
hang her. I told her, that I would
intercede for her life, and would
make use of other friends too to do
the like; But she told me, she durst
not venture that. Well, said I, shall
I send to your Master, while you
abide out of sight, and make your
peace with him, before he sees
you; and with that, I asked her
her Masters name. But all that she
said in answer to this, was, Pray let
it alone till I come to you again. So
away she went, and neither told me
her Masters Name, nor her own:
This is about ten or twelve years
since, and I never saw her again.
I tell you this story for this cause;
to confirm your fears, that such kind
of servants too many there be; and
that God makes them sometimes

like old Tod, of whom mention was
made before, (through the terrors
that he layes upon them) to betray
themselves.
&rhand; I could tell you of another, that
came to me with a like relation concerning
her self, and the robbing of
her Mistress; but at this time let
this suffice.
Atten. But what was that other
Villain addicted to, I mean, young Badmans
third companion?
Wise. *Badmans third companion addicted to Uncleanness. Uncleanness. I told you
before, but it seems you forgot.
Atten. Right, it was Uncleanness.
Uncleanness is also a filthy sin.
Wise. It is so; and yet it is one
of the most reigning sins in our day.
Atten. So they say, and that too
among those that one would think
had more wit, even among the great
ones.
Wise. The more is the pity: for
usually Examples that are set by
them that are great and chief,
*Sins of great men dangerous. spread sooner, and more universally,
then do the sins of other men;
yea, and when such men are at the
head in transgressing, sin walks with
a bold face through the Land. As

Jeremiah saith of the Prophets, so
may it be said of such, From them
is profaneness gone forth into all the
land; that is, with bold and audacious
face, Jer. 23, 15.
Atten. But pray let us return again
to Mr. Badman and his companions.
You say one of them was very
vile in the commission of Uncleanness.
Wise. Yes, so I say; not but that
he was a Drunkard and also Thievish,
but he was most arch in this
sin of Uncleanness: This Roguery
was his Master-piece, for he was a
Ringleader to them all in the beastly
sin of Whoredom. He was also
best acquainted with such houses
where they were, and so could readily
lead the rest of his Gang unto
them. The Strumpets also, because
they knew this young Villain, would
at first discover themselves in all
their whorish pranks to those that
he brought with him.
Atten. That is a deadly thing:
I mean, it is a deadly thing to
young men, when such beastly queans,
shall, with words and carriages that
are openly tempting, discover themselves

unto them; It is hard for such
to escape their Snare.
Wise. That is true, therefore the
Wise mans counsel is the best:  Come
not near the door of her house; for
they are (as you say) very tempting,
as is seen by her in the Proverbs.
I looked (says the Wise man) through 
my casement, and beheld among the
simple ones, I discerned a young man
void of understanding, passing through
the streets near her corner, and he went
the way to her house: In the twilight,
in the evening, in the black and dark
night. And behold, there met him a
Woman with the attire of an harlot,
and subtle of heart; (*Signs of a whore. she is loud
and stubborn, her feet abide not in
her house. Now she is without, now
she is in the street, and lieth in wait
at every corner.) So she caught him,
and kiss'd him, and with an impudent
face said unto him: I have
peace-offerings with me; this day
have I payed my vows. Therefore
came I forth to meet thee, diligently
to seek thy face, and I have found
thee. I have decked my bed with
coverings of Tapestry, with carved
works, with fine Linnen of Ægype:

I have perfumed my bed with Myrrhe,
Aloes, and Cinnamon; come let us take
our fill of love untill the Morning,
let us solace our selves with loves.
Here was a bold Beast: And indeed,
the very eyes, hands, words and
ways of such, are all snares and bands
to youthful, lustful fellows: And
with these was young Badman greatly
snared.
Atten.The sin of Uncleanness cried out against. This sin of Uncleanness is
mightily cried out against both by
Moses, the Prophets, Christ, and his
Apostles; and yet, as we see, for
all that, how men run headlong to
it!
Wise. You have said the truth,
and I will adde, that God, to hold
men back from so filthy a sin, has
set such a stamp of his Indignation
upon it, and commanded such evil
effects to follow it, that were not
they that use it bereft of all Fear of
God, and love to their own health,
they could not but stop and be afraid
to commit it. For, besides
the eternal Damnation that doth attend
such in the next world, (for
these have no Inheritance in the
Kingdom of Christ and of God

Ephes. 5.) the evil effects thereof
in this world are dreadfull.
Atten. Pray shew me some of them,
that as occasion offereth it self, I
may shew them to others for their
good.
Wise. So I will. *What evils attend this sin. 1. It bringeth
a man (as was said of the sin before)
to want and poverty; for by
means of a Whorish woman, a man is
brought to a piece of bread.  The reason
is, for that an Whore will not
yield without hire; and men when
the Devil and Lust is in them, and
God and his Fear far away from
them, will not stick, so they may
accomplish their desire, to lay their
Signet,  their Bracelets, and their
Stuff to pledge, rather than miss of
the fulfilling of their lusts. 2. Again,
by this sin men diminish their
strength, and bring upon themselves,
even upon the Body, a multitude
of Diseases. This King Lemuel's
Mother warned him of. What my
Son,  said she, and what the son of my
womb, and what the Son of my Vows:
Give not thy strength unto women,
nor thy ways to that which destroyeth
Kings. This sin is destructive to

the Body. Give me leave to tell
you another story. *A Story for unclean persons to take notice of. &rhand;I have heard 
of a great man that was a very unclean
person, and he had lived so
long in that sin, that he had almost
lost his sight. So his Physicians
were sent for, to whom he told his
Disease; but they told him, that
they could do him no good, unless
he would forbear his Women. Nay
then, said he, farewell sweet Sight.
Whence observe, that this sin, as
I said, is destructive to the Body;
and also, that some men be so in
love therewith, that they will have
it, though it destroy their body.
Atten. Paul says also, that he that
sins this sin, sins against his own
Body. But what of that? he that
will run the hazard of eternal Damnation
of his Soul, but he will commit
this sin, will for it run the hazard
of destroying his Body. If young Badman
feared not the Damnation of his
Soul, do you think that the consideration
of impairing of his Body, would
have deterred him therefrom?
Wise. You say true. But yet,
methinks, there are still such bad
effects follow, often, upon the commission

of it, that if men would consider
them, it would put, at least, a
stop to their career therein.
Atten. What other evil effects attends
this sin.
Wise.More evils attend this sin. Outward shame and disgrace,
and that in these particulars:
First, There often follows this
foul sin, the Foul Disease, now called
by us the Pox. A disease so nauseous
and stinking, so infectious to the
whole body (and so intailed to this
sin) that hardly are any common
with unclean Women, but they
have more or less a touch of it to
their shame.
&rhand; Atten. That is a foul disease indeed:
I knew a man once that rotted
away with it; and another that had
his Nose eaten off, and his Mouth
almost quite sewed up thereby.
Wise. It is a Disease, that where
it is, it commonly declares, that
the cause thereof is Uncleanness.
It declares to all that behold such a
man, that he is an odious, a beastly,
unclean person. This is that strange
punishment that Job speaks of, that
is appointed to seize on these workers
of Iniquity. 

Atten. Then it seems you think
that the strange punishment that Job
there speaks of, should be the foul
disease.
Wise. I have thought so indeed,
and that for this reason: We see
that this Disease is entailed as I
may say, to this most beastly sin,
nor is there any disease so entailed
to any other sin, as this to this.
That this is the sin to which the
strange Punishment is entailed, you
will easily perceive when you read
the Text. I made a covenant with
mine eyes, said Job, why should I
think upon a Maid? For what portion
is there (for that sin) from above,
and what Inheritance of the Almighty
from on high? And then he answers
himself; Is not destruction to the
wicked, and a strange punishment to
the workers of iniquity? This strange
Punishment is the Pox.
Also I think that this foul Disease
is that which Solomon intends, when
he saith, (speaking of this unclean
and beastly creature) A wound and 
dishonour shall he get, and his reproach
shall not be turned away. A
Punishment Job calls it, a Wound

and Dishonour, Solomon calls it; and
they both do set it as a Remark
upon this sin; Job calling it a
strange punishment, and Solomon a
reproach that shall not be turned away
from them that are common in it.
Atten. What other things follow
upon the commission of this beastly
sin?
Wise. Why, often-times it is
attended with Murder, with the
murder of the Babe begotten on the
defiled bed. How common it is
for the Bastard-getter and Bastard-bearer,
to consent together to murder
their Children, will be better
known at the day of Judgement;
yet something is manifest now.
&rhand; I will tell you another story. An
ancient man, one of mine acquaintance,
a man of good credit in our
Countrey, had a Mother that was a
Midwife: who was mostly imployed
in laying great persons. To this
womans house, upon a time, comes
a brave young Gallant on horseback,
to fetch her to lay a young
Lady. So she addresses her self to
go with him; wherefore, he takes
her up behind him, and away they

ride in the night. Now they had
not rid far, but the Gentleman litt
off his horse, and taking the old
Midwife in his arms from the horse,
turned round with her several times,
and then set her up again; then he
got up, and away they went till
they came at a stately house, into
which he had her, and so into a
Chamber where the young Lady
was in her paius: He then bid the
Midwife do her Office, and she demanded
help, but he drew out his
Sword and told her, if she did not
make speed to do her Office without,
she must look for nothing but
death. Well, to be short, this old
Midwife laid the young Lady, and
a fine sweet Babe she had; Now
there was made in a Room hard by,
a very great Fire: so the Gentleman
took up the Babe, went and
drew the coals from the stock, cast
the Child in, and covered it up, and
there was an end of that. So when
the Midwife had done her work, he
paid her well for her pains, but shut
her up in a dark room all day, and
when night came, took her up behind
him again, and carried her away,

till she came almost at home; then
he turned her round, and round, as
he did before, and had her to her
house, set her down, bid her Farewell,
and away he went: And she
could never tell who it was.
This Story the Midwifes son, who
was a Minister, told me; and also
protested that his mother told it him
for a truth.
Atten. Murder doth often follow
indeed, as that which is the fruit of
this sine but sometimes God brings
even these Adulterers, and Adulteresses
to shameful ends. I heard of
&rhand; one, (I think, a Doctor of Physick)
and his Whore, who had had three
or four Bastards betwixt them, and
had murdered them all, but at last
themselves were hanged for it, in or
near to Colchester. It came out after
this manner: The Whore was so afflicted
in her conscience about it, that
she could not be quiet untill she had
made it known: Thus God many times
makes the actors of wickedness their
own accusers, and brings them by
their own tongues to condigne punishment
for their own sins.
Wise. There has been many such

instances, but we will let that pass.
I was once in the presence of a Woman,
a married woman, that lay
sick of the sickness whereof she
died; and being smitten in her conscience
for the sin of Uncleanness,
which she had often committed with
other men, I heard her (as she lay
upon her Bed) cry out thus: &rhand; I am
a Whore, and all my Children are
Bastards: And I must go to Hell for
my sin; and look, there stands the
Devil at my beds feet to receive my
Soul when I die.
Atten. These are sad storyes, tell
no more of them now, but if you please
shew me yet some other of the evil effects
of this beastly sin.
Wise. This sin is such a snare to
the Soul, that unless a miracle of
Grace prevents, it unavoidably perishes
in the enchanting and bewitching
pleasures of it. This is
manifest by these, and such like
Texts.
The Adulteress will hunt for the 
precious life. Whoso committeth adultery
with a woman, lacketh understanding,
and he that doth it destroys 
his own soul. An Whore is a deep

ditch,  and a strange woman is a
narrow pit. Her house inclines to
death, and her pathes unto the dead.
None that go in unto her return again,
neither take they hold of the
path of life.  She hath cast down
many wounded; yea many strong men
have been slain by her, her house is the
way to Hell, going down to the Chambers
of Death.
Atten. These are dreadful sayings,
and do shew the dreadful state of
those that are guilty of this sin.
Wise. Verily so they doe. But
yet that which makes the whole
more dreadful, is, That men are
given up to this sin, because they
are abhorred of God, and because
abhorred, therefore they shall fall
into the commission of it; and shall
live there. The mouth (that is, the
flattering Lips) of a strange woman
is a deep pit,  the abhorred of the Lord
shall fall therein. Therefore it saith
again of such, that they have none
Inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ 
and of God.
Atten. Put all together, and it is
a dreadful thing to live and die in
this transgression.

Wise. True. But suppose, that instead
of all these Judgments, this sin
had attending of it all the felicities
of this life, and no bitterness, shame,
or disgrace mixed with it, yet one
hour in Hell will spoil all. O!
this Hell, Hell-fire, Damnation in
Hell, it is such an inconceivable punishment,
that were it but throughly
believed, it would nip this sin, with
others, in the head. But here is the
mischief, those that give up themselves
to these things, do so harden
themselves in Unbelief and Atheism
about the things, the punishments that
God hath threatned to inflict upon
the committers of them, that at last
they arrive to, almost, an absolute
and firm belief that there is no Judgment
to come hereafter: Else they
would not, they could not, no not
attempt to commit this sin, by such
abominable language as some do.
I heard of one that should say to
his Miss, when he tempted her to
the committing of this sin, &rhand; If thou
wilt venture thy Body, I will venture
my Soul.Desperate words. And I my self heard another
say, when he was tempting of
a Maid to commit uncleanness with

him, (it was in Olivers dayes) That
if she did prove with Child, he
would tell her how she might escape
punishment, (and that was then
somewhat severe,) Say (saith he)
when you come before the Judge,
&rhand; That you are with Child by the Holy
Ghost. I heard him say thus, and
it greatly afflicted me; I had a
mind to have accused him for it
before some Magistrate; but he
was a great man, and I was poor,
and young: so I let it alone, but it
troubled me very much.
Atten. 'Twas the most horrible
thing that ever I heard in my life.
But how far off are these men from
that Spirit and Grace that dwelt in
Joseph!
Wise.  Right; when Joseph's Mistress
tempted him,Of chaste Joseph. yea tempted
him daily; yea, she laid hold on
him, and said with her Whores
forehead, Come lie with me, but he
refused: He hearkned not to lie
with her, or to be with her. Mr.
Badman would have taken the opportunity.
And a little to comment upon
this of Joseph.

1. Here is a Miss, a great Miss,
the Wife of the Captain of the
Guard, some beautiful Dame, I'le
warrant you.
2. Here is a Miss won, and in
her whorish Affections come over
to Joseph, without his speaking of
a word.
3. Here is her unclean Desire
made known; Come lie with me,
said she.
4. Here was a fit opportunity.
There was none of the men of the
house there within.
5. Joseph was a young man, full
of strength, and therefore the more
in danger to be taken.
6. This was to him, a Temptation,
from her, that lasted days.
7. And yet Joseph refused, 1. Her
daily Temptation; 2. Her daily
Solicitation: 3. Her daily Provocation,
heartily, violently and constantly.
For when she caught him
by the Garment, saying, Lie with
me, he left his Garment in her hand,
and gat him out. Ay, and although
contempt, treachery, slander, accusation,
imprisonment, and danger of
death followed, (for an Whore careth

not what mischief she does,
when she cannot have her end) yet
Joseph will not defile himself, sin
against God, and hazard his own
eternal salvation.
Atten. Blessed Joseph! I would
thou hadst more fellows!
Wise. Mr. Badman has more fellows
than Joseph, else there would
not be so many Whores as there
are: For though I doubt not but that
that Sex is bad enough this way,
yet I verily believe that many of
them are made Whores at first by
the flatteries of Badmans fellows.
Alas!Many are made whores by promises of Marriage, &c. there is many a woman plunged
into this sin at first even by promises
of Marriage. I say, by these
promises they are flattered, yea,
forced into a consenting to these
Villanies, and so being in, and
growing hardened in their hearts,
they at last give themselves up, even
as wicked men do, to act this kind
of wickedness with greediness. But
Joseph you see, was of another
mind, for the Fear of God was in
him.
I will, before I leave this, tell you
here two notable storyes; and I

wish Mr. Badmans companions may
hear of them. They are found in
Clarks Looking-glass for Sinners; and
are these.
Mr. Cleaver (says Mr. Clark) reports
of one whom he knew,  that had
committed the act of Uncleanness,
whereupon he fell into such horror
of Conscience that he hanged himself;
leaving it thus written in a paper.
Indeed, (saith he) I acknowledge
it to be utterly unlawful for a
man to kill himself, but I am bound to
act the Magistrates part, because
the punishment of this sin is death.
Clark doth also in the same page
make mention of two more, who
as they were committing Adultery
in London, were immediately struck
dead with fire from Heaven, in the
very Act. Their bodyes were so
found, half burnt up, and sending
out a most loathsom savour.
Atten. These are notable storyes indeed.
Wise. So they are, and I suppose
they are as true as notable.
Atten. Well, but I wonder, if
young Badmans Master knew him to
be such a Wretch, that he would suffer
him in his house.

Wise. They liked one another
even as *Badman and his Master abhor one another. fire and water doe.
Young Badmans wayes were odious
to his Master, and his Masters wayes
were such as young Badman could
not endure. Thus in these two,
was fulfilled that saying of the Holy
Ghost:  An unjust man is an abomination
to the just, and he that is upright
in the way is abomination to the
wicked.
The good mans wayes, Mr. Badman
could not abide, nor could the
good man abide the bad wayes of
his base Apprentice. Yet would his
Master, if he could, have kept him,
and also have learnt him his trade.
Atten. If he could! why he might,
if he would, might he not?
Wise.Young Badman runs away from his Master. Alas, Badman ran away
from him once and twice, and would
not at all be ruled. So the next time
he did run away from him, he did
let him go indeed. For he gave him
no occasion to run away, except it
was by holding of him as much as he
could (and that he could do but little)
to good and honest rules of life.
And had it been ones own case, one
should have let him go. For what

should a man do, that had either
regard to his own Peace, his Childrens
Good, or the preservation of
the rest of his servants from evil, but
let him go? Had he staid, the house
of Correction had been most fit for
him, but thither his Master was loth
to send him, because of the love that
he bore to his Father. An house of
correction, I say, had been the fittest
place for him, but his Master let him
go.
Atten. He ran away, you say, but
whither did he run?
Wise. Why,He gets a new Master like himself. to one of his own
trade, and also like himself. Thus
the wicked joyned hand in hand,
and there he served out his time.
Atten. Then, sure, he had his
hearts desire, when he was with one so
like himself.
Wise. Yes. So he had, but God
gave it him in his anger.
Atten. How do you mean?
Wise. I mean as before,A sign of Gods anger upon young Badman. that for a
wicked man to be by the Providence
of God, turned out of a good mans
doors, into a wicked mans house to
dwell, is a sign of the Anger of God.
For God by this, and such Judgements,

says thus to such an one:
Thou wicked one, thou lovest not me,
my wayes, nor my people; Thou castest
my Law and good Counsel behinde
thy back: Come, I will dispose of thee
in my wrath; thou shalt be turned
over to the ungodly, thou shalt be put
to school to the Devil, I will leave
thee to sink and swim in sin, till I shall
visit thee with Death and Judgment.
This was therefore another Judgment
that did come upon this young
Badman.
Atten. You have said the truth, for
God by such a Judgment as this, in effect
says so indeed; for he takes them
out of the hand of the just, and binds
them up in the hand of the wicked, and
whither they then shall be carried, a
man may easily imagin.
Wise.Demonstration of Gods anger towards him. It is one of the saddest tokens
of Gods anger that happens to
such kind of persons: And that for
several reasons.
1. Such an one, by this Judgment,
is put out out of the way, and
from under the means which ordinarily
are made use of to do good to
the soul.  For a Family where Godliness
is professed, and practised, is

Gods Ordinance, the place which he
has appointed to teach young ones
the way and fear of God. Now to
be put out of such a Family into a
bad, a wicked one, as Mr. Badman
was, must needs be in Judgment,
and a sign of the anger of God. For
in ungodly Families men learn to
forget God, to hate goodness, and
to estrange themselves from the
wayes of those that are good.
2. In Bad Families, they have
continually fresh Examples, and also
incitements to evil, and fresh encouragements
to it too. Yea moreover,
in such places evil is commended,
praised, well-spoken of, and they
that do it, are applauded; and this,
to be sure, is a drowning Judgement.
3. Such places are the very haunts
and Walks of the infernal Spirits,
who are continually poysoning the
Cogitations and Minds of one or
other in such Families, that they may
be able to poyson others. Therefore
observe it, usually in wicked Families,
some one, or two, are more
arch for wickedness then are any
other that are there. Now such

are Satans Conduit-pipes; for by
them he conveighs of the spawn of
Hell, through their being crafty
in wickedness, into the Ears and
Souls of their Companions. Yea,
and when they have once conceived
wickedness, they travel with it, as
doth a woman with Child, till they
have brought it forth; Behold, he
travelleth with iniquity,  and hath conceived
mischief, and brought forth
falshood. Some men, as here is intimated
in the Text, and as was
hinted also before, have a kind of
mystical, but hellish copulation with
the Devil, who is the Father, and
their Soul the Mother of sin and wickedness;
and they, so soon as they
have conceived by him,  finish, by
bringing forth sin, both it, and their
own damnation.
Atten. *It concerns Parents to put their Children into good Families. How much then doth it
concern those Parents that love their
Children, to see, that if they go from
them, they be put into such Families
as be good, that they may learn there
betimes to eschew evil, and to follow
that which is good?
Wise. It doth concern them indeed;
and it doth also concern

them *Masters should also beware what Servants they entertain. that take Children into their
Families, to take heed what Children
they receive. For a man may
soon by a bad Boy, be dammaged
both in his Name, Estate, and Family,
and also hindred in his Peace
and peaceable pursuit after God and
godliness; I say, by one such Vexmin
as a wicked and filthy Apprentice.
Atten. True, for one Sinner destroyeth
much good, and a poor man
is better than a Lier. But many
times a man cannot help it; for such
as at the beginning promise very fair,
are by a little time proved to be very
Rogues, like young Badman.
Wise. That is true also, but when
a man has done the best he can to
help it, he may with the more confidence
expect the Blessing of God
to follow, or he shall have the more
peace, if things go contrary to his
desire.
Atten. Well, but did Mr. Badman
and his Master agree so well?
I mean his last Master, since they
were Birds of a Feather, I mean,
since they were so well met for wickedness.

Wise.Young Badman and his second Master cannot agree. This second Master, was,
as before I told you, bad enough,
but yet he would often fall out with
young Badman his Servant, and
chide, yea and sometimes beat him
too, for his naughty doings.
Atten. What! for all he was so
bad himself! This is like the Proverb,
The Devil corrects Vice.
Wise. I will assure you, 'tis as I say.
For you must know, that Badmans
wayes suited not with his Masters
gains. Could he have done as the
Damsel that we read of Acts 16. 
did, to wit, fill his Masters Purse
with his badness, he had certainly
been his White-boy, but it was not
so with young Badman; and therefore,
though his Master and he did
suit well enough in the main, yet
in this and that point they differed.
†Reasons of their disagreeing. Young Badman was for neglecting
of his Masters business, for going
to the Whore-house, for beguiling
of his Master, for attempting to debauch
his Daughters, and the like:
No marvel then if they disagreed
in these points. Not so much for
that his Master had an antipathy against
the fact it self, for he could

do so when he was an Apprentice;
but for that his servant by his sin
made spoil of his Commodities, &c.
and so damnified his Master.
Had (as I said before) young
Badmans wickedness, had only a
tendency to his Masters advantage;
as could he have sworn, lied, cousened,
cheated, and defrauded customers
for his Master, (and indeed
sometimes he did so) but had that
been all that he had done, he had
not had, no not a wry word from
his Master: But this was not always
Mr. Badmans way.
Atten. That was well brought in,
even the Maid that we read of in the
Acts, and the distinction was as clear
betwixt the wickedness, and wickedness
of servants.
Wise. Alas! men that are wicked
themselves, yet greatly hate it
in others, not simply because it is
wickedness, but because it opposeth
their interest. Do you think
that that Maids master would have
been troubled at the loss of her, if
he had not lost, with her, his gain:
No, I'le warrant you; she might
have gone to the Devil for him:

But when her master saw that the
hope of his gain was gone,  then, then
he fell to persecuting Paul. But Mr.
Badmans master did sometimes lose
by Mr. Badmans sins, and then Badman
and his master were at odds.
Atten. Alas poor Badman! Then
it seems thou couldest not at all times
please thy like.
Wise. No, he could not, and the
reason I have told you.
Atten. But do not bad Masters
condemn themselves in condemning the
badness of their servants.
Wise.  Yes; in that they condemn
that in another which they either
have,Bad Masters condemn themselves when they for badness beat their Bad servants. or do allow in themselves. And
the time will come, when that very
sentence that hath gone out of their
own mouths against the sins of
others, themselves living and taking
pleasure in the same, shall return
with violence upon their own pates.
The Lord pronounced Judgment
against Baasha,  as for all his evils in
general, so for this in special, because
he was like the hous: of Jeroboam,
and yet killed him. This is Mr. Badmans
Masters case, he is like his man,
and yet he beats him. He is like

his man, and yet he rails at him for
being bad.
Atten. But why did not young Badman
run away from this Master, as
he ran away from the other?
Wise.Why young Badman did not run away from this Master though he did beat him. He did not. And if I be
not mistaken, the reason why, was
this. There was Godliness in the
house of the first, and that young
Badman could not endure. For fare,
for lodging, for work, and time,
he had better, and more by this Masters
allowance, than ever he had by
his last; but all this would not content,
because Godliness was promoted
there. He could not abide this
praying, this reading of Scriptures,
and hearing, and repeating of Sermons:
he could not abide to be told
of his transgressions in a sober and
Godly manner.
Atten. There is a great deal in the
Manner of reproof, wicked men both
can, and cannot abide to hear their
transgressions spoken against.
Wise.Why Badman could hear his last Masters reproof better than he could the first. There is a great deal of difference
indeed. This last Master of
Mr. Badmans, would tell Mr. Badman
of his sins in Mr. Badmans
own dialect; he would swear, and

curse, and damn, when he told him
of his sins, and this he could bear
better, than to be told of them after
a godly sort. Besides, that last Master
would, when his passions and rage
was over, laugh at and make merry
with the sins of his servant Badman:
And that would please young
Badman well. Nothing offended
Badman but blows, and those he had
but few of now, because he was pretty
well grown up. For the most part
when his Master did rage and swear,
he would give him Oath for Oath,
and Curse for Curse, at least secretly,
let him go on as long as he
would.
Atten. This was hellish living.
Wise.By what means Badman came to be compleated in his wickedness. 'Twas hellish living indeed:
And a man might say, that with
this Master, young Badman compleated
himself yet more and more
in wickedness, as well as in his trade:
for by that he came out of his time,
what with his own inclination to sin,
what with his acquaintance with his
three companions, and what with this
last Master, and the wickedness he
saw in him; he became a sinner in
grain. I think he had a Bastard laid

to his charge before he came out of
his time.
Atten. Well,Badman out of his time. but it seems he did
live to come out of his time, but what
did he then?
Wise. Why, he went home to
his Father, and he like a loving and
tender-hearted Father received him
into his house.
Atten. And how did he carry it
there?
Wise.He goes home to his Father. Why, the reason why he
went home, was, for Money to set
up for himself, he staied but a little
at home, but that little while that he
did stay, he refrained himself as well
he could,He refrains himself for Money. and did not so much discover
himself to be base, for fear his
Father should take distaste, and so
should refuse, or for a while forbear
to give him money.
Yet even then he would have his
times, and companions, and the fill
of his lusts with them, but he used
to blind all with this, he was glad to
see his old acquaintance, and they as
glad to see him, and he could not in
civility but accomodate them with a
bottle or two of Wine, or a dozen or
two of Drink.

Atten. And did the old man give
him money to set up with?
Wise. Yes, above two hundred
pounds.
Atten. Therein, I think, the old
man was out. Had I been his Father,
I would have held him a little at
staves-end, till I had had far better
proof of his manners to be good; (for
I perceive that his Father did know
what a naughty boy he had been, both
by what he used to do at home,Severity what it inclines to. and because
he changed a good Master for a
bad, &c.) He should not therefore
have given him money so soon. What
if he had pinched a little, and gone
to Journey-work for a time, that he
might have known what a penny was,
by his earning of it? Then, in all probability,
he had known better how to
have spent it: Yea, and by that time
perhaps, have better considered with
himself, how to have lived in the
world. Ay, and who knows but he
might have come to himself with the
Prodigal, and have asked God and
his Father forgiveness for the villanies
that he had committed against them.
Wise. If his Father could also have
blessed this manner of dealing to

him, and have made it effectual for
the ends that you have propounded;
then I should have thought as you.
But alas, alas, you talk as if you never
knew, or had at this present forgot
what the bowels and compassions ofWe are better at giving then taking good Counsel.
a Father are. Why did you not
serve your own son so? But 'tis evident
enough, that we are better at
giving good counsel to others, than
we are at taking good counsel ourselves.
But mine honest neighbour,
suppose that Mr. Badmans Father
had done as you say, and by so doing
had driven his son to ill courses,
what had he bettered either himself
or his son in so doing?
Atten. That's true, but it doth not
follow, that if the Father had done
as I said, the son would have done
as you suppose. But if he had done as
you have supposed,This is to be considered. what had he done
worse than what he hath done already?
Wise. He had done bad enough,
thats' true. But suppose his Father
had given him no Money, and suppose
that young Badman had taken a
pett thereat, and in an anger had
gone beyond Sea, and his Father

had neither seen him, nor heard of
him more. Or suppose that of a mad
and headstrong stomach he had gone
to the High-way for money, and so
had brought himself to the Gallows,
and his Father and Family to great
contempt, or if by so doing he had
not brought himself to that end, yet
he had added to all his wickedness,
such and such evils besides: And
what comfort could his Father have
had in this?
Besides, when his Father had done
for him what he could, with desire
to make him an honest man, he
would then, whether his son had
proved honest or no, have laid
down his head with far more peace,
than if he had taken your Counsel.
Atten. Nay I think I should not
a been forward to have given advice
in the cause; but truly you have given
me such an account of his villanies,
that the hearing thereof has made me
angry with him.
Wise. In an angry mood we
may soon out-shoot ourselves, but
poor wretch, as he is, he is gone to
his place. But, as I said, when a
good Father hath done what he can

for a bad Child, and that Child shall
prove never the better, he will lie
down with far more peace, than if
through severity, he had driven him
to inconveniencies.
I remember that I have heard of a
good woman, that had (as this old
man) a bad and ungodly *A good woman and her bad son. son, and
she prayed for him, counselled him,
and carried it Motherly to him for
several years together; but still he
remained bad. At last, upon a
time, after she had been at prayer,
as she was wont, for his conversion,
she comes to him, and thus, or to
this effect, begins again to admonish
him. Son, said she, Thou hast been
and art a wicked Child, thou hast cost
me many a prayer and tear, and yet
thou remainest wicked. Well, I have
done my duty, I have done what I
can to save thee; now I am satisfied,
that if I shall see thee damned at the
day of Judgment, I shall be so far off
from being grieved for thee, that I
shall rejoyce to hear the sentence of thy
damnation at that day: And it converted
him.
I tell you, that if Parents carry it
lovingly towards their Children,

mixing their Mercies with loving
Rebukes, and their loving Rebukes
with Fatherly and Motherly Compassions,
they are more likely to
save their Children, than by being
churlish and severe toward them:
but if they do not save them, if
their mercy doth them no good, yet
it will greatly ease them at the day
of death, to consider; I have done
by love as much as I could, to save
and deliver my child from Hell.
Atten. Well I yield. But pray let
us return again to Mr. Badman:
You say, that his Father gave him a
piece of money that he might set up for
himself.
Wise. Yes, his Father did give
him a piece of money, and he did set
up,Mr. Badman sets up for himself, and quickly runs to the lands end. and almost as soon set down again:
for he was not long set up,
but by his ill managing of his matters
at home, together with his extravagant
expences abroad, he was got so
far into debt, and had so little in
his shop to pay, that he was hard put
to it to keep himself out of prison.
But when his Creditors understood
that he was about to marry, and in
a fair way to get a rich Wife, they

said among themselves, We will not
be hasty with him, if he gets a rich
Wife he will pay us all.
Atten. But how could he so quickly
run out, for I perceive 'twas in little
time, by what you say?
Wise. 'Twas in little time indeed,
I think he was not above two years
and an half in doing of it: but the
reason is apparent;The reason of his runing out. for he being a
wild young man, and now having
the bridle loose before him, and being
wholly subjected to his lusts and
vices, he gave himself up to the way
of his heart, and to the sight of his
eye, forgetting that for all these things
God will bring him to Judgment; 
and he that doth thus, you may be
sure, shall not be able long to stand
on his leggs.
Besides, he had now an addition
of *New companions. new companions; companions
you must think, most like himself
in Manners, and so such that cared
not who sunk, if they themselves
might swim. These would often
be haunting of him, and of his shop
too when he was absent. They
would commonly egg him to the
Ale house, but yet make him Jack-pay-for-all;

They would be borrowing
also money of him, but take no
care to pay again, except it was
with more of their company, which
also he liked very well; and so his
poverty came like one that travelleth,
and his want like an armed man.
But all the while they studied hisMr. Badmans temper.
temper; he loved to be flattered,
praised and commended for Wit,
Manhood and Personage; and this
was like stroking him over the face.
Thus they Collogued with him, and
got yet more and more into him,
and so (like Horse-leaches) they
drew away that little that his father
had given him, and brought him
quickly down, almost to dwell next
dore to the begger.
Atten.  Then was the saying of the
wise man fulfilled, He that keepeth
company with harlots, and a companion
of fools, shall be destroyed.
Wise. Ay, and that too, A companion
of riotous persons shameth his 
father; For he, poor man, had
both grief and shame, to see how
his son (now at his own hand) behaved
himself in the enjoyment of
those good things, in and under the

lawfull use of which he might have
lived to Gods glory, his own comfort,
and credit among his neighbours.
But he that followeth vain 
persons, shall have poverty enough.
The way that he took, led him directly
into this condition; for who
can expect other things of one that
follows such courses? Besides, when
he was in his Shop, he could not abide
to be doing; He was naturally
given to Idleness: He loved to live
high, but his hands refused to labour;
and what else can the end of such an
one be, but that which the wise man
saith?  The Drunkard and the Glutton
shall come to poverty, and drowsiness
shall cloath a man with rags.
Atten. But now, methinks, when
he was brought thus low, he should
have considered the hand of God that
was gone out against him, and should
have smote upon the breast, and have
returned.
Wise.His Behaviour under his decays. Consideration, good consideration
was far from him, he was
as stout and proud now, as ever in
all his life, and was as high too in
the pursuit of his sin, as when he
was in the midst of his fulness; only

he went now like a tyred Jade, the
Devil had rid him almost off of his
leggs.
Atten. Well, but what did he do
when all was almost gone?
Wise.How he covered his decayes. Two things were now his
play. 1. He bore all in hand by
Swearing, and Cracking and Lying,
that he was as well to pass, as he
was the first day he set up for himself,
yea that he had rather got
than lost; and he had at his beck
some of his Companions that would
swear to confirm it as fast as he.
Atten. This was double wickedne&esset;,
'twas a sin to say it, and another to
swear it.
Wise. That's true, but what evil
is that that he will not doe, that is
left of God, as I believe Mr. Badman
was?
Atten. And what was the other
thing?
Wise.Badman is for a rich Wife. Why, that which I hinted
before, he was for looking out for
a rich Wife: and now I am come
to some more of his invented, devised,
designed, and abominable Roguery,
such that will yet declare him
to be a most desperate sinner.

The thing was this: A Wife he
wanted, or rather Money; for as
for a woman, he could have Whores
enow at his whistle. But, as I said,
he wanted Money, and that must
be got by a Wife,Badman has a godly Maid in his eye. or no way; nor
could he so easily get a Wife neither,
except he became an Artist
at the way of dissembling; nor
would dissembling do among that
people that could dissemble as well
as he.He seeks to get her, why, and how. But there dwelt a Maid not
far from him, that was both godly,
and one that had a good Portion,
but how to get her, there lay all the
craft. Well, he calls a Council of
some of his most trusty and cunningHe calls his Companions together, and they advise him how to get her.
Companions, and breaks his
mind to them; to wit, that he had
a mind to marry: and he also told
them to whom; But, said he, how
shall I accomplish my end, she is
Religious, and I am not? Then
one of them made reply, saying,
Since she is Religious, you must pretend
to be so likewise, and that for
some time before you go to her:
Mark therefore whither she goes
daily to hear, and do you go thither
also; but there you must be sure to

behave your self soberly, and make
as if you liked the Word wonderful
well; stand also where she may
see you, and when you come home,
be sure that you walk the street very
soberly, and go within sight of her:
This done for a while, then go to
her, and first talk of how sorry
you are for your sins, and shew great
love to the Religion that she is of;
still speaking well of her Preachers
and of her godly acquaintance, bewailing
your hard hap, that it was
not your lot to be acquainted with
her and her fellow-Professors sooner;
and this is the way to get her. Also
you must write down Sermons, talk
of Scriptures, and protest that you
came a wooing to her, only because
she is Godly, and because you should
count it your greatest happiness if
you might but have such an one:
As for her Money, slight it, it will
be never the further off, that's the
way to come soonest at it, for she
will be jealous at first that you come
for her Money; you know what
she has, but make not a word about
it. Do this, and you shall see if you
do not intangle the Lass.

Thus was the snare laid for this
poor honest Maid, and she was quickly
catched in his pit.
Atten. Why, did he take this counsel?
Wise.Badman goes to the Damosel as his Counsel advised him Did he! yes, and after a
while, went as boldly to her, and
that under a Vizzard of Religion,
as if he had been for Honesty and
Godliness, one of the most sincere
and upright-hearted in England. He
observed all his points, and followed
the advice of his Counsellers,
and quickly obtained her too;
for natural parts he had, he was tall,
and fair, and had plain, but very
good Cloaths on his back; and his
Religion was the more easily attained;
for he had seen something
in the house of his Father, and first
Master, and so could the more readily
put himself into the Form and
Shew thereof.
So he appointed his day,Badmans complement, his lying complement. and went
to her, as that he might easily do, for
she had neither father nor mother to
oppose. Well, when he was come,
and had given her a civil Complement,
to let her understand why he
was come, then he began and told

her, That he had found in his heart
a great deal of love to her Person;
and that, of all the Damosels in the
world he had pitched upon her, if she
thought fit, to make her his beloved
wife. The reasons, as he told her,
why he had pitched upon her were,
her Religious and personal Excellencies;
and therefore intreated her to
take his condition into her tender
and loving consideration. As for the
world, quoth he, I have a very good
trade, and can maintain my self and
Family well, while my wife sits still
on her seat; I have got thus, and thus
much already, and feel money come
in every day, but that is not the thing
that I aim at, 'tis an honest and godly
Wife. Then he would present her
with a good Book or two, pretending
how much good he had got by
them himself. He would also be
often speaking well of godly Ministers,
especially of those that he perceived
she liked, and loved most. Besides,
he would be often telling of
her, what a godly Father he had, and
what a new man he was also become
himself; and thus did this treacherous
Dealer, deal with this honest and

good Girl, to her great grief and sorrow,
as afterward you shall hear.
Atten. But had the maid no friend
to looke after her?
Wise. Her Father and Mother
were dead, and that he knew well
enough, and so she was the more
easily overcome by his naughty lying
tongue. But if she had never
so many friends,Neglect of Counsel about marriage dangerous she might have
been beguiled by him. It is too much
the custom of young people now, to
think themselves wise enough to
make their own Choyce, and that
they need not ask counsel of those
that are older and also wiser then
they: but this is a great fault in
them, and many of them have paid
dear for it. Well, to be short, in
little time Mr. Badman obtains his
desire, gets this honest Girl and her
money, is married to her, brings
her home,Badman obtains his desire, is married, &c. makes a Feast, entertains
her royally, but her Portion must
pay for all.
Atten. This was wonderfull deceitfull
doings, a man shall seldom hear of
the like.
Wise. By this his doing, he shewed
how little he feared God, and

what little dread he had of his Judgments.
For all this carriage,His carriage judged ungodly and wicked. and
all these words were by him premeditated
evil, he knew he lyed, he
knew he dissembled; yea, he knew
that he made use of the name of
God, of Religion, good Men, and
good Books, but as a stalking-Horse,
thereby the better to catch his game.
In all this his glorious pretense of Religion,
he was but a glorious painted
Hypocrite, and hypocrisie is the
highest sin that a poor carnal wretch
can attain unto; it is also a sin that
most dareth God, and that also
bringeth the greater damnation.
Now was he a whited Wall, now
was he a painted Sepulchre; now was
he a grave that appeared not;  for
this poor honest, godly Damosel,
little thought that both her peace,The great alteration that quickly happened to Badmans wife.
and comfort, and estate, and liberty,
and person, and all, were going to
her burial, when she was going to be
married to Mr. Badman; And yet
so it was, she enjoyed her self but
little afterwards; she was as if she
was dead and buried, to what she
enjoyed before.
Atten. Certainly some wonderfull

Judgment of God must attend and
overtake such wicked men as these.
Wise. You may be sure that they
shall have Judgment to the full, for
all these things, when the day of
Judgment is come. But as for Judgment
upon them in this life, it doth
not alwayes come, no not upon
those that are worthy thereof.
They that tempt God are delivered, 
and they that work wickedness are set
up:Expectation of Judgment is for such things. But they are reserved to the
day of wrath, and then for their
wickedness, God will repay them
to their faces. The wicked is reserved
to the day of destruction,Job. 21. 30, 31, 32. they
shall be brought forth to the day of
wrath; who shall declare his way to
his face? and who shall repay him what
he hath done? yet shall he be brought
to the grave, and remain in the tomb.
That is, ordinarily they escape
Gods hand in this life, save only a
few Examples are made, that others
may be cautioned, and take warning
thereby: But at the day of
Judgment they must be rebuked for
their evil with the lashes of devouring
fire.
Atten. Can you give me no examples

of Gods wrath upon men that have
acted this tragical wicked deed of Mr.
Badman.
Wise.An example of Gods anger on such as have heretofore committed this sin of Mr. Badman. Yes; Hamor and Shechem,
and all the men of their City, for attempting
to make God and Religion
the stalking-Horse to get Jacobs
daughters to wife, were together
slain with the edge of the sword.
A Judgment of God upon them,  no
doubt, for their dissembling in that
matter. All manner of lying and
dissembling is dreadfull, but to
make God and Religion a Disguise,
therewith to blind thy Dissimulation
from others eyes, is highly
provoking to the Divine Majesty.
&rhand; I knew one that dwelt not far off
from our Town, that got him a wife
as Mr. Badman got his; but he did
not enjoy her long: for one night as
he was riding home (from his companions,
where he had been at a
neighbouring Town) his horse threw
him to the ground, where he was
found dead at break of day; frightfully
and lamentably mangled with
his fall, and besmeared with his own
blood.

Atten. Well, but pray return again
to Mr. Badman, how did he carry
it to his wife, after he was married
to her?
Wise. Nay, let us take things along
as we go. He had not been
married but a little while, but his
Creditors came upon him for their
money:After Badman is married, his Creditors come upon him, and his wives Portion pays for that which his whores were feasted with before he was married. He deferred them a little
while, but at last things were come
to that point, that pay he must, or
must do worse; so he appointed
them a time, and they came for
their money, and he payed them
down with her money before her
eyes, for those goods that he had
profusely spent among his Whores
long before, (besides the portion
that his Father gave him) to the value
of two hundred pounds.
Atten. This beginning was bad;
but what shall I say? 'twas like Mr.
Badman himself. Poor woman, this
was but a bad beginning for her, I
fear it filled her with trouble enough,
as I think such a beginning would
have done, one, perhaps much stronger
than she.
Wise. Trouble, ay, you may be
sure of it, but now 'twas too late to

repent, she should have looked better
to her self,Now she reaps the Fruits of her unadvisedness. when being wary
would have done her good; her
harms may be an advantage to
others, that will learn to take heed
thereby; but for her self, she must
take what follows, even such a life
now as Mr. Badman her Husband
will lead her, and that will be bad
enough.
Atten. This beginning was bad,
and yet I fear it was but the beginning
of bad.
Wise.Now Badman has got him a wife by Religion, he hangs it by as a thing out of use, and entertains his old Companions. You may be sure, that it
was but the beginning of badness,
for other evils came on apace; as
for instance: it was but a little while
after he was married, but he hangs
his Religion upon the hedge, or
rather dealt with it as men deal
with their old Cloaths, who cast
them off, or leave them to others
to wear, for his part he would be
Religious no longer.
Now therefore he had pulled off
his Vizzard, and began to shew
himself in his old shape, a base, wicked,
debauched fellow, (and now
the poor woman saw that she was
betrayed indeed;) now also his old

Companions begin to flock about
him, and to haunt his house and
Shop as formerly: And who with
them but Mr. Badman? and who
with him again but they?
Now those good people that usedHe drives good company from his wife.
to company with his Wife, began
to be amated and discouraged; also
he would frown and gloat upon
them, as if he abhorred the appearance
of them: so that in little
time he drove all good company
from her, and made her sit solitary
by her self.He goes to his Whores. He also began now to
go out a nights to those Drabs
who were his Familiars before, with
whom he would stay somtimes till
midnight, and then would come home
as drunk as a Swine; and this was
the course of Mr. Badman.
Now, when he came home in
this case, if his wife did but speak
a word to him, about where he
had been, and why he had so abused
himself,He rails at his wife. though her words were spoken
in never so much meekness and
love, then she was Whore, and
Bitch, and Jade; and 'twas well if
she miss'd his fingers and heels.

Sometimes also he would bring his
Puncks home to his house, and wo
be to his wife when they were gone,
if she did not entertain them with
all varieties possible, and also carry
it lovingly to them.
Thus this good woman was made
by Badman her Husband, to possess
nothing but disappointments as to
all that he had promised her, or that
she hoped to have at his hands.
But that that added pressing
weight to all her sorrow,He seeks to force his wife from her Religion. was, that,
as he had cast away all Religion
himself, so he attempted, if possible,
to make her do so too. He would
not suffer her to go out to the Preaching
of the Word of Christ, nor to
the rest of his Appointments, for the
health and salvation of her Soul: he
would now taunt at,He mocks at her Preachers. and reflectingly
speak of her Preachers; and
would receive, yea raise scandals
of them, to her very great grief and
affliction.
Now she scarce durst go to an
honest Neighbours house, or have
a good Book in her hand; specially
when he had his companions in his
house, or had got a little drink in

his head. He would also, when he
perceived that she was dejected,He mocks his wife in her dejections.
speak tauntingly, and mockingly to
her in the presence of his Companions,
calling of her his Religious
Wife, his demure Dame, and the
like; also he would make a sport
of her among his wanton ones abroad.
If she did ask him (as sometimes
she would) to let her go out to aHe refuses to let her go out to good company.
Sermon, he would in a currish manner
reply, Keep at home, keep at
home, and look to your business, we
cannot live by hearing of Sermons.
If she still urged that he would let
her goe, then he would say to her,
Goe if you dare. He would also
charge her with giving of what he
had to her Ministers, when, vile
wretch, he had spent it on his vain
Companions before.
This was the life that Mr. Badmans
good wife lived, within few
months after he had married her.
Atten. This was a disappointment
indeed.
Wise. A disappointment indeed,
as ever, I think, poor woman had.
One would think that the Knave

might a little let her have had her
will, since it was nothing but to be
honest, and since she brought him
so sweet, so lumping a Portion, for
she brought hundreds into his house:
I say, one would think he should
have let her had her own will a
little, since she desired it only in
the Service and Worship of God:
but could she win him to grant her
that? no, not a bit if it would have
saved her life.She gets out sometimes by stealth. True, sometimes
she would steal out when he was
from home, on a Journey, or among
his drunken companions, but with
all privacy imaginable; and, poor
woman, this advantage she had,
she carried it so to all her Neighbours,
that, though many of them
were but carnal, yet they would
not betray her, or tell of her going
out to the Word, if they saw it, but
would rather endeavour to hide it
from Mr. Badman himself.
Atten. This carriage of his to her,
was enough to break her heart.
Wise. It was enough to do it indeed,
yea it did effectually do it.
It killed her in time, yea it was all
the time a killing of her. She would

often-times when she fate by her
self,Her repentance and complaint. thus mournfully bewail her
condition: Wo is me that I sojourn
in Meshech,  and that I dwell in the
tents of Kedar; my soul hath long time
dwelt with him that hateth peace.
O what shall be given unto thee, thou
deceitful tongue? or what shall be
done unto thee, thou false tongue? I
am a Woman grieved in spirit, my
Husband has bought me and sold me
for his lusts: 'Twas not me, but my
Money that he wanted: O that he
had had it, so I had had my liberty!
This she said, not of contempt
of his Person, but of his Conditions,
and because she saw that by his hypocritical
tongue, he had brought
her not only almost to beggery, but
robbed her of the Word of God.
Atten. It is a deadly thing, I see,The evil of being unequally yoaked together.
to be unequally yoaked with Unbelievers.
If this woman had had a
good Husband, how happily might they
have lived together! Such an one
would have prayed for her, taught
her and also would have encouraged
her in the Faith, and ways of God:
But now, poor creature, instead of this,
there is nothing but the quite contrary.

Wise. It is a deadly thing indeed,
and therefore, by the Word of God
his people are forbid to be joyned
in marriage with them.  Be not, saith
it, unequally yoaked together with unbelievers;
for what fellowship hath
righteousness with unrighteousness?
and what communion hath light with
darkness? And what Concord hath
Christ with Belial? or what part
hath he that believeth with an Infidel?
And what agreement hath the Temple
of God with Idols? There can
be no agreement where such Matches
are made, even God himself hath
declared the contrary, from the beginning
of the world. I (says he)
will put enmity betwixt thee and the 
woman, betwixt thy seed and her seed.
Therefore he saith in another place, 
they can mix no better than Iron
and Clay. I say, they cannot agree,
they cannot be one, and therefore
they should be aware at first, and
not lightly receive such into their
affections. God has often made such
Matches bitter, especially to his own.
Such matches are, as God said of
Elie's Sons that were spared, to consume
the eyes, and to grieve the heart.

Oh the wailing, and lamentation
that they have made that have been
thus yoaked, especially if they were
such as would be so yoaked, against
their light, and good counsel to the
contrary.
Atten. Alas! he deluded her with
his tongue, and feigned reformation.
Wise.Good counsel to those godly maids that are to marry. Well, well; she should
have gone more warily to work:
what if she had acquainted some of
her best, most knowing, and godly
friends therewith? what if she had
engaged a Godly Minister or two to
have talked with Mr. Badman?
Also, what if she had laid wait
round about him, to espie if he was
not otherwise behind her back than
he was before her face? And besides,
I verily think (since in the multitude
of Counsellors there is safety) that if
she had acquainted the Congregation
with it, and desired them to spend
some time in prayer to God about
it, and if she must have had him, to
have received him as to his godliness,
upon the Judgment of others,
rather than her own, (she knowing
them to be Godly and Judicious,
and unbiassed men) she had had

more peace all her life after; than
to trust to her own poor, raw, womanish
Judgment, as she did. Love
is blind, and will see nothing amiss,
where others may see an hundred
faults. Therefore I say, she should
not have trusted to her own thoughts
in the matter of his Goodness.
As to his Person, there she was
fittest to judge, because she was to be
the person pleased, but as to his
Godliness, there the Word was the
fittest Judge, and they that could
best understand it, because God was
therein to be pleased. I wish *A caution to young Maidens. that
all young Maidens will take heed of
being beguiled with flattering words,
with feigning and lying speeches,
and take the best way to preserve
themselves from being bought
and sold by wicked men, as she
was; lest they repent with her,
when (as to this) repentance will
do them no good, but for their unadvisedness
goe sorrowing to their
graves.
Atten. Well, things are past with
this poor woman, and cannot be called
back, let others *Let Mr. Badmans wife be your Example. beware, by her
misfortunes, lest they also fall into her
distress.

Wise. That is the thing that I
say, let them take heed, lest for
their unadvisedness they smart, as
this poor woman has done. And
ah! methinks, that they that yet are
single persons, and that are tempted
to marry to such as Mr. Badman;
would, to inform, and warn themselves
in this matter, before they
intangle themselves, but goe to
some that already are in the
snare, and ask them how it is with
them, as to the suitable, or unsuitableness
of their marriage, and desire
their advice. Surely they would
ring such a peal in their ears about
the unequality, unsuitableness, disadvantages,
and disquietments, and
fins that attend such marriages, that
would make them beware as long as
they live. But the bird in the air,
knows not the notes of the bird in
the snare, untill she comes thither
her self: Besides, to make up such
marriages, Satan, and carnal Reason,
and Lust, or at least Inconsiderateness,
has the chiefest hand; and
where these things bear sway, designs,
though never so destructive,
will goe headlong on: and therefore

I fear, that but little warning
will be taken by young Girls, at Mr.
Badmans wives affliction.
Atten. But are there no disswasive
arguments to lay before such, to prevent
their future misery.
Wise. Yes: There is the Law of
God, that forbiddeth marriage with
unbelievers. These kind of marriages
also are condemned even by
irrational creatures. 1. It is forbidden
by the Law of God both in the
Old Testament and in the New.
1.  In the Old. Thou shalt not make
Marriages with them; Thy daughter
thou shalt not give unto his son, nor
his daughter shalt thou take unto thy
son, Deut. 7. 4, 5. 2. In the New
Testament it is forbidden.  Be not
unequally yoaked together with unbelievers;
Let them marry to whom
they will, only in the Lord.
Here now is a prohibition,Rules for those that are to marry. plainly
forbidding the Believer to marry
with the Uubeliever, therefore they
should not do it. Again, these unwarrantable
Marriages, are, as I
may so say, condemned by irrational
creatures, who will not couple
but with their own sort: Will the

Sheep couple with a Dog, the Partridge
with a Crow, or the Feasant
with an Owl? No, they will strictly
tye up themselves to those of their
own sort only: Yea, it sets all the
world a wondring, when they see
or hear the contrary. Man only is
most subject to wink at, and allow
of these unlawful mixtures of men
and women; Because man only is
a sinful Beast, a sinful Bird, therefore
he, above all, will take upon
him by rebellious actions to answer,
or rather to oppose and violate the
Law of his God and Creator; nor
shall these, or other Interogatories,
[What fellowship? what concord?
what agreement? what communion
can there be in such Marriages?]
be counted of weight, or thought
worth the answering by him.
But further.If you love your Souls take heed. The dangers that
such do commonly run themselves
into, should be to others a disswasive
argument to stop them from doing
the like: for besides the distresses of
Mr. Badmans wife, many that have
had very hopefull beginnings for
heaven, have by vertue of the mischiefs
that have attended these unlawfull

marriages, miserably and
fearfully miscarried. Soon after such
marriages, Conviction (the first step
toward heaven) hath ceased; Prayer
(the next step toward Heaven)
hath ceased; Hungrings and
thirstings after salvation (another
step towards the Kingdom of Heaven)
have ceased. In a word, such
marriages have estranged them from
the Word, from their godly and
faithful Friends, and have brought
them again into carnal company,
among carnal Friends, and also into
carnal Delights, where, and with
whom they have in conclusion both
sinfully abode, and miserably perished.
And this is one reason why God
hath forbidden this kind of unequal
marriages. For they, saith he, meaning
the ungodly, will turn away thy
son from following me,  that they may
serve other Gods, so will the anger
of the Lord be kindled against you, and
destroy you suddenly. Now mark,
there were some in Israel, that
would, notwithstanding this prohibition,
venture to marry to the Heathens
and Unbelievers: But what

followed? They served their Idols,
they sacrificed their Sons and their
Daughters unto Devils. Thus were
they defiled with their own works,
and went a whoring with their
own Inventions: Therefore was the
wrath of the Lord kindled against
his people,  insomuch that he abhorred
his own Inheritance.
Atten. But let's return again to
Mr. Badman; had he any Children
by his wife?
Wise. Yes, seven.
Atten. I doubt they were but badly
brought up.
Wise.Badmans Children that he had by this good woman. One of them loved its Mother
dearly, and would constantly
harken to her voice. Now that
Child she had the opportunity to instruct
in the Principles of Christian
Religion, and it became a very
gracious child. But that child Mr.
Badman could not abide, he would
seldom afford it a pleasant word,
but would scowl and frown upon it,
speak churlishly and doggedly to it,
and though as to Nature it was the
most feeble of the seven, yet it
oftenest felt the weight of its Fathers
fingers. Three of his Children

did directly follow his steps, and
began to be as vile as (in his youth)
he was himself. The other that remained
became a kind of mungrel
Professors, not so bad as their Father,
nor so good as their Mother,
but were betwixt them both. They
had their Mothers Notions, and their
Fathers Actions, and were much like
those that you read of in the Book
of Nehemiah;  These children spake
half in the speech of Ashdod, and
could not speak in the Jews language,
but according to the language of each
people.
Atten. What you say in this matter,
is observable, and if I take not
my mark amiss, it often happeneth
after this manner where such unlawful
Marriages are contracted.
Wise.How the ungodly Father and godly Mother doe strive for the Children that God doth give them. It sometimes doth so, and
the reason, with respect to their
Parents, is this: Where the one of
the Parents is godly, and the other
ungodly and vile, (though they can
agree in begetting of Children, yet)
they strive for their Children when
they are born. The godly Parent
strives for the child, and by Prayers,
Counsel and good Examples,

labours to make it holy in body and
soul, and so fit for the Kingdom of
Heaven; but the ungodly would
have it like himself, wicked and
base and sinful; and so they both
give instructions accordingly: instructions
did I say? yea, and Examples
too, according to their minds.
Thus the godly, as Hannah, is presenting
her Samuel unto the Lord:
but the ungodly, like them that
went before them, are for offering
their Children to Moloch, to an Idol,
to sin, to the Devil, and to Hell.
Thus one harkeneth to the Law of
their Mother, and is preserved from
destruction, but as for the other,
as their Fathers did, so do they.
Thus did Mr. Badman and his wife
part some of their Children betwixt
them; but as for the other three
that were as 'twere Mungrels, betwixt
both, they were like unto
those that you read of in Kings,
They feared the Lord,  but served
their own Idols. They had, as I said,
their Mothers Notions, and I will
adde, Profession too; but their Fathers
Lusts, and something of his
Life. Now their Father did not like

them, because they had their Mothers
tongue; and the Mother did
not like them because they had still
their Fathers heart and life; nor
were they indeed fit company for
good or bad. The Good would
not trust them because they were
bad, the Bad would not trust them
because they were good, viz. The
good would not trust them because
they were bad in their Lives, and
the bad would not trust them because
they were good in their
Words: So they were forced with
Esau to joyn in affinity with Ishmael;
to wit, to look out a people
that were Hypocrites like themselves,
and with them they matcht,
and lived and died.
Atten. Poor woman, she could not
but have much perplexity.
Wise. Yea, and poor Children,
that ever they were sent into the
world as the fruit of the loyns, and
under the government of such a
father as Mr. Badman.
Atten. You say right, for such
children, lye, almost under all manner
of disadvantages: but we must say
nothing, because this also is the soveraign
Will of God.

Wise. We may not by any
means object against God: yet we
may talk of the advantages; and disadvantages
that Children have by
having for their Parents such as are
either Godly, or the contrary.
Atten. You say right, we may so,
and pray now, since we are about it,
speak something in brief unto it, that
is, unto this; What advantage those
Children have above others, that have
for their Parents such as indeed are
Godly.
Wise.The advantages that Children have, whose Parents are both godly. So I will, only I must first
premise these two or three things.
1. They have not the advantage
of Election for their fathers sakes.
2. They are born, as others, the
children of wrath, though they come
of Godly Parents.
3. Grace comes not unto them
as an Inheritance, because they have
Godly Parents. These things premised
I shall now proceed.
1. The children of Godly Parents
are the children of many Prayers:
they are prayed for before, and
Prayed for after they are born, and
the Prayer of a godly Father and
godly Mother doth much.

2. They have the advantage of
what restraint is possible, from
what evils their Parents see them inclinable
to, and that is a second mercy.
3. They have the advantage of
Godly instruction, and of being told
which be, and which be not the right
ways of the Lord.
4. They have also those ways
commended unto them, and spoken
well of in their hearing, that are
good.
5. Such are also, what may be,
kept out of evil company, from evil
Books, and from being taught the
way of Swearing, Lying, and the
like, as Sabbath-breaking, and mocking
at good men, and good things,
and this is a very great mercy.
6. They have also the benefit of a
godly life set before them doctrinally
by their Parents, and that doctrine
backt with a godly and holy example:
and all these are very great advantages.
Now all these advantages,The disadvantages that the Children of ungodly Parents have. the
children of ungodly Parents want;
and so are more in danger of being
carried away with the error of the

wicked. For ungodly Parents neither
Pray for their Children, nor do,
nor can they heartily instruct them
they do not after a godly manner
restrain them from evil, nor do
they keep them from evil company.
They are not grieved at, nor yet do
they forewarn their children to beware
of such evil actions that are abomination
to God, and to all good
men. They let their children break
the Sabbath, swear, lye, be wicked
and vain. They commend not to
their children an holy life, nor set a
good example before their eyes.
No, they do in all things contrary:
Estranging of their children what
they can, from the love of God and
all good men, so soon as they are
born. Therefore it is a very great
Judgment of God upon children to 
be the Offspring of base and ungodly
men.
Atten. Well, but before we leave
Mr. Badmans wife and children, I
have a mind, if you please, to enquire
a little more after one thing, the
which I am sure you can satisfie me
in.
Wise. What is that?

Atten. You said a while ago, that
this Mr. Badman would not suffer
his wife to go out to hear such godly
Ministers as she liked, but said if she
did, she had as good never come home
any more. Did he often carry it thus
to her?
Wise. He did say so, he did often
say so. This I told you then, and
had also then told you more, but
that other things put me out.
Atten. Well said, pray therefore
now go on.
Wise. So I will. Upon a time,
she was on a Lords day for going to
hear a Sermon, and Mr. Badman
was unwilling she should: but she
at that time, as it seems, did put on
more courage than she was wont;
and therefore, after she had spent
upon him, a great many fair words
and entreaties,A contest betwixt Mr. Badman and his wife. if perhaps she might
have prevailed by them, but all to
no purpose at all: At last she said
she would go, and rendred this
reason for it; I have an Husband,
but also a God; my God has commanded
me, and that upon pain of
damnation, to be a continual Worshipper
of him, and that in the way

of his own Appointments: I have
an Husband, but also a Soul, and my
Soul ought to be more unto me, than
all the world besides. This soul of
mine I will look after, care for, and
(if I can) provide it an Heaven for
its habitation. You are commanded
to love me,  as you love your own
body, and so do I love you; but I tell
you true, I preferr my Soul before
all the world, and its Salvation I will
seek.
At this, first,With what weapons Badman did deal with his wife. he gave her an ugly
wish, and then fell into a fearfull
rage, and sware moreover that if she
did go, he would make both her, and
all her damnable Brotherhood (for
so he was pleased to call them) to
repent their coming thither.
Atten. But what should he mean
by that?
Wise. You may easily guess what
he meant: he meant, he would
turn Informer, and so either weary
out those that she loved, from meeting
together to Worship God; or
make them pay dearly for their so
doing; the which if he did, he knew
it would vex every vein of her tender
heart.

Atten. But do you think Mr. Badman
would have been so base?
Wise. Truly he had malice, and
enmity enough in his heart to do it,
onely he was a Tradesman; also he
knew that he must live by his neighbours,
and so he had that little wit
in his anger, that he refrained himself,
and did it not. But, as I said,
he had malice and envy enough inMr. Badmans heart discovered as to its enmity against the friends of his wife.
his heart to have made him to do it,
only he thought it would worst him
in his trade: yet these three things
he would be doing.
1. He would be putting of others
on to molest and abuse her friends.
2. He would be glad when he
heard that any mischief befell them.
3. And would laugh at her, when
he saw her troubled for them. And
now I have told you Mr. Badmans
way as to this.
Atten. But was he not afraid of
the Judgments of God, that did fly about
at that time?
Wise. He regarded not the Judgment
nor Mercy of God, for had he
at all done that, he could not have
done as he did. But what Judgments
do you mean?

Atten. Such Judgments, that if
Mr Badman himself had taken but sober
notice of, they might have made
him a hung down his ears.
Wise. Why, have you heard of
any such persons that the Judgments
of God have overtaken.
Atten. Yes, and so, I believe, have
you too, though you make so strange
about it.
Wise. I have so indeed, to my
astonishment and wonder.
Atten. Pray therefore, if you please,
tell me what it is, as to this, that you
know; and then, herhaps, I may also
say something to you of the same.
Wise. In our Town there was one
W. S. a man of a very wicked life; 
&rhand;and he, when there seemed to be
countenance given to it, would needs
turn Informer. Well, so he did,
and was as diligent in his business as
most of them could be; he would
watch a nights, climb Trees, and
range the Woods a days, if possible,
to find out the Meeters, for then they
were forced to meet in the Fields:
yea, he would curse them bitterly,
and swear most fearfully what he
would do to them when he found

them. Well, after he had gone on
like a Bedlam in his course a while,
and had done some mischiefs to the
people, he was stricken by the hand
of God, and that in this manner.
1. Although he had his tongue naturally
at will, now he was taken
with a faultering in his speech, and
could not for weeks together speak
otherwise, than just like a man that
was drunk.
2. Then he was taken with a
drauling, or slabbering at his mouth,
which slabber sometimes would hang
at his mouth well nigh half way
down to the ground.
3. Then he had such a weakness
in the back sinews of his Neck, that
oft times he could not look up before
him, unless he clapped his
hand hard upon his forehead, and
held up his head that way, by
strength of hand.
4. After this his speech went quite
away, and he could speak no more
than a Swine or a Bear. Therefore,
like one of them, he would gruntle
and make an ugly noyse, according
as he was offended, or pleased, or
would have any thing done, &c.

In this posture he continued for the
space of half a year, or thereabouts,
all the while otherwise well, and
could go about his business, save
once that he had a fall from the Bell
as it hangs in our Steeple, which
'twas a wonder it did not kill him:
But after that he also walked about,
till God had made him a sufficient
spectacle of his Judgment for his sin,
and then on a sudden he was stricken
and dyed miserably: and so there
was an end of him and his doings.
I will tell you of another. &rhand;About 
four miles from St. Neots, there was
a Gentleman had a man, and he
would needs be an Informer, and
a lusty young man he was. Well,
an Informer he was, and did much
distress some people, and had perfected
his Informations so effectually
against some, that there was nothing
further to do, but for the Constables
to make distress on the people,
that he might have the Money
or Goods; and as I heard, he hastened
them much to do it. Now
while he was in the heat of his work,
as he stood one day by the Fire-side,
he had (it should seem) a mind to a

Sop in the Pan, (for the Spit was
then at the fire,) so he went to make
him one; but behold, a Dog (some
say his own Dog) took distaste at
something, and bit his Master by
the Leg; the which bite, notwithstanding
all the means that was used
to cure him, turned (as was said)
to a Gangrene; however, that
wound was his death, and that a
dreadful one too: for my Relator
said, that he lay in such a condition
by this bite, (as the beginning)
till his flesh rotted from off him before
he went out of the world.
But what need I instance in particular
persons, when the Judgement
of God against this kind of people
was made manifest, I think I may
say, if not in all, yet in most of the
Counties in England where such
poor Creatures were. But I would,
if it had been the will of God, that
neither I nor any body else, could
tell you more of these Stories: True
stories, that are neither Eye, nor
Romance.
Atten. Well, I also heard of both
these my self, and of more too, as remarkable
in their kind as these, if

I had any list to tell them; but let
us leave those that are behind to
others, or to the coming of Christ,
who then will justifie or condemn them
as the merit of their work shall require;
or if they repented, and found
mercy, I shall be glad when I know
it, for I wish not a curse to the Soul
of mine Enemy.
Wise. There can be no pleasure
in the telling of such stories, though
to hear of them may do us a pleasure:
They may put us in mind that
there is a God that judgeth in the
earth, and that doth not alwayes
forget nor deferre to hear the Crye
of the destitute; They also carry
along with them both Caution and
Counsel to those that are the survivers
of such. Let us tremble at the
Judgements of God, and be afraid
of sinning against him, and it shall
be our protection. It shall go well
with them that fear God, that fear
before him.
Atten. Well Sir, as you have intimated,
so I think we have in this
place spoken enough about these kind
of men; if you please, let us return
again to Mr. Badman himself, if

you have any more to say of him.
Wise. More! we have yet scarce
throughly begun with Any thing
that we have said. All the particulars
are in themselves so full of badness,
that we have rather only looked
in them, than indeed said any
thing to them: but we will pass
them, and proceed. You have heard
of the sins of his Youth, of his Apprentiship,
and how he set up, and
married, and what a life he hath
led his wife; and now I will tell
you some more of his pranks.New discourse of Mr. Badman. He
had the very knack of Knavery;
had he, as I said before, been bound
to serve an Apprentiship to all these
things, he could not have been
more cunning, he could not have
been more artificial at it.
Atten. Nor perhaps so artificially
neither. For as none can teach Goodness
like to God himself, so concerning
Sin and Knavery, none can teach
a man it like the Devil, to whom, as
I perceive, Mr. Badman went to
School from his Childhood to the end
of his life. But pray Sir, make a beginning.
Wise. Well so I will. You may

remember that I told you what a
condition he was in for Money before
he did marry, and how he got
a rich Wife, with whose Money he
paid his debts: Now when he had
paid his debts, he having some
Moneys left, he sets up again as
briskly as ever, keeps a great Shop,
drives a great Trade, and runs again
a great way into debt,Mr. Badman plays a new prank. but
now not into the debt of one or
two, but into the debt of many, so
that at last he came to owe some
thousands; and thus he went on a
good while. And to pursue his ends
the better, he began now to study
to please all men, and to suit himself
to any company; he could now
be as they, say as they, that is, if
he listed; and then he would list,
when he perceived that by so doing,
he might either make them his
Customers or Creditors for his Commodities.
If he dealt with honest
men, (as with some honest men he
did) then he would be as they;
talk as they, seem to be sober as
they, talk of Justice and Religion
as they, and against Debauchery as
they; yea, and would too seem to

shew a dislike of them that said,
did, or were otherwise than honest.
Again, when he did light among
those that were bad, then he would
be as they, but yet more close and
cautiously, except he were sure of
his company: Then he would carry
it openly, be as they; say, Damn 'em
and Sink 'em, as they. If they railed
on Good men, so could he; if
they railed on Religion, so could
he: if they talked beastly, vainly,
idlely,Mr. Badmans perfection. so would he; if they were
for drinking, swearing, whoring,
or any the like Villanies, so was he.
This was now the path he trod in,
and could do all artificially, as any
man alive. And now he thought
himself a perfect man, he thought
he was always a Boy till now.
What think you now of Mr. Badman?
Atten. Think! why, I think he
was an Atheist: For no man but an
Atheist can do this. I say, it cannot
be, but that the man that is such as
this Mr. Badman, must be a rank and
stinking Atheist; for he that believes
that there is either God or Devil,
Heaven or Hell, or Death, and Judgment

after, cannot doe as Mr. Badman
did; I mean, if he could do these
things without reluctancy and check
of Conscience; yea, if he had not sorrow
and remorse for such abominable
sins as these.
Wise. Nay, he was so far off from
reluctancies and remorse of Conscience
for these things, that he counted
them the excellency of his Attainments,
the quintessence of his Wit,
his rare and singular vertues, such
as but few besides himself could be
the Masters of. Therefore, as for
those that made boggle and stop
at things, and that could not in Conscience,
and for fear of Death and
Judgement, do such things as he;
he would call them Fools and Noddies,
and charge them for being
frighted with the talk of unseen Bugbears;
and would encourage them,
if they would be men indeed, to labour
after the attainment of this his
excellent art. He would often-times
please himself with the thoughts of
what he could do in this matter,
saying within himself; I can be religious,How Mr. Badman came to enjoy himself.
and irreligious, I can be any
thing, or nothing; I can swear,

and speak against swearing; I can
lye, and speak against lying; I can
drink, wench, be unclean, and defraud,
and not be troubled for it:
Now I enjoy my self, and am Master
of mine own wayes, and not
they of me. This I have attained
with much study, great care, and
more pains. But this his talk
should be only with himself, to his
wife, who he knew durst not divulge
it; or among his Intimates, to whom
he knew he might say any thing.
Atten. Did I call him before an
Atheist? I may call him now a Devil,
or a man possessed with one, if not
with many. I think that there cannot
be found in every corner such an
one as this. True, it is said of King
Ahaz,  that he sinned more and more;
and of Ahab,  that he sold himself to
work wickedness; and of the men of
Sodom,  that they were sinners exceedingly
before the Lord.
Wise. An Atheist he was no doubt,
if there be such a thing as an Atheist
in the world, but for all his brags of
perfection and security in his wickedness,
I believe that at times God
did let down fire from Heaven into 

his Conscience. True, I believe he
would quickly put it out again, and
grow more desperate and wicked afterward,
but this also turned to his
destruction, as afterward you may
hear.
But I am not of your mind, to
think that there are but few such in
the world; except you mean as to
the Degree of wickedness unto
which he had attained. For otherwise,
no doubt, *There are abundance like Mr. Badman. there is abundance
of such as he: men of the same mind,
of the same principles, and of the
same conscience too, to put them
into practice. Yea, I believe that
there are many that are endeavouring
to attain to the same pitch of
wickedness; and all them are such
as he, in the Judgment of the Law;
nor will their want of hellish wit
to attain thereto, excuse them at
the day of Judgment. You know
that in all Science, some are more
arch than some; and so it is in the
art, as well as in the practice of wickedness:
some are two fold, and some
seven-fold more the children of Hell
than others, (and yet all the children
of Hell,) else they would all be Masters,

and none scholars in the school
of wickedness. But there must be
Masters, and there must be Learners;
Mr. Badman was a master in this art,
and therefore it follows that he must
be an arch and chief one in that mystery.
Atten. You are in the right, for I
perceive that some men, though they
desire it, cannot be so arch in the
practice thereof as others, but are (as I
suppose they call them) fools and dunces
to the rest, their heads and capacities
will not serve them to act and
do so wickedly. But Mr. Badman
wanted not a wicked head to contrive,
as well as a wicked heart to do his
wickedne&esset;.
Wise. True, but yet I say, such
men shall at the day of Judgment,
be judged, not only for what they
are, but also for what they would
be.  For if the thought of foolishness
is sin, doubtless the desire of foolishness
is more sin: and if the desire
be more, the endeavour after it must
needs be more and more. *He that would be bad is bad. He
then that is not an artificial Atheist
and Transgressor, yet if he desires
to be so, if he endeavoureth to be so,

he shall be Judged and condemned
to Hell for such an one. For the
Law Judgeth men, as I said, according
to what they would be.  He
that looketh upon a woman to lust after
her, hath committed adultery with her
already in his heart. By the same
rule, he that would steal, doth steal;
he that would cheat, doth cheat;
he that would swear, doth swear;
and he that would commit adultery,
doth do so. For God Judgeth men
according to the working of their
minds, and saith; As he thinketh,
so is he.  That is, so is he in his
heart, in his intentions, in his desires, 
in his endeavours;  and Gods
Law, I say, lays hold of the desires,
intentions and endeavours, even as
it lays hold of the act of wickedness
it self. A man then that desires to
be as bad as Mr. Badman, (and
desires to be so wicked have many
in their hearts) though he never attains
to that proficiency in wickedness
as he, shall yet be Judged for
as bad a man as he, because 'twas
in his desires to be such a wicked
one.
Atten. But this height of wickedness

in Mr. Badman, will not yet
out of my mind. This hard, desperate,
or what shall I call it, diababolicall
frame of heart, was in him a
foundation, a groundwork to all acts
and deeds that were evil.
Wise. The heart, and the desperate
wickedness of it, is the foundation
and ground-work of all. Atheism,
professed and practicall,A bad heart makes a bad man. spring both
out of the heart, yea and all manner
of evils besides. For they be not
bad deeds that make a bad man, but
he is already a bad man that doth
bad deeds. A man must be wicked
before he can do wickedness. *  Wickedness
proceedeth from the wicked.
'Tis an evil tree that bears evil fruit,
men gather no grapes of thorns;  the
heart therefore must be evil, before
the man can do evil, and good before
the man doth good.
Atten. Now I see the reason why
Mr. Badman was so base, as to get a
Wife by dissimulation, and to abuse
her so like a Villain when he had got
her, it was because he was before by
a wicked heart prepared to act wickedness.
Wise. You may be sure of it; for

from within, out of the heart of
man proceedeth evil thoughts, Adulteries,
Fornications, Murders, Thefts, 
Coveteousness, Wickedness, Deceit,
Lasciviousness, an evil Eye, Blasphemy,
Pride, Foolishness. All these
things come from within, and defile a
man. And a man, as his naughty
mind inclines him, makes use of
these, or any of these, to gratifie
his lust, to promote his designs, to
revenge his malice, to enrich, or to
wallow himself in the foolish pleasures
and pastimes of this life: And
all these did Mr. Badman do, even
to the utmost, if either opportunity,
or purse, or perfidiousness, would
help him to the obtaining of his purpose.
Atten. Purse! Why he could not
but have Purse to do almost what he
would, having married a wife with so
much money.
Wise. Hold you there; some of
Mr. Badmans sins were costly, as
his drinking, and whoring, and keeping
other bad company; though he
was a man that had ways too many
to get money, as well as ways too
many to spend it.

Atten. Had he then such a good
Trade, for all he was such a bad
man? or was his Calling so gainfull
to him, as alwayes to keep his Purses
belly full, though he was himself a
great spender?
Wise. No: It was not his Trade
that did it, though he had a pretty
trade too. He had another way to
get Money, and that by hatfulls
and pocketfulls at a time.
Atten. Why I trow he was no Highway
man, was he?
Wise. I will be sparing in my
speech as to that, though some have
muttered as if he could ride out
now and then, about no body but
himself knew what, over night, and
come home all dirty and weary next
morning. But that is not the thing
I aim at.
Atten. Pray let me know it, if you
think it convenient that I should.
Wise. I will tell you: It was this,
he had an art to Break, and get hatfulls
of money by breaking.
Atten.Mr. Badman had an art to break, and so get money that way. But what do you mean by
Mr. Badmans Breaking? you speak
mystically, do you not?
Wise. No, no, I speak plainly.

Or, if you will have it in plainer language,
'tis this: When Mr. Badman
had swaggered and whored away
most of his wifes portion, he began
to feel that he could not much longer
stand upon his legs in this course of
life, and keep up his Trade and Repute
(such as he had) in the world;
but by the new Engine of Breaking.
Wherefore, upon a time, he
gives a great, and sudden †How he managed things in order to his breaking. rush
into several mens debts, to the value
of about four or five thousand
pound, driving at the same time
a very great trade, by selling many
things for less than they cost him,
to get him custom, therewith to blind
his Creditors eyes. His Creditors
therefore seeing that he had a great
employ, and dreaming that it must
needs at length turn to a very good
account to them, trusted him freely
without mistrust, and so did others
too, to the value of what was mentioned
before. Well, when Mr. Badman
had well feathered his Nest with
other mens goods and money, after
a little time †He breaks. he breaks. And by
and by it is noysed abroad that Mr.
Badman had shut up Shop, was gone,

and could trade no longer. Now,
by that time his breaking was come
to his Creditors ears, he had by Craft
and Knavery made so sure of what
he had, that his Creditors could not
touch a penny. Well, when he
had done, he sends his mournfull sugered
letters to his Creditors, to let
them understand what had happened
unto him, and desired them not to
be severe with him; *Mr. Badmans suger words to his Creditors. for he bore
towards all men an honest mind, and
would pay so far as he was able.
Now he sends his letters by a man
*Badmans friend. confederate with him, who could
make both the worst, and best of
Mr. Badmans case: The best for Mr.
Badman, and the worst for his Creditors.
So when he comes to them,
he both bemoans them, and condoles
Mr. Badmans condition: Telling
of them, that without a speedy bringing
of things to a conclusion, Mr.
Badman would be able to make
them no satisfaction, but at present
he both could, and would, and that
to the utmost of his power: and to
that end, he desired that they would
come over to him. Well, his Creditors
appoint him a time, and come

over; and he, mean while, authorizes
another to treat with them,
but will not be seen himself, unless
it was on a Sunday, lest they should
snap him with a Writ. So his deputed
friend treats with them about
their concern with Mr. Badman, first
telling them of the great care that
Mr. Badman took to satisfie them
and all men for whatsoever he ought,
as far as in him lay, and, how little
he thought a while since to be in
this low condition. He pleaded also
the greatness of his Charge, the
greatness of Taxes, the Badness
of the times, and the great Losses
that he had by many of his customers,
some of which died in his
debt, others were run away, and
for many that were alive, he never
expected a farthiug from them. Yet
nevertheless he would shew himself
an honest man, and would pay
as far as he was able; and if they
were willing to come to terms, he
would make a composition with
them,What Mr. Badman propounds to his Creditors. (for he was not able to pay
them all.) The creditors asked what
he would give? 'Twas replyed, Half
a crown in the pound. At this they

began to huff, and he to renew his
complaint and entreaty; but the Creditors
would not hear, and so for that
time their meeting without success
broke up. But after his Creditors
were in cool blood, and admitting of
second thoughts, and fearing lest
delays should make them lose all,
they admit of a second debate, come
together again, and by many words,
and great ado,They at last agree, and Mr. Badman gains by breaking. they obtained five
shillings i'th' pound. So the money
was produced, Releases and Discharges
drawn, signed, and sealed,
Books crossed, and all things confirmed;
and then Mr. Badman can
put his head out a dores again, and
be a better man than when he shut
up Shop, by several thousands of
pounds.
Atten. And did he do thus indeed?
Wise. Yes, once, and again. I
think he brake twice or thrice.
Atten. And did he do it before he
had need to do it?
Wise. Need! What do you mean
by need? there is no need at any
time for a man to play the knave.
He did it of a wicked mind, to defraud

and beguile his Creditors:There is no plea for his dishonesty. he
had wherewithall of his Father, and
also by his Wife, to have lived upon,
with lawfull labour, like an honest
man. He had also when he made
this wicked Break (though he had
been a profuse and prodigal spender)
to have paid his creditors their
own to a farthing. But had he done
so, he had not done like himself,
like Mr. Badman; had he, I say, dealt
like an honest man, he had then gone
out of Mr. Badmans road. He did
it therefore of a dishonest mind, and
to a wicked end; to wit, that he
might have wherewithall, howsoever
unlawfully gotten, to follow his Cups
and Queans, and to live in the full
swinge of his lusts, even as he did before.
Atten. Why this was a meer
Cheat.
Wise. It was a cheat indeed. This
way of breaking, it is nothing else
but a more neat way of Thieving,
of picking of pockets, of breaking
open of shops, and of taking from
men what one has nothing to do
with. But though it seem easie, it
is hard to learn, no man that has

conscience to God or man, can
ever be his Crafts Master in this Hellish
art.
Atten. Oh! Sirs! what a wicked
man was this!
Wise. A wicked man indeed. By
this art he could tell how to make
men send their goods to his shop,
and then be glad to take a penny for
that for which he had promised before
it came thither, to give them
a Groat: I say, he could make them
glad to take a Crown for a pounds
worth, and a thousand for that for
which he had promised before to
give them four thousand pounds.
Atten. This argueth that Mr.
Badman had but little conscience.
Wise. This argued that Mr. Badman
had No Conscience at all; for
Conscience, the least spark of a good
Conscience cannot endure this.
Atten. Before we go any further
in Mr. Badmans matters, let me desire
you, if you please, to give me an
answer to these two questions.
1.An answer to two questions. What do you find in the Word
of God against such a practice, as this
of Mr. Badmans is?
2. What would you have a man

do that is in his Creditors debt, and
can neither pay him what he owes him,
nor go on in a trade any longer?
Wise. I will answer you as well
as I can. And first to the first of your
questions: To wit,1. Question. What I find
in the Word of God against such a
practice, as this of Mr. Badmans
is.
Answ. The Word of God doth
forbid this wickedness; and to make
it the more odious in our eyes, it
joyns it with Theft and Robbery:
Thou shalt not, says God,  defraud thy
neighbour, nor rob him. Thou shalt
not defraud, that is, deceive or beguile.
Now thus to break is to
defraud, deceive and beguile; which
is, as you see, forbidden by the God
of Heaven: Thou shalt not defraud thy
neighbour, nor rob him. It is a kind
of theft and robbery, thus to defraud,
and beguile. It is a wilely robbing
of his shop,The hainousness of this sin. and picking of his pocket:
a thing odious to Reason and
Conscience, and contrary to the
Law of nature. It is a designed piece
of wickedness, and therefore a
double sin. A man cannot do this
great wickedness on a sudden, and

through a violent assault of Satan.
He that will commit this sin, must
have time to deliberate, that by invention
he may make it formidable,
and that with lies and high dissimulations.
He that commits this
wickedness, must first hatch it
upon his bed, beat his head about it,
and lay his plot strong: So that to
the compleating of such a wickedness,
there must be adjoyned many
sins, and they too, must go hand
in hand untill it be compleated. But
what saith the Scripture?  *fair warning. Let no
man go beyond, and defraud his Brother
in any matter, because the Lord
is the avenger of all such. But this
kind of Breaking is a going beyond
my Brother; This is a compassing
of him about that I may catch him
in my net; and as I said, an art to
rob my Brother, and to pick his
pocket, and that with his consent.
Which doth not therefore mitigate,
but so much the more greaten and
make odious the offence. For men
that are thus wilily abused cannot
help themselves, they are taken in
a deceitfull net. But God will here
concern himself, he will be the avenger,

he will be the avenger of all such
either here or in another world.
And this, the Apostle testifies again,
where he saith;  But he that
doth wrong,† Fair warning again. shall recieve for the wrong
that he hath done, and there is no respect
of persons. That is, there is no
man, be he what he will, if he will
be guilty of this sin, of going beyond,
of beguiling of, and doing wrong to
his Brother, but God will call him
to an account for it, and will pay
him with vengeance for it too; for
there is no respect of persons.
I might add, that this sin of wronging,
of going beyond, and defrauding
of my Neighbour, it is like
that first prank that the Devil plaid
with our first Parents, (as the Altar
that Vriah built for Ahaz, was taken
from the fashion of that that stood at
Damascus,He that designedly commits this sin is like the Devil. to be the very pattern
of it.) The Serpent beguiled me, says
Eve; Mr. Badman beguiles his Creditors.
The Serpent beguiled Eve
with lying promises of gain; and so
did Mr. Badman beguile his Creditors.
The Serpent said one thing
and meant another, when he beguiled
Eve; and so did Mr. Badman

when he beguiled his Creditors.
