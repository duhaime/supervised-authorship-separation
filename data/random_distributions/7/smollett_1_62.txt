He recompenses the attachment of his friend:
aud receives a letter that reduces him to the
verge of death and distraction. 
This step being taken, his mind in some
measure retrieved its former tranquillity:
he soothed himself with the prospect of
an happy reconciliation with the divine Monimia,
and his fancy was decoyed from every
disagreeable presage by the entertaining conversation
of his sister, with whom in two days
he set out for Presburg, attended by his friend
the major, who had never quitted him since
their meeting at Brussels. Here they found
Count Trebasi entirely rid of the fever which
had been occasioned by his wound, and in a
fair way of doing well; a circumstance that
afforded unspeakable pleasure to Melvile, whose
manner of thinking was such, as would have 

made him unhappy, could he have charged
himself with the death of his mother's husband,
howsoever criminal he might have been. 
The count's ferocity did not return with
his health: his eyes were opened by the danger
he had incurred, and his sentiments turned
in a new channel: he heartily asked pardon of
mademoiselle for the rigorous useage she had
suffered from the violence of his temper; 
thanked Renaldo for the seasonable lesson he
had administered to him; and not only insisted
upon being removed from the castle to an
house of his own in Presburg, but proffered
to make immediate restitution of all the rents
which he unjustly converted to his own use. 
These things being settled in the most amicable
manner, to the entire satisfaction of the
parties concerned, as well as of the neighbouring
noblesse, among whom the house of Melvile
was in universal esteem, Renaldo resolved
to sollicit leave at the Imperial court to return
to England, in order to investigate the affair
of Monimia, which was more interesting than
all the points he had hitherto adjusted: but
before he quitted Presburg, his friend Farrel
taking him aside one day, “Count,” said he,
“will you give me leave to ask, if, by my
zeal and attachment for you, I have had the
good fortune to acquire your esteem?” “To
doubt that esteem,” replied Renaldo, “were
to suspect my gratitude and honour, of which
I must be utterly destitute before I lose the
sense of those obligations I owe to your gallantry
and friendship: obligations which I
long for a proper occasion to repay.” 
“Well then,” resumed the major, “I will
deal with you like a downright Swiss, and 

point out a method by which you may shift
the load of obligation from your own shoulders
to mine. You know my birth, rank and
expectations in the service: but perhaps you
do not know, that, as my expence hath always
unavoidably exceeded my income, I find myself
a little out at elbows in my circumstances,
and want to piece them up by matrimony. 
Of those ladies with whom I think I have any
chance of succeeding, mademoiselle de Melvile
seems the best qualified to render my situation
happy in all respects. Her fortune is
more than sufficient to disembarrass my affairs:
her good sense will be a seasonable check upon
my vivacity; her agreeable accomplishments
will engage a continuation of affection and regard: 
I know my own disposition well enough
to think I shall become a most dutiful and
tractable husband; and shall deem myself
highly honoured in being more closely united
to my dear count de Melvile, the son and representative
of that worthy officer under whom
my youth was formed: if you will therefore
sanction my claim, I will forthwith begin my
approaches, and doubt not, under your auspices,
to bring the place to a capitulation.” 
Renaldo was pleased with the frankness of
this declaration, approved of his demand, and
desired him to depend upon his good offices
with his sister, whom he sounded, that same
evening, upon the subject, recommending the
major to her favour, as a gentleman well worthy
of her choice. Mademoiselle, who had
never been exercised in the coquetries of her
sex, and was now arrived at those years, when
the vanity of youth ought to yield to discretion,
considered the proposal as a philosopher, 

and after due deliberation, candidly owned
she had no objection to the match. Farrel was
accordingly introduced in the character of a
lover, after the permission of the countess had
been obtained; and he carried on his addresses
in the usual form, so much to the satisfaction
of all concerned in the event, that a day
was appointed for the celebration of his nuptials,
when he entered into peaceable possession
of his prize. 
A few days after this joyful occasion, while
Renaldo was at Vienna, where he had been
indulged with leave of absence for six months,
and employed in making preparations for his
journey to Britain, he was one evening presented,
by his servant, with a pacquet from
London, which he no sooner opened, than he
found inclosed a letter directed to him, in the
hand writing of Monimia. He was so much
affected at sight of those well-known characters,
that he stood motionless as a statue, eager
to know the contents, yet afraid to peruse the
billet. While he hesitated in this suspence, he
chanced to cast his eye on the inside of the cover,
and perceived the name of his Jewish
friend at the bottom of a few lines, importing,
that the inclosed was delivered to him by a
physician of his acquaintance, who had recommended
it in a particular manner to his
care. This intimation served only to encrease
the mystery, and whet his impatience; and as
he had the explanation in his hand, he summoned
all his resolution to his aid, and breaking
the seal, began to read these words, “Renaldo
will not suppose, that this address proceeds
from interested motives, when he learns, 

that, before it can be presented to his view,
the unfortunate Monimia will be no more.” 
Here the light forsook Renaldo's eyes, his
knees knocked together, and he fell at full
length insensible on the floor: his valet hearing
the noise, ran into the apartment, lifted
him upon a couch, and dispatched a messenger
for proper assistance, while he himself endeavoured
to recall his spirits by such applications
as chance afforded: but before the count exhibited
any signs of life, his brother-in-law
entered his chamber by accident, and as soon
as he recollected himself from the extreme confusion
and concern produced by this melancholy
spectacle, he perceived the fatal epistle
which Melvile, though insensible, still kept
within his grasp; justly suspecting this to be
the cause of that severe paroxysm, he drew
near the couch, and with difficulty read what
is above rehearsed, and the sequel, to this effect. 
“Yes, I have taken such measures as will
prevent it from falling into your hands, until
after I shall have been released from a being
imbittered with inexpressible misery and anguish. 
It is not my intention, once loved, and
ah! still too fondly remembered youth, to
upbraid you as the source of that unceasing
woe, which has been so long the sole inhabitant
of my lonely bosom. I will not call you
inconstant or unkind. I dare not think you
base or dishonourable; yet I was abruptly sacrificed
to a triumphant rival, before I had
learned to bear such mortification; before I
had overcome the prejudices which I had imbibed
in my father's house. I was all at once
abandoned to despair, to indigence and distress, 

to the vile practices of a villain, who, I fear,
hath betrayed us both. What have not I suffered
from the insults and vicious designs of
that wretch, whom you cherished in your bosom!
yet to these I owe this near approach to
that goal of peace, where the canker-worm
of sorrow will expire. Beware of that artful
traitor; and, oh! endeavour to overcome that
levity of disposition, which, if indulged, will
not only stain your reputation, but also debauch
the good qualities of your heart. I
release you, in the sight of heaven, from all
obligations: if I have been injured, let not
my wrongs be visited on the head of Renaldo,
for whom shall be offered up the last fervent
prayers of the hapless Monimia.” 
This letter was a clue to the labyrinth of
Melvile's distress: though the major had never
heard him mention the name of this beauty,
he had received such hints from his own
wife, as enabled him to comprehend the whole
of the count's disaster. By the administration
of stimulating medicines, Renaldo recovered
his perception: but this was a cruel alternative,
considering the situation of his thoughts. The
first word he pronounced was Monimia, with
all the emphasis of the most violent despair; 
he perused the letter, and poured forth incoherent
execrations against Fathom and himself. 
He exclaimed in a frantic tone, “she is
lost for ever! murthered by my unkindness!
we are both undone by the infernal arts of
Fathom! execrable monster! Restore her to
my arms. If thou are not a fiend in reality,
I will tear out thy false heart!” 
So saying, he sprung upon his valet, who
would have fallen a sacrifice to his undistinguishing 

fury, had not he been saved by the
interposition of Farrel and the family, who
disengaged him from his master's gripe by dint
of force; yet, notwithstanding their joint endeavours,
he broke from this restraint, leaped
upon the floor, and seizing his sword, attempted
to plunge it in his own breast. When he
was once more overcome by numbers, he cursed
himself, and all those who with-held him; 
swore he would not survive the fair victim who
had perished by his credulity and indiscretion; 
and the agitation of his spirits increased to
such a degree, that he was seized with strong
convulsions, which nature was scarce able to
sustain: every medical expedient was used to
quiet this perturbation, which at length yielded
so far as to subside into a continual fever,
and confirmed delirium, during which he ceased
not to pour forth the most pathetic complaints
touching his ruined love, and to rave
about the ill starred Monimia. The major,
half distracted by the calamity of his friend,
would have concealed it from the knowledge
of his family, had not the physician, by despairing
of his life, laid him under the necessity
of making them acquainted with his
condition. 
The countess and Mrs Farrel were no sooner
informed of his case, than they hasted to
the melancholy scene, where they found Renaldo
deprived of his senses, panting under
the rage of an exasperated disease. They saw
his face distorted, and his eyes glaring with
frenzy; they heard him invoke the name of
Monimia, with a tenderness of accent, which
even the impulse of madness could not destroy. 
Then with a sudden transition of tone and 

gesture, he denounced vengeance against her
betrayer, and called upon the north wind to
cool the fervour of his brain. His hair hung
in dishevelled parcels, his cheeks were wan,
his looks ghastly, his vigour was fled, and all
the glory of his youth faded; the physician
hung his head in silence, the attendants wrung
their hands in despair, and the countenance
of his friend was bathed in tears. 
Such a picture would have moved the most
obdurate heart; what impression then must it
have made upon a parent and sister, melting
with all the enthusiasm of affection! The mother
was struck dumb, and stupified with
grief; the sister threw herself on the bed in a
transport of sorrow, caught her loved Renaldo
in her arms, and was, with great difficulty,
tore from his embrace. Such was the dismal
reverse that overtook the late so happy family
of Melvile; such was the extremity to which
the treachery of Fathom had reduced his best
benefactor! 
Three days did nature struggle with surprising
efforts, and then the constitution seemed
to sink under the victorious fever; yet, as his
strength diminished, his delirium abated, and
on the fifth morning he looked round, and
recognized his weeping friends. Though now
exhausted to the lowest ebb of life, he retained
the perfect use of speech, and his reason
being quite unclouded, spoke to each with equal
kindness and composure; he congratulated
himself upon the sight of shore, after the
horrors of such a tempest; called upon the
countess and his sister, who were not permitted
to see him at such a conjuncture, and being
apprized by the major, of his reason for excluding 

them from his presence, he applauded
his concern, bequeathed them to his future
care, and took leave of that gentleman with a
cordial embrace. Then he desired to be left
in private with a certain clergyman, who regulated
the concerns of his soul; and he being
dismissed, turned his face from the light, in
expectation of his final discharge: in a few
minutes all was still and dreary; he was no
longer heard to breathe, no more the stream
of life was perceived to circulate; he was supposed
to be absolved from all his cares, and an
universal groan from the by-standers anounced
the decease of the gallant, generous, and
tender hearted Renaldo. 
“Come hither ye, whom the pride of youth
and health, of birth and affluence, inflames; who
tread the flowery maze of pleasure, trusting to the
fruition of ever-circling joys; ye who glory
in your accomplishments, who indulge the
views of ambition, and lay schemes for future
happiness and grandeur; contemplate here the
vanity of life: behold how low this excellent
young man is laid! mowed down even in the
blossom of his youth, when fortune seemed to
open all her treasures to his worth!” 
Such were the reflections of the generous
Farrel, who, while he performed the last office
of friendship, inclosing the eyes of the
much-lamented Melvile, perceived a warmth
on the skin, which the hand of death seldom
leaves unextinguished: this uncommon sensation
he reported to the physician, who, tho'
he could feel no pulsation in the heart or arteries,
conjectured, that life still lingered in
some of its interior haunts, and immediately
ordered such applications to the extremities and 

surface of the body, as might help to concentrate
and reinforce the natural heat. 
By these prescriptions, which, for some time,
produced no sensible effect, the embers were,
in all probability, kept glowing, and the vital
power revived; for, after a considerable pause,
respiration was gradually renewed at long intervals,
a languid motion was perceived at the
heart, a few feeble and irregular pulsations were
felt at the wrist; the clay-coloured livery of
death began to vanish from his face; the circulation
acquired new force, and he opened
his eyes with a sigh, which proclaimed his return
from the shades of death. 
When he recovered the faculty of swallowing,
a cordial was administered; and whether
the fever abated, in consequence of the blood's
being cooled and condensed during the recess
of action in the solids, or nature, in that agony,
had prepared a proper channel for the expulsion
of the disease; certain it is, he was, from
this moment, rid of all bodily pain, he retrieved
the animal functions, and nothing remained
of his malady but an extreme weakness
and languor, the effect of nature's being fatigued
in the battle she had won. 
Unutterable was the joy that took possession
of his mother and sister, when Farrel flew into
their apartment, to intimate this happy turn. 
Scarce could they be restrained from pouring
forth their transports in the presence of Renaldo,
who was still too feeble to endure such
communication; indeed he was extremely
mortified and dejected at this event, which
had diffused such pleasure and satisfaction
among his friends; for tho' his distemper was
mastered, the fatal cause of it still rankled at his 

heart, and he considered this respite from death
as a protraction of his misery. 
When he was congratulated by the major,
on the triumph of his constitution, he replied,
with a groan, “I would to heaven it had been
otherwise; for I am reserved for all the horrors
of the most poignant sorrow and remorse. 
O Monimia! Monimia! I hoped, by this time,
to have convinced thy gentle shade, that I was,
at least intentionally, innocent of that ruthless
barbarity which hath brought thee to an untimely
grave. Heaven and earth! do I still
survive the consciousness of that dire catastrophe!
and lives the attrocious villain who hath
blasted all our hopes!” 
With these last words, the fire darted from
his eyes, and his brother, snatching this occasional
handle for reconciling him to life, joined
in his exclamations against the treacherous Fathom,
and observed, that he should not, in
point of honour, wish to die, until he should
have sacrificed that traitor to the manes of the
beauteous Monimia. This incitement acted as
a spur upon exhausted nature, causing the blood
to circulate with fresh vigour, and encouraging
him to take such sustenance as would recruit
his strength, and repair the damage which his
health had sustained. 
His sister assiduously attended him in his recovery,
flattering his appetite, and amusing his
sorrow at the same time; the clergyman assailed
his despondence with religious weapons, as
well as with arguments drawn from philosophy; 
and the fury of his passions being already
expended, he became so tractable as to listen to
his remonstrances: but notwithstanding the
joint endeavours of all his friends, a deep-fixed 

melancholy remained, after every consequence
of his disease had vanished: in vain they assayed
to elude his grief by gaiety and diversions; 
in vain they tried to decoy his heart into some
new engagement. 
These kind attempts served only to feed and
nourish that melancholy which pined within
his bosom. Monimia still haunted him in the
midst of these amusements, while his reflection
whispered to him, “Pleasures like these I might
have relished with her participation.” That
darling idea mingled in all the female assemblies
at which he was present, eclipsing their attractions,
and inhancing the bitterness of his loss; 
for absence, enthusiasm, and even his despair
had heightened the charms of the fair orphan
into something supernatural and divine. 
Time, that commonly weakens the traces of
remembrance, seemed to deepen its impressions
in his breast: nightly, in his dreams, did he
converse with his dear Monimia: sometimes
on the verdant bank of a delightful stream,
where he breathed, in soft murmurs, the dictates
of his love and admiration: sometimes reclined
within the tufted grove, his arm encircled
and sustained her snowy neck, whilst she,
with looks of love ineffable, gazed on his face,
invoking heaven to bless her husband and her
lord: yet, even in these illusions, was his fancy
oft alarmed for the ill-fated fair: sometimes he
viewed her tottering on the brink of a steep
precipice, far distant from his helping hand:
at other times she seemed to sail along the boisterous
tide, imploring his assistance: then
would he start with horror from his sleep, and
feel his sorrows more than realized: he deserted
his couch: he avoided the society of mankind: 

he courted sequestered shades, where he
could indulge his melancholy; there his mind
brooded over his calamity, until his imagination
became familiar with all the ravages of
death: it contemplated the gradual decline of
Monimia's health; her tears, her distress, her
despair at his imagined cruelty; he saw thro'
that perspective, every blossom of her beauty
wither, every sparkle vanish from her eyes: he
beheld her faded lips, her pale cheek, and her
inanimated features, the symmetry of which
not death itself was able to destroy. His fancy
conveyed her breathless corse to the cold
grave, o'er which, perhaps, no tear humane was
shed, where her delicate limbs were consigned
to dust, where she was dished out a delicious
banquet to the unsparing worm. 
O'er these pictures he dwelt with a sort of
pleasing anguish, until he became so enamoured
of her tomb, that he could no longer resist
the desire which compelled him to make a pilgrimage
to the dear hallowed spot, where all
his once gay hopes lay buried; that he might
nightly visit the silent habitation of his ruined
love, embrace the sacred earth with which she
was now compounded, moisten it with his
tears, and bid the turf lie easy on her breast. 
Besides the prospect of this gloomy enjoyment,
he was urged to return to England, by an eager
desire of taking vengeance on the perfidious
Fathom, as well as of acquitting himself of the
obligations he owed in that kingdom, to those
who had assisted him in his distress. He therefore
communicated his intention to Farrel, who
would have insisted upon attending him in the
journey, had not he been conjured to stay and
manage Renaldo's affairs in his absence. Every 

previous step being taken, he took leave of
the countess and his sister, who had, with all
their interest and elocution, opposed his design,
the execution of which, they justly feared,
would, instead of dissipating, augment his
chagrin; and now, seeing him determined,
they shed a flood of tears at his departure, and
he set out from Vienna in a post chaise, accompanied
by a trusty valet de chambre on horseback.
