The two young gentlemen display their talents for
gallantry, in the course of which they are involved
in a ludicrous circumstance of distress, and
afterwards take vengeance on the author of their
mishap. 
Mean while our hero and his new friend,
together with honest Jack Hatchway,
made daily excursions into the country, visited
the gentlemen in the neighborhood, and frequently
accompanied them to the chace; all three
being exceedingly caressed on account of their
talents, which could accommodate themselves
with great facility to the tempers and turns of
their entertainers. The lieutenant was a droll in
his way, Peregrine possessed a great fund of
sprightliness and good humour, and Godfrey, among
his other qualifications already recited,
sung a most excellent song; so that the company
of this triumvirate was courted in all parties, whether
male or female; and if the hearts of our
young gentlemen had not been pre-engaged, they
would have met with opportunities in abundance
of displaying their address in the art of love; not
but that they gave a loose to their gallantry without
much interesting their affections, and amused
themselves with little intrigues, which, in the
opinion of a man of pleasure, do not affect his
fidelity to the acknowledged sovereign of his soul. 
Had they used those advantages which their
skill and accomplishments gave them over the
warm unpractised minds of the young ladies to
whom they had access, almost every family in the 

county, might have had cause to rue their acquaintance; 
but our adventurers, wild and licentious
as they were, governed their actions by certain
notions of honour, which they never presumed
to infringe, and therefore, no domestic
tragedies took rise from their behaviour. 
Among the lower class of people, they did not
act with the same virtuous moderation, but laid
close siege to every buxom country damsel that
fell in their way; imagining that their dalliance
with such Dulcineas could produce no fatal effects; 
and that it would be in their power to attone
for any damage these inamorata's might
sustain. 
In the prosecution of these amours, Gauntlet
could not help discovering a particular biass towards
married women, and when questioned by
his friend, defended his singularity of taste, by
observing that such connections, if discreetly managed,
are attended by none of those bad consequences
which commonly pursue an amorous correspondence
with single persons; because the
wedded dame's fortune is already made, and her
husband stands as a buttress before her reputation. 
Though Peregrine could not approve of this
maxim which the soldier had adopted in the course
of a military education, he could not avoid engaging
as a second and confidant to his friend, in
an intrigue which he carried on with a farmer's
wife in the neighbourhood. Godfrey had practised
all his arts in attempting to overcome the
chastity of this woman, who was an hale rosy
wench, lately married; and at length succeeded
so far in his addresses, that she promised to admit
him one night when her husband would be absent 

on business, which called him once a fortnight
to the next market town. 
He communicated his good fortune to Perry,
desiring that he would accompany him to the
place, in case of accident; and our young gentleman
having undertaken the office of standing
centinel over his friend, while he should enjoy
his conquest, they set out at the time appointed,
and arriving at the door, the gallant made the
signal which had been agreed upon, and was let
in accordingly, after having assured his confidant
that he would be with him again in two hours at
farthest. 
Thus left to his own meditations, our hero began
his patrole, beguiling the time with the most
amusing fancies of a glowing imagination, and
enjoying by anticipation all the pleasures attending
affluence and youth, till at length his reverie
was interrupted by a plump shower that compelled
him to seek for shelter in a sort of shed, the door
of which stood open to his view. Thither therefore
he betook himself, and groping about as he
entered in the dark, chanced to lay hold on a
bushy beard, to his infinite surprize and consternation. 
Before he had time to form any conjecture
concerning this strange object of his touch, he
received a sudden shock upon his forehead that
felled him to the ground in an instant, and as he
lay, underwent the trampling of a huge body that
rushed over him into the field. In this attitude he
remained extended for the space of several minutes,
before he recovered the use of sensation
which he had lost, and then he perceived the
blood trickling down from his temples in a double
stream. The cause of this misfortune was still a
mystery to him, and he made shift to rise, cursing 

his fate for having sustained such visible marks
of disgrace in the exercise of such a ridiculous office; 
when strolling about with his handkerchief
applied to his hurts, he discerned on the farther
side of a tree a pair of large eyes glancing like
two coals of fire. He immediately unsheathed his
hanger, in the belief that now he had found the
author of his mischance; and springing forward
on his adversary, aimed a furious stroke that entered
the body of the tree, in which his weapon
stuck so fast, that he could not disengage it without
some difficulty; while the object of his wrath
made a precipitate retreat, and by an exclamation,
gave him to know that his assailant was no
other than an he-goat. 
Mad as he was with indignation and shame, he
could not help laughing at the ludicrous adventure,
and had just set his invention at work to
find some plausible excuse which he might make
to the world, for the patches he knew he must
wear on his face, when a window of the first
story flying open, he saw something white descend
with astonishing velocity, and running to
the spot, found his friend Godfrey naked to the
shirt. Confounded at his condition, he began to
inquire into the reason of his precipitation, but
received no answer until he had followed the fugitive
to a place where they could not be overheard. 
There he understood that the soldier had
been decoyed into the snare by the connivance of
the husband, by whose direction he had (without
all doubt) been admitted not only into the house,
but even into his wife's own bed, where the jilt
had left him undressed, on pretence of fastening
the doors, but in reality with a view of giving the
hint to the farmer, who armed with a pitchfork 

and supported by his man, entered the room before
he was aware, secured his sword and cloaths,
and obliged him to take refuge in a closet, from
the window of which he had thrown himself, in
order to avoid the resentment of the boor, and
the disgrace as well as expence of being taken in
that situation. 
Peregrine was tempted to laugh at the ridiculous
issue of this adventure, but restrained himself
in consideration of his friend's temper and
condition, neither of which were at that time
proper objects of mirth; and stripping off his own
coat, accommodated Godfrey's naked shoulders; 
then after mature deliberation, they determined
to leave the spoil in the hands of the enemy, because
they foresaw it would be altogether impracticable
to retrieve it, as well as hazardous both
to their persons and reputation, to make any attempt
towards the recovery of what was lost; 
the two friends, therefore, made their retreat in
this trim to the garison, and the farmer remained
in possession of all the soldier's cloaths, sword and
ready money, to the amount of ten pounds. But
here the disaster did not end, the malicious peasant
propagated the whole story in the neighbourhood,
and an advertisement was pasted on the
church door, for the perusal of the whole parish,
giving a description of the goods, signifying the
place where they were found, and offering to
restore them to any person who should prove
himself the right owner. This was a mortifying
joke to Gauntlet, who was ashamed to shew
himself for a whole week; nor was Peregrine
exempted from a share of the disgrace, to which
he was exposed by the marks on his forehead,
that confined him also to the house, and subjected 

him to the ridicule of the commodore, who having
heard the story, rallied the two adventurers,
observing that it was well Gauntlet's mast had
not gone along with his rigging; and asking if
the cuckold's horns had run foul of Peregrine's
bows. Mrs. Trunnion, who chanced to be present,
very demurely checked her husband for his
profane scoffing, and in a severe lecture, rebuked
the young men for their profligate courses, which,
if they were not relinquished in time, would
bring their bodies into trouble in this life, and
their souls into perdition in that which is to come. 
While these fellow-sufferers were obliged to keep
within doors, they held frequent consultations
with the lieutenant, concerning some means of
revenge, which the soldier was bent upon taking; 
because he could not forgive the double dealing of
his mistress, who, he thought, might have declined
his solicitations, without inveigling him
into such a disgraceful situation. After much deliberation,
they resolved to wait patiently, and
watch for the husband's absence, when by a stratagem
they had concerted, they would endeavour
to obtain admittance, and punish the wife's
perfidy, by fixing her as a monument, with her
posteriors thrust out at a window, for the contemplation
of her spouse when he should return
in the morning. 
The plan being laid, Peregrine found means
to make himself acquainted with the farmer's
voice and manner of speaking, which he overheard
one night at Tunley's; and likewise to
procure information of the day upon which he
always went to a certain market, in order to dispose
of his wheat, at such a distance, that he
seldom failed of being abroad all night. According 

to this intelligence, the confederates attended
by Pipes, set out one evening about nine o'clock
for the house of the delinquent, where the lieutenant
and Tom being placed at different avenues
to prevent interruption, the two young gentlemen
approached the door which was locked,
and Peregrine in the rustic tone of the farmer demanded
entrance; the wife never doubting that
her husband was returned, in consequence of
having met with a speedier sale than usual, sent
her maid to let him in, and the door was no
sooner opened, than our adventurers rushed into
the house. The mistress was struck dumb with
consternation, mistaking them for robbers, because
they wore vizors, and were otherwise disguised; 
while the servant wench, terrified with
the same apprehension, fell upon her knees, and
begged they would spare her life and take all she
had. Gauntlet taking the wife by the hand, led
her trembling into that very chamber which had
been the scene of his misfortune, where pulling
off his mask, he upbraided her with the treachery
she had practised upon him, and intimated the
intention of his present visit. The lady asked
pardon for what she had done with such submission,
and deprecated his wrath so pathetically,
that his heart relented, and he proposed terms of
accommodation, which with some seeming reluctance
she embraced, and he forthwith enjoyed
a more agreeable revenge than that which he in
his ire had projected. 
Mean while Peregrine guessing the good fortune
of his friend, and allured by the attractions
of the maid, who was a cleanly florid girl, employed
his address to such effectual purpose, that 

she yielded to his efforts; and he was as happy as
such a conquest could make him. 
The soldier and his companion having thus obtained
all the satisfaction they required, and settled
a correspondence which they did not afterwards
neglect, retired in peace, applauding themselves
on their success, and found their two centinels
on their posts, whom they amused with a
feigned story of having been so much moved by
the tears and supplications of the criminal, that
they desisted from their scheme of exposing her,
and only inflicted the punishment of flagellation,
which, they said, she had undergone. 
Pipes was not well pleased when he found himself
disappointed in the expectation of seeing her
in the attitude to which she had been in council
decreed; and Hatchway, though he pretended to
acquiesce in their account, saw through the pretence,
and ascribed their long stay to the true
motive.
