Mrs. Norton, To Miss Howe. 

Saturday, May 13. 
Dear Madam,
My heart is almost broken to be obliged to let
you know, that such is the situation of things
in the family of my ever-dear Miss Harlowe, that
there can be at present no success expected from any
application in her favour. Her poor Mother is to be
pitied. I have a most affecting Letter from her; but
must not communicate it to you; and she forbids me
to let it be known that she writes upon the subject; 
although she is compelled, as it were, to do it, for
the ease of her own heart. I mention it therefore in
confidence. 
I hope in God that my beloved young Lady has
preserved her honour inviolate. I hope there is not
a man breathing, who could attempt a sacrilege so detestable. 
I have no apprehension of a failure in a virtue
so established. God for ever keep so pure a heart
out of the reach of surprizes and violence! Ease, dear
Madam, I beseech you, my over-anxious heart, by
one line, by the bearer, altho' but by one line, to acquaint
me (as surely you can) that her honour is unsullied. 
â€”If it be not, adieu to all the comforts this life
can give: Since none will it be able to afford 
To the poor Judith Norton.
