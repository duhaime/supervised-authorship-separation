Acquires employment, in consequence of a lucky
miscarriage. 
These ill offices, however, far from answering
her purpose, had a quite contrary
effect: for, in consequence of her invectives,
he was, in a few days, called to the wife
of a merchant, who piously hoped, that his
practice would not give Miss Biddy the lie. 
The patient had long lingered under a complication
of distempers, and being in no immediate 

danger of her life, doctor Fathom was in
no hurry to strike a decisive stroke; till the
husband growing impatient of delay, and so
explicite in his hints, that it was impossible to
misapprehend his meaning, our adventurer
resolved to do something effectual for his satisfaction,
and prescribed a medicine of such
rough operation, as, he thought, must either
oblige his employer, or produce a change in the
lady's constitution, that would make a noise in
the world, and bring a new accession to his
fame. 
Proceeding upon these maxims, he could not
be disappointed: the remedy played its part
with such violence, as reduced the patient to
extremity, and the merchant had actually bespoke
an undertaker; when, after a series of
swoonings and convulsions, nature so far prevailed,
as to expel, at once, the prescription
and the disease; yet the good-natured husband
was so much affected with the agonies to which
he saw the wife of his bosom exposed by this
specific, that, although the effect of it was her
perfect recovery, he never could bear the sight
of Fathom for the future, nor ever hear his
name mentioned, without giving signs of horror
and indignation; nay, he did not scruple
to affirm, that had our adventurer been endowed
with the least tincture of humanity, he
would have suffered the poor woman to depart
in peace, rather than restore her to health, at
the expence of such anxiety and torture. 
On the other hand, this extraordinary cure
was blazoned abroad by the good lady, and
her gossips, with such exaggerations as roused
the astonishment of the public, and concurred
with the report of his last miscarriage, to bring 

him upon the carpet, as the universal subject
of discourse. When a physician becomes the
town talk, he generally concludes his business
more than half done, even though his fame
should wholly turn upon his mal-practice; insomuch
that some members of the faculty have
been heard to complain, that they never had
the good fortune to be publickly accused of homicide; 
and it is well known, that a certain
famous empyrick, of our day, never flourished
to any degree of wealth and reputation, till after
he had been attacked in print, and fairly
convicted of having destroyed a good number
of the human species. Success raised upon
such a foundation, would, by a disciple of Plato,
and some modern moralists, be inscribed to
the innate virtue and generosity of the human
heart, which naturally espouses the cause that
needs protection: but I, whose notions of human
excellence are not quite so sublime, am
apt to believe it is owing to that spirit of self-conceit
and contradiction, which is, at least, as
universal, if not as natural, as the moral sense
so warmly contended for by those ideal philosophers. 
The most infamous wretch often finds his
account in these principles of malevolence and
self love: for wheresoever his character falls
under discussion, there is generally some person
present, who, either from an affectation
of singularity, or envy to the accusers, undertakes
his defence, and endeavours to invalidate
the articles of his impeachment, until he is
heated by altercation, and hurried into more
effectual measures for his advantage. If such
benefits accrue to those who have no real merit
to depend upon; surely, our hero could 

not but reap something extraordinary from the
debates to which he now gave rise; as by the
miraculous cure he had effected, all his patient's
friends, all the enemies of her husband,
all those who envied his other adversary, were
interested in his behalf, exclusive of such admirers
as surprize and curiosity might engage
in his cause. 
Thus wafted upon the wings of applause,
his fame soon diffused itself into all the corners
of this great capital: the news-papers
teemed with his praise; and in order to keep
up the attention of the public, his emissaries,
male and female, separated into different coffee
houses, companies, and clubs, where they
did not fail to comment upon these articles
of intelligence. Such a favourable incident
is, of itself, sufficient to float the bark of a
man's fortune: he was, in a few days, called
to another lady, labouring under the same disorder
he had so successfully dispelled, and she
thought herself benefited by his advice. His
acquaintance naturally extended itself among
the visitants and allies of his patients; he
was recommended from family to family:
the fees began to multiply; a variety of footmen
appeared every day at his door; he discontinued
his sham circuit, and looking upon
the present conjuncture, as that tide in his affairs,
which (according to Shakespeare) when
taken at the full, leads on to fortune, he resolved,
that the opportunity should not be lost,
and applied himself with such assiduity to his
practice, that, in all likelihood, he would have
carried the palm from all his contemporaries,
had not he split upon the same rock which had
shipwrecked his hopes before. 

We have formerly descanted upon that venereal
appetite, which glowed in the constitution
of our adventurer, and which all his philosophy
and caution could hardly keep within
bounds: the reader, therefore, will not be much
surprised, to learn, that, in the exercise of his
profession, he contracted an intimacy with a
clergyman's wife, whom he attended as a physician,
and whose conjugal virtue he subdued
by a long and diligent exertion of his delusive
arts, while her mind was enervated by sickness,
and her husband abroad upon his necessary
occasions. This unhappy patient, who was a
woman of an agreeable person, and lively conversation,
fell a sacrifice to her own security
and self-conceit: her want of health had confined
her to a sedentary life, and her imagination
being active and restless, she had spent
those hours in reading, which other young
women devote to company and diversion:
but, as her studies were not superintended by
any person of taste, she had indulged her
own fancy without method or propriety. The
Spectator taught her to be a critic and philosopher; 
from plays she learned poetry and
wit: and derived her knowledge of life from
books of history and adventures. Fraught
with these acquisitions, and furnished by nature
with uncommon vivacity, she despised her
own sex, and courted the society of men, among
whom she thought her talents might be
more honourably displayed; fully confident of
her own virtue and sagacity, which enabled her
to set all their arts at defiance. 
Thus qualified, she, in an evil hour, had
recourse to the advice of our adventurer, for
some ailment under which she had long laboured; 

and found such relief from his skill,
as very much prepossessed her in his favour:
she was no less pleased with his obliging manners,
than with his physick; and found much
entertainment in his conversation, so that the
acquaintance proceeded to a degree of intimacy; 
during which he perceived her weak side,
and being enamoured of her person, flattered
her out of all her caution: The privilege of
his character furnished him with opportunities
to lay snares for her virtue, and taking advantage
of that listlessness, languor, and indolence
of the spirits, by which all the vigilance of the
soul is relaxed, he, after a long course of attention
and perseverance, found means to make
shipwreck of her peace. 
Though he mastered her chastity, he could
not quiet her conscience, which incessantly upbraided
her with breach of the marriage vow; 
nor did her undoer escape without a share of
the reproaches suggested by her penitence and
remorse. This internal anxiety co-operating
with her disease, and, perhaps, with the medicines
he prescribed, reduced her to the brink
of the grave; when her husband returned from
a neighbouring kingdom, in consequence of
her earnest request, joined to the information
of her friends, who had written to him an account
of the extremity in which she was. The
good man was afflicted beyond measure, when
he saw himself upon the verge of losing a wife,
whom he had always tenderly loved: but, what
were his emotions, when she, taking the first
opportunity of his being alone with her, accosted
him to this effect: “I am now hastening
towards that dissolution, from which no mortal
is exempted; and though the prospect of futurity 

is altogether clouded and uncertain, my
conscience will not allow me to plunge into
eternity, without unburthening my mind, and
by an ingenuous confession, making all the
atonement in my power, for the ingratitude I
have been guilty of, and the wrongs I have committed
against a virtuous husband, who never
gave me cause of complaint. You stand amazed
at this preamble; but, alas! how will you be
shocked, when I own that I have betrayed you in
your absence; that I have trespassed against God
and my marriage-vow, and fallen from the
pride and confidence of virtue, to the most abject
state of vice: yes, I have been unfaithful to
your bed, having fallen a victim to the infernal
insinuations of a villain, who took advantage of
my weak and unguarded moments. Fathom is
the wretch who hath thus injured your honour,
and ruined my unsuspecting innocence. I have
nothing to plead in alleviation of my crime, but
the most sincere contrition of heart; and tho'
at any other juncture, I could not expect your
forgiveness, yet, as I now touch the goal of life,
I trust in your humanity and benevolence, for
that pardon which will lighten the sorrows of
my soul, and those prayers which I hope will
entitle me to favour at the throne of grace.” 
The poor husband was so much overwhelmed
with grief and confusion, at this unexpected
address, that he could not recollect himself, till
after a pause of several minutes, when uttering
a hollow groan, “I will not (said he) aggravate
your sufferings, by reproaching you with my
wrongs; though your conduct hath been but
an ill return for all my tenderness and esteem
I look upon it as a trial of my christian patience,
and bear my misfortune with resignation: 

mean while, I forgive you from my heart,
and fervently pray, that your repentance may
be acceptable to the father of mercy.” So saying,
he approached her bed side, and embraced
her in token of his sincerity. Whether this
generous condescension diffused such a composure
upon her spirits, as tended to the ease and
refreshment of nature, which had been almost
exhausted by disease and vexation; certain it
is, that, from this day, she began to struggle
with her malady in surprising efforts; and
hourly gained ground, until her health was
pretty well re-established. 
This recovery was so far beyond the husband's
expectation, that he began to make very
serious reflections on the event, and even to wish
he had not been quite so precipitate in pardoning
the backslidings of his wife: for, though
he could not withhold his compassion from a
dying penitent, he did not at all relish the
thoughts of cohabiting, as usual, with a wife,
self-convicted of the violation of the matrimonial
contract: he therefore considered his declaration
as no more than a provisional pardon,
to take place on condition of her immediate
death; and, in a little time, not only communicated
to her his sentiments on this subject; 
but also separated himself from her company,
secured the evidence of her maid, who had been
confidante in her amour with Fathom, and immediately
set on foot a prosecution against our
adventurer, whose behaviour to his wife he
did not fail to promulgate, with all its aggravating
circumstances. By these means the doctor's
name became so notorious, that every man was
afraid of admitting him into his house, and
every woman ashamed of solliciting his advice.
