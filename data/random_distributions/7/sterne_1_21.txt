I am apt to be taken with all kinds
of people at first sight; but never
more so, than when a poor devil
comes to offer his service to so poor a
devil as myself; and as I know this
weakness, I always suffer my judgment
to draw back something on that
very account—and this more or less,
according to the mood I am in, and
the case—and I may add the gender
too, of the person I am to govern. 
When La Fleur enter'd the room,
after every discount I could make for
my soul, the genuine look and air of 

the fellow determined the matter at
once in his favour; so I hired him
first—and then began to inquire what
he could do: But I shall find out his
talents, quoth I, as I want them— 
besides, a Frenchman can do every
thing. 
Now poor La Fleur could do nothing
in the world but beat a drum,
and play a march or two upon the
fife. I was determined to make his
talents do; and can't say my weakness
was ever so insulted by my wisdom,
as in the attempt. 
La Fleur had set out early in life,
as gallantly as most Frenchmen do,
with serving for a few years; at the end 

of which, having satisfied the sentiment,
and found moreover, That the
honour of beating a drum was likely
to be its own reward, as it open'd no
further track of glory to him—he
retired a ses terres, and lived comme
il plaisoit a Dieu—that is to say, upon
nothing. 
—And so, quoth Wisdome, you
have hired a drummer to attend you
in this tour of your's thro' France
and Italy! Psha! said I, and do
not one half of our gentry go with a
hum-drum compagnon du voiage the
same round, and have the piper and
the devil and all to pay besides? 
When man can extricate himself with 

an equivoque in such an unequal match
—he is not ill of —But you can do
something else, La Fleur? said I — 
—O qu'oui!—he could make spatterdashes,
and play a little upon the
siddle —Bravo! said Wisdome —Why,
I play a bass myself, said I—we shall
do very well. —You can shave, and
dress a wig a little, La Fleur? —He
had all the dispositions in the world — 
It is enough for heaven! said I, interrupting
him—and ought to be
enough for me —So supper coming
in, and having a frisky English spaniel
on one side of my chair, and a
French valet, with as much hilarity
in his countenance as ever nature
painted in one, on the other —I was 

satisfied to my heart's content with
my empire; and if monarchs knew
what they would be at, they might
be as satisfied as I was.
