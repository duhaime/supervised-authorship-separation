Miss Howe, To Miss Arabella Harlowe. 

Thursday, July 20. 
Miss Harlowe,
I cannot help acquainting you, however it may be received,
as coming from me, that your poor sister is dangerously
ill, at the house of one Smith, who keeps a glover's and 

perfume-shop, in King-street, Covent-Garden. She knows
not that I write. Some violent words, in the nature of
an imprecation, from her father, afflict her greatly in her
weak state. I presume not to direct to you what to do in
this case. You are her sister. I therefore could not help
writing to you, not only for her sake, but for your own. 
I am, Madam,
Your humble Servant,
Anna Howe.
