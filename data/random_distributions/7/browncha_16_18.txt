Before I reached the city it was du&longs;k. It was
my purpo&longs;e to &longs;pend the night at Mettingen. I
was not &longs;olicitous, as long as I was attended by a
faithful &longs;ervant, to be there at an early hour. My
exhau&longs;ted &longs;trength required me to take &longs;ome refreshment.
With this view, and in order to pay re&longs;pect
to one who&longs;e affection for me was truly maternal,
I &longs;topped at Mrs. Baynton's. She was ab&longs;ent from
home; but I had &longs;carcely entered the hou&longs;e when
one of her dome&longs;tics pre&longs;ented me a letter. I opened
and read as follows:
“To Clara Wieland,
“What &longs;hall I &longs;ay to extenuate the mi&longs;conduct
of la&longs;t night? It is my duty to repair it to the
utmo&longs;t of my power, but the only way in which
it can be repaired, you will not, I fear, be prevailed
on to adopt. It is by granting me an interview, at
your own hou&longs;e, at eleven o'clock this night. I
have no means of removing any fears that you may
entertain of my de&longs;igns, but my &longs;imple and &longs;olemn
declarations. The&longs;e, after what has pa&longs;&longs;ed between
us, you may deem unworthy of confidence. I
cannot help it. My folly and ra&longs;hne&longs;s has left me
no other re&longs;ource. I will be at your door by that
hour. If you chu&longs;e to admit me to a conference,
provided that conference has no witne&longs;&longs;es, I will disclose
to you particulars, the knowledge of which
is of the utmo&longs;t importance to your happine&longs;s.
Farewell.
CAR WIN.”






What a letter was this! A man known to be
an a&longs;&longs;a&longs;&longs;in and robber; one capable of plotting
again&longs;t my life and my fame; detected lurking in my
chamber, and avowing de&longs;igns the mo&longs;t flagitious
and dreadful, now &longs;olicits me to grant him a midnight
interview! To admit him alone into my presence!
Could he make this reque&longs;t with the expectation
of my compliance? What had he &longs;een
in me, that could ju&longs;tify him in admitting &longs;o wild a
belief? Yet this reque&longs;t is preferred with the utmo&longs;t
gravity. It is not accompanied by an appearance
of uncommon earne&longs;tne&longs;s. Had the mi&longs;conduct
to which he alludes been a &longs;light incivility, and
the interview reque&longs;ted to take place in the mid&longs;t
of my friends, there would have been no extravagance
in the tenor of this letter; but, as it was, the
writer had &longs;urely been bere&longs;t of his rea&longs;on.
I peru&longs;ed this epi&longs;tle frequently. The reque&longs;t it
contained might be called audacious or &longs;tupid, if it
had been made by a different per&longs;on; but from
Carwin, who could not be unaware of the effect
which it mu&longs;t naturally produce, and of the manner
in which it would unavoidably be treated, it was
perfectly inexplicable. He mu&longs;t have counted on
the &longs;ucce&longs;s of &longs;ome plot, in order to extort my
a&longs;&longs;ent. None of tho&longs;e motives by which I am
u&longs;ually governed would ever have per&longs;uaded me
to meet any one of his &longs;ex, at the time and place
which he had pre&longs;cribed. Much le&longs;s would I consent
to a meeting with a man, tainted with the mo&longs;t
dete&longs;table crimes, and by who&longs;e arts my own &longs;afety
had been &longs;o imminently endangered, and my happiness
irretrievably de&longs;troyed. I &longs;huddered at the
idea that &longs;uch a meeting was po&longs;&longs;ible. I felt &longs;ome
reluctance to approach a &longs;pot which he &longs;till vi&longs;ited
and haunted.







Such were the ideas which fir&longs;t &longs;ugge&longs;ted themselves
on the peru&longs;al of the letter. Meanwhile, I
re&longs;umed my journey. My thoughts &longs;till dwelt upon
the &longs;ame topic. Gradually from ruminating on
this epi&longs;tle, I reverted to my interview with Pleyel.
I recalled the particulars of the dialogue to which
he had been an auditor. My heart &longs;unk anew on
viewing the inextricable complexity of this deception,
and the inau&longs;picious concurrence of events,
which tended to confirm him in his error. When
he approached my chamber door, my terror kept
me mute. He put his ear, perhaps, to the crevice,
but it caught the &longs;ound of nothing human. Had I
called, or made any token that denoted &longs;ome one to
be within, words would have en&longs;ued; and as omnipresence
was impo&longs;&longs;ible, this di&longs;covery, and the artless
narrative of what had ju&longs;t pa&longs;&longs;ed, would have
&longs;aved me from his murderous invectives. He went
into his chamber, and after &longs;ome interval, I &longs;tole
acro&longs;s the entry and down the &longs;tairs, with inaudible
&longs;teps. Having &longs;ecured the outer doors, I returned
with le&longs;s circum&longs;pection. He heard me not when I
de&longs;cended; but my returning &longs;teps were ea&longs;ily distinguished.
Now he thought was the guilty interview
at an end. In what other way was it po&longs;&longs;ible
for him to con&longs;true the&longs;e &longs;ignals?
How fallacious and precipitate was my deci&longs;ion!
Carwin's plot owed its &longs;ucce&longs;s to a coincidence of
events &longs;carcely credible. The balance was &longs;wayed
from its equipoi&longs;e by a hair. Had I even begun
the conver&longs;ation with an account of what be&longs;el me
in my chamber, my previous interview with Wieland
would have taught him to &longs;u&longs;pect me of imposture;
yet, if I were di&longs;cour&longs;ing with this ruffian,
when Pleyel touched the lock of my chamber door,
and when he &longs;hut his own door with &longs;o much




violence, how, he might a&longs;k, &longs;hould I be able to relate
the&longs;e incidents? Perhaps he had withheld the
knowledge of the&longs;e circum&longs;tances from my brother,
from whom, therefore, I could not obtain it, &longs;o that
my innocence would have thus been irre&longs;i&longs;tibly demonstrated.

The fir&longs;t impul&longs;e which flowed from the&longs;e ideas
was to return upon my &longs;teps, and demand once
more an interview; but he was gone: his parting
declarations were remembered.
Pleyel, I exclaimed, thou art gone for ever! Are
thy mi&longs;takes beyond the reach of detection? Am
I helple&longs;s in the mid&longs;t of this &longs;nare? The plotter
is at hand. He even &longs;peaks in the &longs;tyle of penitence.
He &longs;olicits an interview which he promi&longs;es
&longs;hall end in the di&longs;clo&longs;ure of &longs;omething momentous
to my happine&longs;s. What can he &longs;ay which will
avail to turn a&longs;ide this evil? But why &longs;hould his
remor&longs;e be feigned? I have done him no injury.
His wickedne&longs;s is fertile only of de&longs;pair; and the
billows of remor&longs;e will &longs;ome time overbear him.
Why may not this event have already taken place?
Why &longs;hould I refu&longs;e to &longs;ee him?
This idea was pre&longs;ent, as it were, for a moment.
I &longs;uddenly recoiled from it, con&longs;ounded at that
frenzy which could give even momentary harbour
to &longs;uch a &longs;cheme; yet pre&longs;ently it returned. A
length I even conceived it to de&longs;erve deliberation.
I que&longs;tioned whether it was not proper to admit, at
a lonely &longs;pot, in a &longs;acred hour, this man of tremendous
and in&longs;crutable attributes, this performer of
horrid deeds, and who&longs;e pre&longs;ence was predicted to
call down unheard-of and unutterable horrors.
What was it that &longs;wayed me? I &longs;elt my&longs;elf divested
of the power to will contrary to the motives
that determined me to &longs;eek his pre&longs;ence. My mind




&longs;eemed to be &longs;plit into &longs;eparate parts, and the&longs;e parts
to have entered into &longs;urious and implacable contention.
The&longs;e tumults gradually &longs;ub&longs;ided. The
rea&longs;ons why I &longs;hould con&longs;ide in that interposition
which had hitherto defended me; in tho&longs;e
tokens of compunction which this letter contained;
in the efficacy of this interview to re&longs;tore its spotlessness
to my character, and bani&longs;h all illu&longs;ions
from the mind of my friend, continually acquired
new evidence and new &longs;trength.
What &longs;hould I fear in his pre&longs;ence? This was
unlike an artifice intended to betray me into his
hands. If it were an artifice, what purpo&longs;e would
it &longs;erve? The freedom of my mind was untouched,
and that freedom would de&longs;y the a&longs;&longs;aults of
blandi&longs;hments or magic. Force was I not able
to repel. On the former occa&longs;ion my courage,
it is true, had failed at the imminent approach of
danger; but then I had not enjoyed opportunities of
deliberation; I had fore&longs;een nothing; I was &longs;unk
into imbecility by my previous thoughts; I had
been the victim of recent di&longs;appointments and anticipated
ills: Witne&longs;s my infatuation in opening
the clo&longs;et in oppo&longs;ition to divine injunctions.
Now, perhaps, my courage was the offspring
of a no le&longs;s erring principle. Pleyel was for ever
lo&longs;t to me. I &longs;trove in vain to a&longs;&longs;ume his per&longs;on,
and &longs;uppre&longs;s my re&longs;entment; I &longs;trove in vain to believe
in the a&longs;&longs;uaging influence of time, to look
forward to the birth-day of new hopes, and the reexaltation
of that luminary, of who&longs;e effulgencies
I had &longs;o long and &longs;o liberally partaken.
What had I to &longs;uffer wor&longs;e than was already
inflicted?
Was not Carwin my &longs;oe? I owed my untimely
&longs;ate to his trea&longs;on. In&longs;tead of flying from his




presence, ought I not to devote all my faculties to the
gaining of an interview, and compel him to repair
the ills of which he has been the author? Why
&longs;hould I &longs;uppo&longs;e him impregnable to argument?
Have I not rea&longs;on on my &longs;ide, and the power of
imparting conviction? Cannot he be made to &longs;ee
the ju&longs;tice of unravelling the maze in which Pleyel
is bewildered?
He may, at lea&longs;t, be acce&longs;&longs;ible to fear. Has he
nothing to fear from the rage of an injured woman?
But &longs;uppo&longs;e him inacce&longs;&longs;ible to &longs;uch inducements;
&longs;uppo&longs;e him to per&longs;i&longs;t in all his flagitious purposes;
are not the means of defence and re&longs;i&longs;tance
in my power?
In the progre&longs;s of &longs;uch thoughts, was the resolution
at la&longs;t formed. I hoped that the interview was
&longs;ought by him for a laudable end; but, be that as
it would, I tru&longs;ted that, by energy of rea&longs;oning or
of action, I &longs;hould render it au&longs;picious, or, at lea&longs;t,
harmle&longs;s.
Such a determination mu&longs;t unavoidably fluctuate.
The poet's chaos was no unapt emblem of the &longs;tate
of my mind. A torment was awakened in my
bo&longs;om, which I fore&longs;aw would end only when this
interview was pa&longs;t, and its con&longs;equences fully experienced.
Hence my impatience for the arrival
of the hour which had been pre&longs;cribed by Carwin.
Meanwhile, my meditations were tumultuou&longs;ly
active. New impediments to the execution of the
&longs;cheme were &longs;peedily &longs;ugge&longs;ted. I had apprized
Catharine of my intention to &longs;pend this and many
future nights with her. Her hu&longs;band was informed
of this arrangement, and had zealou&longs;ly approved
it. Eleven o'clock exceeded their hour of retiring.
What excu&longs;e &longs;hould I form for changing my plan?
Should I &longs;hew this letter to Wieland, and &longs;ubmit





my&longs;elf to his direction? But I knew in what way
he would decide. He would &longs;ervently di&longs;&longs;uade me
from going. Nay, would he not do more? He
was apprized of the offences of Carwin, and of
the reward offered for his apprehen&longs;ion. Would
he not &longs;eize this opportunity of executing ju&longs;tice
on a criminal?
This idea was new. I was plunged once more
into doubt. Did not equity enjoin me thus to facilitate
his arre&longs;t? No. I di&longs;dained the office of
betrayer. Carwin was unapprized of his danger,
and his intentions were po&longs;&longs;ibly beneficent. Should
I &longs;tation guards about the hou&longs;e, and make an act,
intended perhaps for my benefit, in&longs;trumental to
his own de&longs;truction? Wieland might be ju&longs;tified
in thus employing the knowledge which I &longs;hould
impart, but I, by imparting it, &longs;hould pollute my&longs;elf
with more hateful crimes than tho&longs;e unde&longs;ervedly
imputed to me. This &longs;cheme, therefore, I unhesitatingly
rejected. The views with which I &longs;hould
return to my own hou&longs;e, it would therefore be necessary
to conceal. Yet &longs;ome pretext mu&longs;t be invented.
I had never been initiated into the trade
of lying. Yet what but fal&longs;hood was a deliberate
&longs;uppre&longs;&longs;ion of the truth? To deceive by &longs;ilence or
by words is the &longs;ame.
Yet what would a lie avail me? What pretext
would ju&longs;tify this change in my plan? Would it
not tend to confirm the imputations of Pleyel?
That I &longs;hould voluntarily return to an hou&longs;e in
which honor and life had &longs;o lately been endangered,
could be explained in no way favorable to my
integrity.
The&longs;e reflections, if they did not change, at lea&longs;t
&longs;u&longs;pended my deci&longs;ion. In this &longs;tate of uncertainty
I alighted at the hut. We gave this name to the




hou&longs;e tenanted by the farmer and his &longs;ervants, and
which was &longs;ituated on the verge of my brother's
ground, and at a con&longs;iderable di&longs;tance from the mansion.
The path to the man&longs;ion was planted by a
double row of walnuts. Along this path I proceeded
alone. I entered the parlour, in which was
a light ju&longs;t expiring in the &longs;ocket. There was no
one in the room. I perceived by the clock that
&longs;tood again&longs;t the wall, that it was near eleven. The
latene&longs;s of the hour &longs;tartled me. What had become
of the family? They were u&longs;ually retired
an hour before this; but the unextingui&longs;hed taper,
and the unbarred door were indications that they
had not retired. I again returned to the hall, and
pa&longs;&longs;ed from one room to another, but &longs;till encountered
not a human being.
I imagined that, perhaps, the lap&longs;e of a few minutes
would explain the&longs;e appearances. Meanwhile
I reflected that the preconcerted hour had
arrived. Carwin was perhaps waiting my approach.
Should I immediately retire to my own hou&longs;e, no
one would be apprized of my proceeding. Nay,
the interview might pa&longs;s, and I be enabled to return
in half an hour. Hence no nece&longs;&longs;ity would ari&longs;e
for di&longs;&longs;imulation.
I was &longs;o far influenced by the&longs;e views that I ro&longs;e
to execute this de&longs;ign; but again the unu&longs;ual condition
of the hou&longs;e occurred to me, and &longs;ome vague
&longs;olicitude as to the condition of the family. I was
nearly certain that my brother had not retired; but
by what motives he could be induced to de&longs;ert his
hou&longs;e thus un&longs;ea&longs;onably, I could by no means
divine. Loui&longs;a Conway, at lea&longs;t, was at home, and
had, probably, retired to her chamber; perhaps &longs;he
was able to impart the information I wanted.
I went to her chamber, and found her a&longs;leep.




She was delighted and &longs;urprized at my arrival, and
told me with how much impatience and anxiety
my brother and his wife had waited my coming.
They were fearful that &longs;ome mi&longs;hap had befallen
me, and had remained up longer than the u&longs;ual
period. Notwith&longs;tanding the latene&longs;s of the hour,
Catharine would not re&longs;ign the hope of &longs;eeing me.
Loui&longs;a &longs;aid &longs;he had left them both in the parlour,
and &longs;he knew of no cau&longs;e for their ab&longs;ence.
As yet I was not without &longs;olicitude on account
of their per&longs;onal &longs;afety. I was far from being perfectly
at ea&longs;e on that head, but entertained no distinct
conception of the danger that impended over
them. Perhaps to beguile the moments of my long
protracted &longs;tay, they had gone to walk upon the
bank. The atmo&longs;phere, though illuminated only
by the &longs;tar-light, was remarkably &longs;erene. Meanwhile
the de&longs;ireablene&longs;s of an interview with Carwin
again returned, and I finally re&longs;olved to &longs;eek
it.
I pa&longs;&longs;ed with doubting and ha&longs;ty &longs;teps along the
path. My dwelling, &longs;een at a di&longs;tance, was gloomy
and de&longs;olate. It had no inhabitant, for my &longs;ervant,
in con&longs;equence of my new arrangement, had gone
to Mettingen. The temerity of this attempt began
to &longs;hew it&longs;elf in more vivid colours to my understanding.
Whoever has pointed &longs;teel is not without
arms; yet what mu&longs;t have been the &longs;tate of my
mind when I could meditate, without &longs;huddering,
on the u&longs;e of a murderous weapon, and believe myself
&longs;ecure merely becau&longs;e I was capable of being
made &longs;o by the death of another? Yet this was
not my &longs;tate. I felt as if I was ru&longs;hing into deadly
toils, without the power of pau&longs;ing or receding.
