La Fleur had left me something
to amuse myself with for the
day more than I had bargain'd for,
or could have enter'd either into his
head or mine. 
He had brought the little print of
butter upon a currant leaf; and as
the morning was warm, and he had
a good step to bring it, he had
begg'd a sheet of waste paper to put
betwixt the currant leaf and his hand
—As that was plate sufficient, I bad
him lay it upon the table as it was, 

and as I resolved to stay within all
day I ordered him to call upon the
traiteur to bespeak my dinner, and
leave me to breakfast by myself. 
When I had finish'd the butter,
I threw the currant leaf out of the
window, and was going to do the same
by the waste paper—but stopping to
read a line first, and that drawing me
on to a second and third—I thought
it better worth; so I shut the window,
and drawing a chair up to it, I sat
down to read it. 
It was in the old French of Rabelais's
time, and for aught I know might
have been wrote by him—it was
moreover in a Gothic letter, and that 

so faded and gone off by damps and
length of time, it cost me infinite
trouble to make any thing of it— 
I threw it down; and then wrote a
letter to Eugenius—then I took it up
again, and embroiled my patience with
it afresh—and then to cure that, I
wrote a letter to Eliza. —Still it kept
hold of me; and the difficulty of understanding
it increased but the
desire. 
I got my dinner; and after I had
enlightened my mind with a bottle of
Burgundy, I at it again—and after
two or three hours pouring upon it,
with almost as deep attention as ever
Gruter or Jacob Spon did upon a
nonsensical inscription, I thought I 

made sense of it; but to make sure
of it, the best way, I imagined, was
to turn it into English, and see how
it would look then—so I went on
leisurely, as a trifling man does, sometimes
writing a sentence—then taking
a turn or two—and then looking how
the world went, out of the window; 
so that it was nine o'clock at night
before I had done it—I then begun
and read it as follows.
