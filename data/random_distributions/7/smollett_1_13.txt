He effects a lodgment in the house of a rich Jeweller. 
In consequence of this determination, he to
the uttermost exerted his good humour among
the few friends of consequence his fortune
had left, and even carried his complaisance
so far, as to become the humble servant
of their pleasures; while he attempted to extend
his acquaintance in an inferior path of life,
where he thought his talents would shine more
conspicuous than at the assemblies of the great,
and conduce more effectually to the interest of
all his designs. Nor did he find himself disappointed
in that expectation, sanguine as it
was. He soon found means to be introduced
to the house of a wealthy bourgeois, where
every individual was charmed with his easy air
and extraordinary qualifications. He accommodated
himself surprisingly to the humours
of the whole family; smoaked tobacco, swallowed
wine, and discoursed of stones with the
husband, who was a rich jeweller; sacrificed
himself to the pride and loquacity of the wife,
and played upon the violen, and sung alternately,
for the amusement of his only daughter,
a buxom lass, nearly of his own age, the
fruit of a former marriage. 

It was not long before Ferdinand had reason
to congratulate himself on the footing he had
gained in this society. He had expected to
find, and in a little time actually discovered
that mutual jealousy and rancour, which almost
always subsist between a daughter and her step-dame,
inflamed with all the virulence of female
emulation; for the disparity in their ages,
served only to render them the more inveterate
rivals in the desire of captivating the
other sex. Our adventurer having deliberated
upon the means of converting this animosity to
his own advantage, saw no method for this
purpose so feasible, as that of making his approaches
to the hearts of both, by ministring
to each in private, food for their reciprocal
envy and malevolence: because he well knew
that no road lies so direct and open to a woman's
heart, as that of gratifying her passions
of vanity and resentment. 
When he had an opportunity of being particular
with the mother, he expressed his concern
for having unwittingly incurred the displeasure
of Mademoiselle, which, he observed,
was obvious in every circumstance of her behaviour
towards him; protesting he was utterly
innocent of all intention of offending her; 
and that he could not account for his disgrace,
any other way, than by supposing she took
umbrage at the direction of his chief regards
towards her mother-in-law, which, he owned,
was altogether involuntary, being wholly influenced
by that lady's superior charms and politeness. 
Such a declaration was perfectly well calculated
for the meridian of a dame like her, who
with all the intoxication of unenlightened 

pride, and an increased appetite for pleasure,
had begun to find herself neglected, and even
to believe that her attractions were actually in
the wane. She very graciously consoled our
gallant for the mishap of which he complained; 
representing Wilhelmina (that was the
daughter's name) as a pert, illiterate, envious
baggage, of whose disgust he ought to make
no consideration; then she recounted many instances
of her own generosity to that young lady,
with the returns of malice and ingratitude
she had made; and lastly, enumerated all the
imperfections of her person, education, and
behaviour; that he might see with what justice
the gypsy pretended to vye with those who had
been distinguished by the approbation, and
even gallantry of the best people in Vienna. 
Having thus established himself her confident
and gossip, he knew his next step of promotion
would necessarily be to the degree of
her lover; and in that belief, resolved to play
the same game with Mademoiselle. Wilhelmina,
whose complexion was very much a-kin to
that of her step-mother: indeed they resembled
each other too much to live upon any
terms of friendship or even decorum. Fathom,
in order to enjoy a private conversation
with the young lady, never failed to repeat his
visit every afternoon, 'till at length he had the
pleasure of finding her disengaged, the jeweller
being occupied among his workmen, and
his wife gone to assist at a lying-in. 
Our adventurer and the daughter had already
exchanged their vows, by the expressive
language of the eyes; he had even declared
himself in some tender ejaculations which had 

been softly whispered in her ear, when he
could snatch an opportunity of venting them,
unperceived; nay, he had upon divers occasions,
gently squeezed her fair hand, on pretence
of tuning her harpsichord, and being favoured
with returns of the same cordial pressure:
so that instead of accosting her with the
fearful hesitation and reserve of a timid swain,
he told her, after the exercise of the doux-yeux,
that he was come to confer with her upon
a subject that nearly concerned her peace; 
and asked if she had not observed of late, an
evident abatement of friendship in her mother's
behaviour to him, whom she had formerly
treated with such marks of favour and
respect. Mademoiselle would not pay so ill
a compliment, to her own discernment as to say
she had not perceived the alteration, which,
on the contrary, she owned was extremely palpable; 
nor was it difficult to divine the cause
of such estranged looks. This remark was accompanied
with an irresistible glance, she smiled
inchanting, the colour deepened on her
cheeks, her breasts began to heave, and her
whole frame underwent a most agreeable confusion. 
Ferdinand was not a man to let such a favourable
conjuncture pass unregarded. “Yes,
charming Wilhelmina! exclaimed the politician
in an affected rapture, the cause is as conspicuous
as your attractions. She hath, in spite
of all my circumspection, perceived that passion
which it is not in my power to conceal, and in
consequence of which, I now declare myself
your devoted adorer; or, conscious of your
superior excellence, her jealousy hath taken 

the alarm, and though stung with conjecture
only, repines at the triumph of your perfections. 
How far this spirit of malignity may
be inflamed to my prejudice, I know not: perhaps
as this is the first, it may be also the last
opportunity, I shall have of avowing the dearest
sentiments of my heart, to the fair object
that inspired them; in a word, I may be for
ever excluded from your presence. Excuse
me then, divine creature! from the practice
of those unnecessary forms, which I should
take pride in observing, were I indulged with
the ordinary privileges of an honourable lover; 
and once for all, accept the homage of an heart
overflowing with love and admiration. Yes,
adorable Wilhelmina! I am dazzled with your
supernatural beauty; your other accomplishments
strike me with wonder and awe. I am
enchanted by the graces of your deportment,
ravished with the charms of your conversation; 
and there is a certain tenderness of benevolence
in that endearing aspect, which, I trust, will not
fail to melt with sympathy at the emotions of
a faithful slave like me.” 
So saying, he threw himself upon his knees,
and seizing her plump hand, pressed it to his lips
with all the violence of real transport. The
nymph, whose passions nature had filled to the
brim, could not hear such a rhapsody unmoved:
being an utter stranger to addresses of this kind,
she understood every word of it, in the literal
acceptation; she believed implicitly in the truth
of the encomiums he had bestowed, and thought
it reasonable he should be rewarded for the justice
he had done to her qualifications which had
hitherto been almost altogether over-looked: 

in short, her heart began to thaw, and her face
to hang out the flag of capitulation, which was
no sooner perceived by our hero, than he renewed
his attack with redoubled fervour, pronouncing
in a most vehement tone, “Light of
my eyes, and empress of my soul! behold me
prostrate at your feet, waiting with the most
pious resignation, for that sentence from your
lips, on which my future happiness and misery
must altogether depend. Not with more reverence
does the unhappy Bashaw kiss the Sultan's
letter that contains his doom, than I will submit
to your fatal determination. Speak then, angelic
sweetness! for, never, ah never will I rise
from this suppliant posture, until I am encouraged
to live and hope. No! If you refuse to
smile upon my passion, here shall I breathe the
last sighs of a despairing lover: here shall this
faithful sword do the last office to its unfortunate
master, and shed the blood of the truest
heart that ever felt the cruel pangs of disappointed
love.” 
The young lady, well nigh overcome by this
effusion, which brought the tears into her eyes,
“Enough, enough, cried she, interrupting
him, sure you men were created for the ruin of
our sex.” “Ruin, re-ecchoed Fathom, talk
not of ruin and Wilhelmina! let these terms
be for ever parted, far as the east and west asunder!
let ever smiling peace attend her steps,
and love and joy still wanton in her train! 
Ruin indeed shall wait upon her enemies, if
such there be, and those love lorn wretches
who pine with anguish under her disdain: grant
me, kind Heaven a more propitious boon: direct
her genial regards to one whose love is 

without example, and whose constancy is unparalled:
bear witness to my constancy and
faith, ye verdant hills, ye fertile plains, ye
shady groves, ye purling streams: and if I prove
untrue, ah! let me never find a solitary willow
or a bubling brook, by help of which I
may be enabled to put a period to my wretched
life.” 
Here this excellent actor began to sob most
piteously, and the tender hearted Wilhelmina,
unable longer to withstand his moving tale,
with a repetition of the interjection, ah! gently
dropp'd into his arms. This was the beginning
of a correspondence that soon rose to a very interesting
pitch; and they forthwith concerted
measures for carrying it on, without the knowledge
or suspicion of her mother-in-law. Nevertheless
the young lady, vanquished as she
was, and unskilled in the ways of men, would
not all at once yield at discretion; but insisted
upon those terms, without which no woman's
reputation can be secured. Our lover, far from
seeking to evade the proposal, assented to it in
terms of uncommon satisfaction, and promised
to use his whole industry in finding a priest,
upon whose discretion they could rely; nay,
he certainly resolved to comply with her request
in good earnest, rather than forfeit the
advantages which he foresaw in their union. 
His good fortune, however, exempted him from
the necessity of taking such a step, which at
best must have been disagreeable: for so many
difficulties occurred in the enquiry which
was set on foot, and so artfully did Fathom in
the mean time manage the influence he had already
gained over her heart, that before her 

passion could obtain a legal gratification, she
surrendered to his wish, without any other assurance,
than his solemn profession of sincerity
and truth, on which she reposed herself with
the most implicit confidence and faith.
