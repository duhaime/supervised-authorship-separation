Mr. Villars to Evelina. 
Berry-Hill, March 28. 
To resist the urgency of entreaty, is
a power which I have not yet acquired:
I aim not at an authority which
deprives you of liberty, yet I would fain
guide myself by a prudence which should
save me the pangs of repentance. Your
impatience to fly to a place which your
imagination has painted to you in colours
so attractive, surprises me not; I have only
to hope that the liveliness of your fancy
may not deceive you: to refuse, would be
to raise it still higher. To see my Evelina
happy, is to see myself without a wish: go
then, my child, and may that Heaven
which alone can, direct, preserve, and
strengthen you! To That, my love, will
I daily offer prayers for your felicity; O
may it guard, watch over you! defend you
from danger, save you from distress, and
keep vice as distant from your person as
from your heart! And to Me, may it grant
the ultimate blessing of closing these aged
eyes in the arms of one so dearâ€”so deservedly
beloved! 
Arthur Villars.
