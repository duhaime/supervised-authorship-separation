The next morning La Fleur
entering upon his employment,
I delivered to him the key of
my portmanteau with an inventory of
my half a dozen shirts and silk pair
of breeches; and bid him fasten all
upon the chaise—get the horses put
to—and desire the landlord to come
in with his bill. 
C'est un garçon de bonne fortune,
said the landlord, pointing through
the window to half a dozen wenches
who had got round about La Fleur,
and were most kindly taking their
leave of him, as the postilion was
leading out the horses. La Fleur 

kissed all their hands round and
round again, and thrice he wiped his
eyes, and thrice he promised he would
bring them all pardons from Rome. 
The young fellow, said the landlord,
is beloved by all the town, and
there is scarce a corner in Montriul
where the want of him will not be
felt: he has but one misfortune in
the world, continued he, “He is
always in love.” —I am heartily
glad of it, said I,—'twill save me the
trouble every night of putting my
breeches under my head. In saying
this, I was making not so much La
Fleur's eloge, as my own, having
been in love with one princess or
another almost all my life, and I 

hope I shall go on so, till I die,
being firmly persuaded, that if ever
I do a mean action, it must be in
some interval betwixt one passion
and another: whilst this interregnum
lasts, I always perceive my heart
locked up —I can scarce find in it,
to give Misery a sixpence; and therefore
I always get out of it as fast as
I can, and the moment I am rekindled,
I am all generosity and
good will again; and would do any
thing in the world either for, or
with any one, if they will but satisfy
me there is no sin in it. 
—But in saying this—surely I am
commending the passion—not myself.
