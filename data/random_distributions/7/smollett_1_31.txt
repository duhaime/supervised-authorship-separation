The singular manner of Fathom's attack and
triumph over the virtue of the fair Elenor. 
Proper cognizance being thus taken of these
contraband effects, and the informer furnished
with a certificate, by which he was intitled
to a share of the seizure, the coachman
summoned his passengers to the carriage:
the purse and jewels were restored to count
Fathom, who thanked the justice, and his lordship
in particular, for the candour and hospitality
with which he had been treated, and resumed
his place in the vehicle, amidst the congratulations
of all his fellow travellers, except
the two forlorn smugglers, who instead of reimbarking
in the coach, thought proper to remain
at the inn, with a view to mitigate, if
possible, the severity of their misfortune. 
Among those who felicitated Fathom upon
the issue of this adventure, the young maiden
seemed to express the most sensible pleasure at
that event. The artful language of his eyes
had raised in her breast certain flattering emotions,
before she knew the value of her conquest; 
but now that his rank and condition
were discovered, these transports were increased
by the ideas of vanity and ambition which
are mingled with the first seeds of every female
constitution. The belief of having captivated
the heart of a man who could raise her to the
rank and dignity of a countess, produced such
agreeable sensations in her fancy, that her eyes
shone with unusual lustre, and a continual 

smile played in dimples, on her rosy cheeks; 
so that her attractions, though not powerful
enough to engage the affection, were yet sufficient
to inflame the desire of our adventurer,
who very honestly marked her chastity for
prey to his voluptuous passion. Had she
been well seasoned with knowledge and experience,
and compleatly armed with caution against
the artifice and villainy of man, her
virtue might not have been able to withstand
the engines of such an assailant, considering
the dangerous opportunities to which she was
necessarily exposed: how easy then must his
victory have been over an innocent, unsuspecting
country damsel, flushed with the
warmth of youth, and an utter stranger to
the ways of life. 
While Obadiah, therefore, and his plump
companion were engaged in conversation, on
the strange incidents which had passed, Fathom
acted a very expressive pantomime with
this fair buxom nymph, who comprehended
his meanig with surprizing facility, and was at
so little pains to conceal the pleasure she took
in this kind of intercourse, that several warm
squeezes were interchanged between her and
her lover, before they arrived at Rochester,
where they proposed to dine. It was during
this period, he learned from the answers she
made to the inquisitive quaker, that her sole
dependance was upon a relation, to whom she
had a letter, and that she was a perfect stranger
in the great city; circumstances on which
he soon formed the project of her ruin. 
Upon their arrival at the Black Bull, he for
the first time found himself alone with his Amanda, 

whose name was Elenor, their fellow-travellers
being elsewhere employed about their
own concerns; and unwilling to lose the precious
opportunity, he began to act the part of
a very importunate lover, which he conceived
to be a proper sequel to the prelude, which
had been performed in the coach. The freedoms
that she, out of pure simplicity and good
humour, permitted him to take with her hand,
and even her rosy lips, encouraged him to practise
other familiarities upon her fair bosom,
which scandalized her virtue so much, that in
spite of the passion she had begun to indulge
in his behalf, she rejected his advances with all
the marks of anger and disdain; and he found
it necessary to appease the storm he had raised,
by the most respectful and submissive demeanour; 
resolving to change his operations, and
carry on his attacks, so as to make her yield at
discretion, without alarming her religion or
pride. Accordingly, when the bill was called
after dinner, he took particular notice of her
behaviour, and peceiving her pull out a large
leathern purse that contained her money, reconnoitred
the pocket in which it was deposited,
and while they sat close to each other in the
carriage, conveyed it with admirable dexterity
into an hole in the cushion. Whether the corpulent
couple, who sat opposite to these lovers; 
had entered into an amorous engagement at
the inn, or were severally induced by other
motives, is uncertain; but, sure it is, both left
the coach on that part of the road which lies
nearest to Gravesend, and bad adieu to the
other pair, on pretence of having urgent business
at that place. 

Ferdinand, not a little pleased at their departure,
renewed his most pathetic expressions
of love, and sung several French songs on that
tender subject, which seemed to thrill to the
soul of his beauteous Helen. While the driver
halted at Dartford to water his horses, she was
smit with the appearance of some cheesecakes,
which were presented by the landlady of the
house, and having bargained for two or three,
put her hand in her pocket, in order to pay
for her purchase; but what was her astonishment,
when after having rummaged her equipage,
she understood her whole fortune was
lost! This mishap was by a loud shriek announced
to our hero, who affected infinite amazement
and concern; and no sooner learned
the cause of her affliction, than he presented
her with his own purse, from which he, in
emphatic dumb shew, begged she would indemnify
herself for the damage she had sustained. 
Although this kind proffer was some alleviation
of her misfortune, she did not fail to pour
forth a most piteous lamentation, importing
that she had not only lost all her money, amounting
to five pounds, but also her letter of
recommendation upon which she had altogether
relied for present employment. 
The vehicle was minutely searched from top
to bottom, by herself and our adventurer, assisted
by Maurice, and the coachman, who
finding their inquiry ineffectual, did not scruple
to declare his suspicion of the two fat turtles
who had deserted the coach in such an abrupt
manner. In a word, he rendered this conjecture
so plausible, by wresting the circumstances
of their behaviour and retreat, that poor Elenor 

implicitly believed they were the thieves
by whom she had suffered; and was prevailed
upon to accept the proffered assistance of the
generous count, who seeing her very much disordered
by this mischance, insisted upon her
drinking a large glass of Canary to quiet the
perturbation of her spirits. This is a season,
which of all others, is most propitious to the
attempts of an artful lover; and justifies the
metaphorical maxim of fishing in troubled waters. 
There is an affinity and short transition
betwixt all the violent passions that agitate
the human mind: they are all false perspectives,
which though they magnify, yet perplex and
render indistinct every object which they represent:
and flattery is never so successfully administred,
as to those who know they stand in
need of friendship, assent, and approbation. 
The cordial she swallowed, far from calming,
increased the disturbance of her thoughts, and
produced an intoxication; during which, she
talked in an incoherent strain, laughed and
wept by turns, and acted other extravagancies,
which are known to be symptoms of the hysterical
affection. Fathom, though an utter
stranger to the sentiments of honour, pity
and remorse, would not perpetrate his vitious
purpose, though favoured by the delirium his
villainy had intailed upon this unfortunate
young maiden; because his appetite demanded
a more perfect sacrifice, than that which she
could yield in her present deplorable situation,
when her will must have been altogether unconcerned
in his success. Determined therefore,
to make a conquest of her virtue, before
he would take possession of her person, he 

mimicked that compassion and benevolence,
which his heart had never felt, and when the
coach arrived at London, not only discharged
what she owed for her place, but likewise procured
for her an apartment in the house, to
which he himself had been directed for lodgings,
and even hired a nurse to attend her
during a severe fever, which was the consequence
of her disappointment and despondence. 
Indeed she was supplied with all necessaries by
the generosity of this noble count, who for
the interest of his passion, and the honour of
his name, was resolved to extend his charity
to the last farthing of her own money, which
he had been wise enough to secure for this
purpose. 
Her youth soon got the better of her distemper,
and when she understood her obligations
to the count, who did not fail to attend
her in person with great tenderness, her heart,
which had been before prepossessed in his favour,
now glowed with all the warmth of gratitude,
esteem and affection. She knew herself in a
strange place, destitute of all resource but in his
generosity: she loved his person, she was dazled
by his rank; and he knew so well how to
improve the opportunities and advantages he
derived from her unhappy situation, that he
gradually proceeded in sapping from one degree
of intimacy to another, until all the bulwarks
of her chastity were undermined, and
she submitted to his desire; not with the reluctance
of a vanquished people, but with all
the transports of a joyful city, that opens its
gates to receive a darling prince, returned from
conquest; for, by this time, he had artfully 

concentred and kindled up, all the inflammable
ingredients of her constitution; and she now
looked back upon the virtuous principles of
her education, as upon a disagreeable and tedious
dream, from which she had waked to
the fruition of never-fading joy.
