—They order, said I, this
matter better in France— 
—You have been in France? said
my gentleman, turning quick upon
me with the most civil triumph in
the world. —Strange! quoth I, debating
the matter with myself, That
one and twenty miles sailing, for 'tis
absolutely no further from Dover to
Calais, should give a man these 

rights —I'll look into them: so giving
up the argument —I went straight
to my lodgings, put up half a dozen
shirts and a black pair of silk breeches
—“the coat I have on, said I, looking
at the sleeve, will do”—took a
place in the Dover stage; and the
packet sailing at nine the next morning
—by three I had got sat down to
my dinner upon a fricassee'd chicken
so incontestably in France, that had
I died that night of an indigestion,
the whole world could not have suspended
the effects of the *  Droits 

d'aubaine—my shirts, and black pair
of silk breeches—portmanteau and
all must have gone to the King of
France—even the little picture which
I have so long worn, and so often
have told thee, Eliza, I would carry
with me into my grave, would have
been torn from my neck. —Ungenerous!
—to seize upon the wreck of an
unwary passenger, whom your subjects
had beckon'd to their coast—by
heaven! Sire, it is not well done; 
and much does it grieve me, 'tis the
monarch of a people so civilized and
courteous, and so renown'd for sentiment
and fine feelings, that I have
to reason with— 
But I have scarce set foot in your
dominions—
