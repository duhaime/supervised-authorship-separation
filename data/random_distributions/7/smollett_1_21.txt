He prepares a stratagem, but finds himself countermined; 
proceeds on his journey, and is
overtaken by a terrible tempest. 
In the course of this journey, Ferdinand,
who was never deficient in his political capacity,
held a secret conclave with his own
thoughts, not only touching the plan of his
own future conduct, but also concerning his
associate, of whose fidelity and adherence he
began to entertain such doubts as discouraged
him from the prosecution of that design, in
which the Tyroleze had been at first included:
for he had lately observed him practise the
arts of his occupation among the French officers,
with such rapacity and want of caution, 

as indicated a dangerous temerity of temper,
as well as a furious rage of acquiring, which
might be sometime or other satiated upon his
own friends. In other words, our adventurer
was afraid that his accomplice would profit by
his knowledge of the road and countries thro'
which they travelled, and after having made
free with his most valuable effects, in consequence
of the familiarity subsisting between
them, leave him some morning without the
ceremony of a formal adieu. 
Arroused by this suspicion, he resolved to
anticipate the supposed intention of the Tyroleze,
by taking his own departure in the
same abrupt manner; and this scheme he
actually put in execution, upon their arrival in
Bar le duc, where it was agreed they should
spend a day to repose and refresh themselves
from the fatigue of hard riding. Ferdinand,
therefore, taking the advantage of his companion's
absence, for the Tyroleze had walked
abroad to view the town, found means to
hire a peasant, who undertook to conduct him
through a bye road, as far as Chalons; and
with this guide, he accordingly set out on
horseback, after having discharged the bill,
left a blank paper sealed up in form of a letter,
directed to his friend, and secured behind
his own saddle, a pair of leathern bags in which
his jewels and cash were usually contained. 
So eager was our hero to leave the Tyroleze at
a considerable distance behind, that he rode all
night at a round pace, without halting, and
next morning, found himself at a village distant
thirteen good leagues, from any part of 

the route, which he and his companion had at
first resolved to pursue. 
Here thinking himself safely delivered from
the cause of all his apprehension, he determined
to lie incognito for a few days, so as that he
might run no risque of an accidental meeting
upon the road, with the person whose company
he had forsaken; and accordingly he took
possession of an apartment, in which he went
to rest, desiring his guide to wake him, when
dinner should be ready. Having enjoyed a
very comfortable refreshment of sleep, with
his bags under his pillow, he was summoned
according to his direction, and ate a very hearty
meal with great tranquility and internal satisfaction. 
In the afternoon, he amused himself
with happy presages, and ideal prospects of his
future fortune, and in the midst of these imaginary
banquets, was seized with an inclination
of realizing his bliss, and regaling his eye-sight
with the fruits of that success, which had hitherto
attended his endeavours. Thus inflamed,
he opened the repository, and, O reader!
what were his reflections, when in lieu of
mademoiselle Melvile's ear-rings and necklace,
the German's golden chain, divers jewels of
considerable value, the spoils of sundry dupes,
and about two hundred ducats in ready money,
he found neither more nor less than a parcel
of rusty nails, disposed in such a manner as to
resemble in weight and bulk the moveables he
had lost. 
It is not to be supposed, our adventurer
made this discovery without emotion. If the
eternal salvation of mankind could have been
purchased for the tenth part of his treasure, 

he would have left the whole species in a state
of reprobation, rather than redeem them at
that price, unless he had seen in the bargain,
some evident advantage to his own concerns:
one may therefore easily conceive with what
milkiness of resignation, he bore the loss of the
whole, and saw himself reduced from such affluence,
to the necessity of depending upon
about twenty ducats, and some loose silver,
which he carried in his pocket, for his expence
upon the road. However bitter this pill might
be in swallowing, he so far mastered his mortification,
as to digest it with a good grace:
his own penetration at once pointed out the
canal through which this misfortune had flowed
upon him; he forthwith placed the calamity
to the account of the Tyroleze, and never
doubting that he had retired with the booty
across the Rhine, into some place to which he
knew Fathom would not follow his footsteps,
he formed the melancholy resolution of pursuing
with all dispatch his journey to Paris,
that he might with all convenient expedition,
indemnify himself for the discomfiture he had
sustained. 
With regard to his confederate, his conjecture
was perfectly right; that adventurer,
though infinitely inferior to our hero in point
of genius and invention, had manifestly the advantage
of him, in the articles of age and experience; 
he was no stranger to Fathom's qualifications,
the happy exertion of which he had
often seen. He knew him to be an œconomist
of the most frugal order, consequently concluded
his finances were worthy of examination; 
and upon the true principles of a sharper, 

eased him of the incumbrance, taking it
for granted, that, in so doing, he only precluded
Ferdinand from the power of acting
the same tragedy upon him, should ever opportunity
concur with his inclination. He had
therefore concerted his measures with the dexterity
of an experienced conveyancer, and
snatching the occasion, while our hero, travel-tainted,
lay sunk in the arms of profound repose,
he ript up the seams of the leathern depository,
withdrew the contents, introduced
the parcel of nails, which he had made up for
the purpose, and then repaired the breach with
great deliberation. 
Had Fathom's good genius prompted him
to examine his effects next morning, the Tyroleze,
in all probability, would have maintained
his acquisition by force of arms; for
his personal courage was rather more determined
than that of our adventurer, and he
was conscious of his own ascendancy in this
particular; but his good fortune prevented
such explanation. Immediately after dinner,
he availed himself of his knowledge, and betaking
himself to a remote part of the town,
set out in a post-chaise for Luneville, while our
hero was meditating his own escape. 
Fathom's conception was sufficient to comprehend
the whole of this adventure, as soon
as his chagrin would give his sagacity fair play; 
nor would he allow his resolution to sink under
the trial; on the contrary, he departed
from the village, that same afternoon, under
the auspices of his conductor, and found himself
benighted in the midst of a forest far from
the habitations of men; the darkness of the 

night, the silence and solitude of the place, the
indistinct images of the trees that appeared on
every side, “stretching their extravagant arms
athwart the gloom,” conspired with the dejection
of spirits occasioned by his loss to disturb
his fancy, and raise strange phantoms in
his imagination. Although he was not naturally
superstitious, his mind began to be invaded
with an awful horror, that gradually prevailed
over all the consolations of reason and
philosophy; nor was his heart free from the
terrors of assassination. In order to dissipate
these disagreeable reveries, he had recourse to
the conversation of his guide, by whom he
was entertained with the history of divers travellers,
who had been robbed and murdered
by ruffians, whose retreat was in the recesses of
that very wood. 
In the midst of this communication, which
did not at all tend to the elevation of our hero's
spirits, the conductor made an excuse for
dropping behind, while our traveller jogged on
in expectation of being joined again by him in
a few minutes: he was however disappointed
in that hope: the sound of the other horse's
feet, by degrees, grew more and more faint,
and at last altogether died away. Alarmed at
this circumstance, Fathom halted in the middle
of the road, and listened with the most fearful
attention; but his sense of hearing was saluted
with nought but the dismal sighings of the
trees, that seemed to foretell an approaching
storm; accordingly the Heavens contracted a
more dreary aspect, the lightning began to
gleam, the thunder to roll, and the tempest 

raising its voice to a tremenduous roar, descended
in a torrent of rain. 
In this emergency, the fortitude of our hero
was almost quite overcome; so many concurring
circumstances of danger and distress might
have appalled the most undaunted breast; what
impression then must they have made upon the
mind of Ferdinand, who was by no means a
man to set fear at defiance! indeed, he had well
nigh lost the use of his reflection, and was actually
invaded to the skin, before he could recollect
himself so far as to quit the road, and seek
for shelter among the thickets that surrounded
them. Having rode some furlongs into the
forest, he took his station under a tuft of tall
trees, that screened him from the storm, and in
that situation called a council within himself,
to deliberate upon his next excursion. He persuaded
himself, that his guide had deserted him
for the present, in order to give intelligence of
a traveller, to some gang of robbers with whom
he was connected; and that he must of necessity
fall a prey to those banditti, unless he should
have the good fortune to elude their search,
and disentangle himself from the mazes of the
wood. 
Harrowed with these apprehensions, he resolved
to commit himself to the mercy of the
hurricane, as of two evils the least, and penetrate
streight forwards through some devious
opening, until he should be delivered from the
forest. For this purpose, he turned his horse's
head in a line, quite contrary to the direction
of the high road which he had left, on the supposition,
that the robbers would pursue that
tract in quest of him, and that they would never 

dream of his deserting the highway, to
traverse an unknown forest, amidst the darkness
of such a boisterous night. After he had
continued in this progress, through a succession
of groves, and bogs, and thorns, and brakes, by
which, not only his cloaths, but also his skin
suffered in a grievous manner, while every
nerve quivered with eagerness of dismay; he
at length reached an open plain, and pursuing
his course, in full hope of arriving at some
village, where his life would be safe, he descried
a rush light at a distance, which he looked upon
as the star of his good fortune, and riding towards
it at full speed, arrived at the door of a
lone cottage, into which he was admitted by an
old woman, who understanding he was a bewildered
traveller, received him with great hospitality. 
When he learned from his hostess, that there
was not another house within three leagues,
that she could accommodate him with a tolerable
bed, and his horse with lodging and oats,
he thanked Heaven for his good fortune in
stumbling upon this homely habitation, and determined
to pass the night under the protection
of the old cottager, who gave him to understand,
that her husband, who was a faggot-maker,
had gone to the next town to dispose of
his merchandize, and that, in all probability, he
would not return till next morning, on account
of the tempestuous night. Ferdinand
sounded the bel-dame with a thousand artful
interrogations, and she answered with such appearance
of truth and simplicity, that he concluded
his person was quite secure; and after
having been regaled with a dish of eggs and bacon, 

desired she would conduct him into the
chamber where she proposed he should take
his repose. He was accordingly ushered up by
a sort of ladder, into an apartment furnished
with a standing-bed, and almost half filled with
trusses of straw. He seemed extremely well
pleased with his lodging, which in reality exceeded
his expectation, and his kind landlady
cautioning him against letting the candle approach
the combustibles, took her leave, and
locked the door on the outside.
