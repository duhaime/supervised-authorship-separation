Mr. Williams has been here both these Days, as
usual; but is very indifferently received still
by Mrs. Jewkes; and, to avoid Suspicion, I left
them together, and went up to my Closet, most of
the Time he was here. He and she, I found by
her, had a Quarrel; and she seems quite out of Humour
with him; but I thought it best not to say
any thing. And he said, he would very little trouble
the House, till he had an Answer to his Letter from
the 'Squire. And she return'd, The less, the better. 
Poor Man! he has got but little by his Openness,
and making Mrs. Jewkes his Confident, as she bragged,
and would have had me to do likewise. I
am more and more satisfied there is Mischief brewing,
and shall begin to hide my Papers, and be circumspect. 
She seems mighty impatient for an Answer
to her Letter to my Master.
