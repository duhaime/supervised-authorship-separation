SIR,
Never poor Wight of a Dedicator
had less hopes from
his Dedication, than I have from
this of mine; for it is written in
a bye corner of the kingdom, and
in a retired thatch'd house, where
I live in a constant endeavour to
fence against the infirmities of ill
health, and other evils of life, by 

mirth; being firmly persuaded that
every time a man smiles,—but
much more so, when he laughs,
that it adds something to this Fragment
of Life. 
I humbly beg, Sir, that you
will honour this book by taking
it—(not under your Protection,
—it must protect itself, but)— 
into the country with you; where,
if I am ever told, it has made
you smile, or can conceive it has
beguiled you of one moment's
pain—I shall think myself as
happy as a minister of state;— 
perhaps much happier than any 

one (one only excepted) that I have
ever read or heard of. 
I am, great Sir,
(and what is more to your Honour,)
I am, good Sir,
Your Well-wisher,
and most humble Fellow-Subject, 
The Author.
