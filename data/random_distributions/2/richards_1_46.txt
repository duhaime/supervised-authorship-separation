Miss Clarissa Harlowe, To Miss Howe. 

Wednesday Morning, 9 o' clock. 
My Aunt Hervey lay here last night, and is but
just gone from me. She came up to me with
my Sister. They would not trust my Aunt without
this ill-natured witness. When she entered my chamber,
I told her, That this visit was a high favour to
a poor prisoner, in her hard confinement. I kissed her
hand. She, kindly saluting me, said, Why this distance
to your Aunt, my dear, who loves you so well? 

She owned, That she came to expostulate with me,
for the peace-sake of the family: For that she could
not believe it possible, if I did not conceive myself unkindly
treated, that I, who had ever shewn such a
sweetness of temper, as well as manners, should be
thus resolute, in a point so very near to my Father,
and all my friends. My Mother and she were both
willing to impute my resolution to the manner I had
been begun with; and to my supposing, that my Brother
had originally more of a hand in the proposals
made by Mr. Solmes, than my Father or other friends. 
In short, fain would my Aunt have furnished me with
an excuse to come off my opposition; Bella all the
while humming a tune, and opening this book and
that, without meaning; but saying nothing. 
After having shewed me, that my opposition could
not be of signification, my Father's honour being engaged,
my Aunt concluded with enforcing upon me
my duty, in stronger terms than I believe she would
have done (the circumstances of the case considered)
had not my Sister been present. 
It would but be repeating what I have so often mentioned,
to give you the arguments that passed on both
sides. —So I will only recite what she was pleased to
say, that carried with it a new face. 
When she found me inflexible, as she was pleased
to call it, she said, For her part, she could not but
say, that if I were not to have either Mr. Solmes or
Mr. Lovelace, and yet, to make my friends easy, must
marry, she should not think amiss of Mr. Wyerley. 
What did I think of Mr. Wyerley? 
Ay, Clary, put in my Sister, what say you to Mr.
Wyerley? 
I saw thro' this immediately. It was said on purpose,
I doubted not, to have an argument against me
of absolute prepossession in Mr. Lovelace's favour: 
Since Mr. Wyerley every-where avows his value,
even to veneration, for me; and is far less exceptionable, 

both in person and mind, than Mr. Solmes: And I
was willing to turn the tables, by trying how far Mr.
Solmes's terms might be dispensed with; since the
same terms could not be expected from Mr. Wyerley. 
I therefore desired to know, Whether my answer,
if it should be in favour of Mr. Wyerley, would release
me from Mr. Solmes? —For I owned, that I had not
the aversion to him, that I had to the other. 
Nay, she had no commission to propose such a thing. 
She only knew, that my Father and Mother would
not be easy till Mr. Lovelace's hopes were entirely
defeated. 
Cunning creature! said my Sister. 
And this, and her joining in the question before,
convinced me, that it was a designed snare for me. 
Don't You, dear Madam, said I, put questions
that can answer no end, but to support my Brother's
schemes against me. —But are there any hopes of an
end to my sufferings and disgrace, without having this
hated man imposed upon me? Will not what I have
offered be accepted? I am sure it ought—I will venture
to say That. 
Why, Niece, if there be not any such hopes, I presume
you don't think yourself absolved from the duty
due from a child to her parents? 
Yes, said my Sister, I do not doubt but it is Miss
Clary's aim, if she does not fly to her Lovelace, to
get her Estate into her own hands, and go to live at
The Grove, in that independence upon which she
builds all her perverseness. And, dear heart! my little
Love, how will you then blaze away! Your mamma
Norton, your oracle, with your Poor at your gates,
mingling so proudly and so meanly with the ragged
herd! Reflecting, by your ostentation, upon all the Ladies
in the county, who do not as you do. This is
known to be your scheme! And the Poor without-doors,
and Lovelace within, with one hand building
up a name, pulling it down with the other! —O 

what a charming scheme is this! —But let me tell you,
my pretty little flighty one, that your Father's living
Will shall controul your Grandfather's dead one; and
That Estate will be disposed of as your fond Grandfather
would have disposed of it, had he lived to see
such a change in his favourite. In a word, Miss, it will
be kept out of your hands, till my Father sees you discreet
enough to have the management of it, or till you
can dutifully, by Law, tear it from him. 
Fie, Miss Harlowe! said my Aunt: This is not pretty
to your Sister. 
O Madam, let her go on. This is nothing to
what I have borne from Miss Harlowe. She is either
commissioned to treat me ill by her Envy, or by an
higher authority, to which I must submit. —As to revoking
the Estate, what hinders, if I pleased? I know
my power; but have not the least thought of exerting
it. Be pleased to let my Father know, that, whatever
be the consequence to myself, were he to turn
me out of doors (which I should rather he would do,
than to be confined and insulted as I am) and were I
to be reduced to indigence and want, I would seek no
relief that should be contrary to his will. 
For that matter, child, said my Aunt, were you to
marry, you must do as your Husband will have you. 
If that Husband be Mr. Lovelace, he will be glad of
any opportunity of further embroiling the families. 
And, let me tell you, Niece, if he had the respect for
you which he pretends to have, he would not throw
out defiances as he does. He is known to be a very
revengeful man; and were I you, Miss Clary, I should
be afraid he would wreak upon me that vengeance,
though I had not offended him, which he is continually
threatening to pour upon the family. 
Mr. Lovelace's threatened vengeance is in return for
threatened vengeance. It is not every-body will bear
insult, as, of late, I have been forced to bear it. 
O how my Sister's face shone with passion! 

But Mr. Lovelace, proceeded I, as I have said
twenty and twenty times, would be quite out of the
question with me, were I to be generously treated! 
My Sister said something with great vehemence: 
But only raising my voice, to be heard, without minding
her, Pray, Madam (provokingly interrogated I)
was he not known to have been as wild a man, when
he was at first introduced into our family, as he now
is said to be? Yet then, the common phrases of wild
oats, and black oxen, and such-like, were qualifiers; 
and Marriage, and the Wife's discretion, were to perform
wonders—But (turning to my Sister) I find I
have said too much. 
O thou wicked reflecter! —And what made me abhor
him, think you, but the proof of those villainous
freedoms that ought to have had the same effect upon
you, were you but half so good a creature as you
pretend to be? 
Proof, did you say, Bella! I thought you had not
proof? —But you know best. 
Was not this very spiteful, my dear? 
Now, Clary, said she, would I give a thousand
pounds to know all that is in thy little rancorous and
reflecting heart, at this moment. 
I might let you know for a much less sum, and not
be afraid of being worse treated than I have been. 
Well, young Ladies, I am sorry to see passion run
so high between you. You know, Niece (to me) you
had not been confined thus to your apartment, could
your Mother by condescension, or your Father by authority,
have been able to move you. But how
can you expect, when there must be a concession on
one side, that it should be on theirs? If my Dolly,
who has not the hundredth part of your understanding,
were thus to set herself up in absolute contradiction
to my will, in a point so material, I should not
take it well of her—Indeed I should not. 
I believe not, Madam: And if Miss Hervey had just 

such a Brother, and just such a Sister [You may look,
Bella!] and if both were to aggravate her Parents,
as my Brother and Sister do mine—Then, perhaps,
you might use her as I am used: And if she hated the
man you proposed to her, and with as much reason
as I do Mr. Solmes— 
And loved a Rake and Libertine, Miss, as you do
Lovelace, said my Sister— 
Then might she [continued I, not minding her]
beg to be excused from obeying. But yet if she did,
and would give you the most solemn assurances, and
security besides, that she never would have the man
you disliked, against your consent—I dare say, Miss
Hervey's Father and Mother would sit down satisfied,
and not endeavour to force her inclinations. 
So!—[said my Sister, with uplifted hands] Father
and Mother now come in for their share! 
But if, child, replied my Aunt, I knew she loved
a Rake, and suspected that she sought only to gain
time, in order to wire-draw me into a consent— 
I beg pardon, Madam, for interrupting you; but
if Miss Hervey could obtain your consent, what further
would be to be said? 
True, child; but she never should. 
Then, Madam, it never would be. 
That I doubt, Niece. 
If you do, Madam, can you think confinement and
ill usage is the way to prevent the apprehended rashness? 
My dear, this sort of intimation would make one
but too apprehensive, that there is no trusting to yourself,
when one knows your inclination. 
That apprehension, Madam, seems to have been
conceived before this intimation, or the least cause for
it, was given. Why else the disgraceful confinement
I have been laid under? —Let me venture to say, that
my sufferings seem to be rather owing to a concerted
design to intimidate me [Bella held up her Hands], 

(knowing there were too good grounds for my opposition)
than to a doubt of my conduct; for, when
they were inflicted first, I had given no cause of
doubt: Nor should there now be room for any, if
my discretion might be trusted to. 
My Aunt, after a little hesitation, said, But, consider,
my dear, what confusion will be perpetuated in
your family, if you marry this hated Lovelace? 
And let it be considered, what misery to me, Madam,
if I marry that hated Solmes? 
Many a young creature has thought she could not
love a man, with whom she has afterwards been very
happy. Few women, child, marry their first Loves. 
That may be the reason there are so few happy
Marriages. 
But there are few first impressions fit to be encouraged. 
I am afraid so too, Madam. I have a very indifferent
opinion of light and first impressions. But, as I
have often said, all I wish for, is, to have leave to live
single. 
Indeed you must not, Miss. Your Father and Mother
will be unhappy till they see you married, and out
of Lovelace's reach. —I am told, that you propose to
condition with him (so far are matters gone between
you) never to have any man, if you have not him. 
I know no better way to prevent mischief on all
sides, I freely own it—And there is not, if he be out
of the question, another man in the world, I can think
favourably of. —Nevertheless, I would give all I have
in the world, that he were married to some other person
—Indeed I would, Bella, for all you put on that
smile of incredulity. 
May be so, Clary: But I will smile for all that. 
If he be out of the question! repeated my Aunt— 
So, Miss Clary, I see how it is—I will go down— 
[Miss Harlowe, shall I follow you?—] And I will
endeavour to persuade your Father to let my Sister 

herself come up: And a happier event may then result. 
Depend upon it, Madam, said my Sister, This will
be the case: My Mother and she will be both in tears; 
but with this different effect: My Mother will come
down softened, and cut to the heart; but will leave her
favourite hardened, from the advantages she will think
she has over my Mother's tenderness—Why, Madam,
it is for this very reason the girl is not admitted into
her presence. 
Thus she ran on, as she went down-stairs.
