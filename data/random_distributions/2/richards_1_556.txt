 &dotup;If, 'mid their round of pleasure, to convey
&dotup;An useful Lesson to the Young and Gay;
&dotup;To swell their eyes with pearly drops, and share,
&dotup;With Cards and Dress, the converse of the Fair;
&dotup;Th' attention of the Learned to engage,
&dotup;And in the bosom of the Rake to raise
&dotup;A tender, social Feeling—merit praise;
&dotup;The Gay, the Fair, the Learn'd, ev'n Rakes, agree
&dotup;To give that praise to Nature, Truth, and Thee.
 &dotup;Transported now to Harlowe-Place, we view
&dotup;Thy matchless Maid her godlike tasks pursue;
&dotup;Visit the Sick or Needy, and bestow
&dotup;Drugs to relieve, or words to soften woe;
&dotup;Or, with the pious Lewen, hear her soar
&dotup;Heights unattain'd by female minds before.
&dotup;Then to her Ivy-Bow'r she pleas'd retires,
&dotup;And with light touch the trembling keys inspires;
&dotup;While wakeful Philomel no more complains,
&dotup;But, raptur'd, listens to her sweeter strains.
 &dotup;Now (direful contrast!) in each gloomy shade
&dotup;Behold a pitying Swain, or weeping Maid!
&dotup;And, hark! with sullen swing, the tolling bell
&dotup;Proclaims or that loss which language fails to tell.

&dotup;In awful silence soon a sight appears,
&dotup;That points their sorrows, and renews their tears:
&dotup;For, lo! far-black'ning all the verdant meads,
&dotup;With slow parade, the fun'ral pomp proceeds:
&dotup;Methinks ev'n now I hear th' encumber'd ground,
&dotup;And pavement, echo with a rumbling sound;
&dotup;And see the servants tearful eyes declare
&dotup;With speaking look, The herse, the herse, is here!
 &dotup;But, O thou Sister of Clarissa's heart,
&dotup;Can I the anguish of thy soul impart,
&dotup;When, from your chariot flown with breathless haste,
&dotup;Her clay-cold form, yet beauteous, you embrac'd;
&dotup;And cry'd with heaving sobs, and broken strains,
&dotup;Are these—are these—my much-lov'd Friend's Remains?
&dotup;Then view each Harlowe-Face; remorse, despair,
&dotup;And self-condemning grief, are pictur'd there.
&dotup;Now first the Brother feels, with guilty sighs,
&dotup;Fraternal passions in his bosom rise:
&dotup;By shame and sorrow equally opprest,
&dotup;The Sister wrings her hands, and beats her breast.
&dotup;With streaming eyes, too late, the Mother blames
&dotup;Her tame submission to the tyrant James:
&dotup;Ev'n he, the gloomy Father, o'er the herse
&dotup;Laments his Rashness, and recalls his Curse.
&dotup;And thus each Parents, who, with haughty sway,
&dotup;Expects his child to tremble and obey;
&dotup;Who hopes his pow'r by rigour to maintain,
&dotup;And meanly worships at the shrine of gain;
&dotup;Shall mourn his error, and, repenting, own,
&dotup;That Bliss can ne'er depend on wealth alone.
&dotup;Riches may charm, and Pageantry invite:
&dotup;But what are these, unless the minds unite?
&dotup;Drive then insatiate Av'rice from your breast,
&dotup;Nor think a Solmes can make Clarissa blest.
 &dotup;And you, ye Fair, the wish of ev'ry heart,
&dotup;Tho' grac'd by Nature, and adorn'd by Art,

&dotup;Tho' sprightly Youth its vernal bloom bestow,
&dotup;And on your cheeks the blush of Beauty glow,
&dotup;Here see how soon those roses of a day,
&dotup;Nipt by a frost, fade, wither, and decay!
&dotup;Nor Youth nor Beauty could Clarissa save,
&dotup;Snatch'd to an early, not untimely grave.
&dotup;But still her own unshaken Innocence,
&dotup;Spotless and pure, unconscious of offence,
&dotup;In the dread hour of death her bosom warm'd
&dotup;With more than manly courage, and disarm'd
&dotup;The griesly king: In vain the tyrant try'd
&dotup;His awful terrors—for she smil'd, and dy'd.
 &dotup;You too, ye Libertines, who idly jest
&dotup;With Virtue wrong'd, and Innocence distrest;
&dotup;Who vainly boast of what should be your shame,
&dotup;And triumph in the wreck of female fame;
&dotup;Be warn'd, like Belford, and behold, with dread,
&dotup;The Hand of Vengeance hov'ring o'er your head!
&dotup;If not, in Belton's Agonies you view
&dotup;What dying horrors are reserv'd for you.
 &dotup;In vain ev'n Lovelace, healthy, young, and gay,
&dotup;By Nature form'd to please, and to betray,
&dotup;Try'd from himself, by change of place, to run;
&dotup;For that intruder, Thought, he could not shun.
&dotup;Tasteless were all the pleasures that he view'd
&dotup;In foreign courts; for Conscience still pursu'd:
&dotup;The lost Clarissa, each succeeding night,
&dotup;In starry garment, swims before his sight;
&dotup;Nor ease by day her shrill complaints afford,
&dotup;But far more deeply wound than Morden's sword.
 &dotup;O if a Sage had thus on Attic plains
&dotup;Improv'd at once and charm'd the list'ning swains;
&dotup;Had he, with matchless energy of thought,
&dotup;Great Truths like these in antient Athens taught;
&dotup;On fam'd Ilyssus' banks in Parian stone
&dotup;His breathing Bust conspicuous would have shone;

&dotup;Ev'n Plato, in Lyceum's awful shade,
&dotup;Th' instructive page with transport had survey'd;
&dotup;And own'd its author to have well supply'd
&dotup;The place his Laws to Homer's self deny'd (a) .&dotup;
