They proceed to the Hague; from whence they depart
for Amsterdam, where they see a Dutch
tragedy. Visit a musick-house, in which Peregrine
quarrels with the caption of a man of war. 
They pass through Haarlem, in their way to
Leyden. Return to Rotterdam, where the
company separates, and our hero, with his attendants,
arrives in safety at Harwich. 
Being joined by their fellow-travellers, in the
morning, they made a tour to all the remarkable
places in this celebrated village; saw
the Foundery, the Stadthouse, the Spinhuys,
Vauxhall, and Count Bentinck's gardens, and in
the evening went to the French comedy, which
was directed by a noted Harlequin, who had
found means to flatter the Dutch taste so effectually,
that they extolled him as the greatest actor
that ever appeared in the province of Holland. 
This famous company did not represent regular
theatrical pieces, but only a sort of impromptu's,
in which this noted player always performed the
greatest part of the entertainment. Among other
sallies of wit that escaped him, there was one circumstance
so remarkably adapted to the disposition
and genius of his audience, that it were pity to
pass it over in silence: A windmill being exhibited
on the scene, Harlequin, after having surveyed
it with curiosity and admiration, asks of
one of the millers, the use of that machine; and
being told, that it was a windmill, observes with
some concern, that as there was not the least
breath of wind, he could not have the pleasure of 

seeing it turn around. Urged by this consideration,
he puts himself into the attitude of a person
wrapt in profound meditation; and having
continued a few seconds in this posture, runs to
the miller with great eagerness and joy, and telling
him, that he had found an expedient to make
his mill work, very fairly unbuttons his breeches,
and presenting his posteriors to the sails of the machine,
certain explosions are immediately heard,
and the arms of the mill begin to turn around, to
the infinite satisfaction of the spectators, who approve
the joke with loud peals of applause. 
Our travellers stayed a few days at the Hague,
during which the young gentleman waited on the
British embassador, to whom he was recommended
by his Excellency at Paris, and lost about
thirty guineas at billiards to a French adventurer,
who decoyed him into the snare by keeping up
his game; then they departed in a post-waggon
for Amsterdam, being provided with letters of introduction
to an English merchant residing in
that city, under whose auspices they visited every
thing worth seeing, and among other excursions
went to see a Dutch tragedy acted; an entertainment
which, of all others, had the strangest
effect upon the organs of our hero: the dress of
their chief personages was so antick, their manner
so aukwardly absurd, and their language so
ridiculously unfit for conveying the sentiments of
love and honour, that Peregrine's nerves were
diuretically affected with the complicated absurdity,
and he was compelled to withdraw twenty
times before the catastrophe of the piece. 
The subject of this performance was the famous
story of Scipio's continence and virtue, in restoring 

the fair captive to her lover. The young
Roman hero was represented by a broad-fac'd Batavian,
in a burgo-master's gown and a fur-cap,
sitting smoaking his pipe at a table furnished with
a can of beer, a drinking-glass, and a plate of
tobacco: the lady was such a person as Scipio
might very well be supported to give away, with-out
any great effort of generosity; and indeed the
Celtiberian prince seemed to be of that opinion; 
for, upon receiving her from the hand of the
victor, he discovered none of those transports of
gratitude and joy which Livy describes, in recounting
this event. The Dutch Scipio, however,
was complaisant enough in his way; for he
desired her to sit at his right hand, by the appellation
of Ya frow, and with his own fingers filling
a clean pipe, presented it to Mynheer Allucio the
lover. The rest of the œconomy of the piece
was in the same taste; which was so agreeable to
the audience, that they seemed to have shaken
off their natural phlegm, in order to applaud the
performance. 
From the play our company adjourned to the
house of their friend, where they spent the evening; 
and the conversation turning upon poetry,
a Dutchman who was present, and understood
the English language, having listened very attentively
to the discourse, lifted up with both hands
the greatest part of a Cheshire cheese that lay upon
the table, saying, “I do know vat is boetrie. 
Mine brotre be a great boet, and ave vrought a
book as dick as all dat.” Pickle, diverted with
this method of estimating an author according to
the quantity of his works, inquired about the
subjects of this bard's writing; but of these his
brother could give no account, or other information, 

but that there was little market for the
commodity, which hung heavy upon his hands,
and induced him to with he had applied himself
to another trade. 
The only remarkable scene in Amsterdam,
which our company had not seen, was the Spuyl
or musick-houses, which, by the connivance of
the magistrates, are maintained for the recreation
of those who might attempt the chastity of creditable
women, if they were not provided with
such conveniences. To one of these night-houses
did our travellers repair, under the conduct
of the English merchant, and were introduced
into such another place as the ever-memorable
coffee-house of Moll King; with this difference,
that the company here were not so riotous
as the Bucks of Covent-Garden, but formed
themselves into a circle, within which some of
the number danced to the musick of a scurvy organ
and a few other instruments, that uttered
tunes very suitable to the disposition of the
hearers, while the whole apartment was shrouded
with clouds of smoke impervious to the view. 
When our gentlemen entered, the floor was occupied
by two females and their gallants, who,
in the performance of their exercise, lifted their
legs like so many oxen at plough; and the pipe of
one of these hoppers happening to be exhausted
in the midst of his sarabrand, he very deliberately
drew forth his tobacco-box, filling and lighting
it again, without any interruption to the dance. 
Peregrine being unchecked by the presence of
his governor, who was too tender of his own reputation
to attend them in this expedition, made
up to a sprightly French girl that sat in seeming
expectation of a customer, and prevailing upon 

her to be his partner, led her into the circle, and,
in his turn, took the opportunity of dancing a
minuet, to the admiration of all present. He intended
to have exhibited another specimen of his
ability in this art, when a captain of a Dutchman
of war chancing to come in, and see a stranger
engaged with the lady whom, it seems, he had
bespoke for his bedfellow, he advanced, without
any ceremony, and seizing her by the arm, pull'd
her to the other side of the room. Our adventurer,
who was not a man to put up with such a
brutal affront, followed the ravisher with indignation
in his eyes; and pushing him on one side,
retook the subject of their contest, and led her
back to the place from whence she had been
dragged. The Dutchman, enraged at the
youth's presumption, obeyed the first dictates of
his choler, and lent his rival an hearty box on
the ear; which was immediately repaid with interest,
before our hero could recollect himself
sufficiently to lay his hand upon his sword, and
beckon the aggressor to the door. 
Notwithstanding the confusion and disorder
which this affair produced in the room, and the
endeavours of Pickle's company, who interposed,
in order to prevent bloodshed, the antagonists
gained the street; and Peregrine drawing, was
surprised to see the captain advance against him
with along knife, which he preferred to the
sword that hung by his side. The youth, confounded
at this preposterous behaviour, desired
him, in the French tongue, to lay aside that vulgar
implement, and approach like a gentleman:
but the Hollander, who neither understood the
proposal, nor would have complied with his demand
had he been made acquainted with his 

meaning, rushed forward like a desperado, before
his adversary could put himself on his guard; and
if the young gentleman had not been endued
with surprising agility, his nose would have fallen
a sacrifice to the fury of the assailant. Finding
himself in such imminent jeopardy, he jumped to
one side, and the Dutchman passing him, in the
force of his career, he with one nimble kick
made such application to his enemy's heels, that
he flew like lightening into the canal, where he
had almost perished, by pitching upon one of the
posts with which it was faced. 
Peregrine having performed this exploit, did
not stay for the captain's coming on shore, but
retreated with all dispatch, by the advice of his
conductor, and next day embarked, with his
companions, in the Skuyt, for Haarlem, where
they dined, and in the evening arrived at the antient
city of Leyden, where they meet with some
English students, who treated them with great
hospitality. Not but that the harmony of the
conversation was that same night interrupted by
a dispute that arose between one of those young
gentleman and the physician, about the cold and
hot methods of prescription in the gout and rheumatism; 
and proceeded to such a degree of mutual
reviling, that Pickle ashamed and incensed
at his fellow-traveller's want of urbanity, espoused
the others cause, and openly rebuked him
for his unmannerly petulance, which (he said)
rendered him unfit for the purposes, and unworthy
of the benefit of, society. This unexpected declaration
overwhelmed the doctor with amazement
and confusion; he was instantaneously deprived
of his speech, and during the remaining
part of the partie, sat in silent mortification. In 

all probability he deliberated with himself, whether
or not he should expostulate with the young
gentleman on the freedom he had taken with his
character in a company of strangers; but as he
knew that he had not a Pallet to deal with, he
very prudently suppressed that suggestion, and in
secret chewed the cud of resentment. 
After they had visited the physic garden, the
university, the anatomical hall, and every other
thing that was recommended to their view, they
returned to Rotterdam, and held a consultation
upon the method of transporting themselves to
England. The doctor, whose grudge against Peregrine
was rather inflamed than allayed by our
hero's indifference and neglect, had tampered
with the simplicity of the painter, who was proud
of his advances towards a perfect reconciliation; 
and now took the opportunity of parting with
our adventurer, by declaring that he and his friend
Mr. Pallet were resolved to take their passage in
a trading sloop, after he had heard Peregrine object
against that tedious, disagreeable, and uncertain
method of conveyance. Pickle immediately
saw his intention; and, without using the least argument
to dissuade them from their design, or
expressing the smallest degree of concern at their
separation, very coolly wished them a prosperous
voyage, and ordered his baggage to be sent to
Helvoetsluys, where he himself, and his retinue,
went on board of the pacquet next day, and, by
the favour of a fair wind, in eighteen hours arrived
at Harwich.
