Mr. Lovelace, To Miss Clarissa Harlowe. 
Superscribed, To Mrs. Lovelace. 

M. Hall, Sunday Night, June 25. 
My dearest Love,
I cannot find words to express how much I am mortified
at the return of my messenger, without a
line from you. 

Thursday is so near, that I will send messenger after
messenger every four hours, till I have a favourable
answer; the one to meet the other, till its eve
arrives, to know if I may venture to appear in your
presence, with the hope of having my wishes answered
on that day. 
Your love, Madam, I neither expect, nor ask for; 
nor will, till my future behaviour gives you cause to
think I deserve it. All I at present presume to wish,
is, To have it in my power to do you all the justice
I can now do you: And to your generosity will I
leave it, to reward me, as I shall merit, with your
affection. 
At present, revolving my poor behaviour of Friday
night before you, I think I should sooner choose
to go to my last audit, unprepared for it as I am,
than to appear in your presence, unless you give me
some hope, that I shall be received as your elected
husband, rather than (however deserved) as a detested
criminal. 
Let me therefore propose an expedient, in order
to spare my own confusion; and to spare you the
necessity for that soul-harrowing recrimination, which
I cannot stand, and which must be disagreeable to
yourself—To name the church; and I will have
every thing in readiness; so that our next interview
will be, in a manner, at the very altar; and then
you will have the kind husband to forgive for the
faults of the ingrateful lover. If your resentment be
still too high to write more, let it only be, in your
own dear hand, these words, St. Martin's church,
Thursday—or these, St. Giles's church, Thursday; 
nor will I insist upon any inscription, or subscription,
or so much as the initials of your name. This shall be
all the favour I will expect, till the dear hand itself is
given to mine, in presence of that Being whom I
invoke as a witness of the inviolable faith and honour
of 
Your adoring
Lovelace.
