But at length succeeds in his attempts upon both. 
Having thus gained a complete victory over
the affections of these two ladies, he began
to convert his good fortune to the purposes
of that principle, from which his view was
never, no not for a moment, detached. In other
words, he used them as ministers and purveyors
to his avarice and fraud. As for the
mother in law, she was of herself so liberal as
to anticipate the wishes of any moderate adventurer,
and presented with sundry valuable jewels,
as memorials of her esteem; nor was the
daughter backward in such expressions of regard; 
she already considered his interest as her
own, and took frequent opportunities of secreting,
for his benefit, certain stray trinkets that
she happened to pick up in her excursions
within doors. 
All these gratifications he received with demonstrations
of infinite constraint and reluctance,
and in the midst of his rapacious extortion,
acted so cunningly as to impose himself upon
both, for a miracle of disinterested integrity. 
Yet not contented with what he thus could
earn, and despairing of being able to steer the
bark of his fortune for any length of time, between 

two such dangerous quicksands, he resolved
to profit by the occasion while it lasted, and
strike some considerable stroke at once. A plan
was formed in consequence of this determination,
and at an appointment with the mother,
in the house of their female friend, our adventurer
appeared with an air of dejection, which
he veiled with a thin cover of forced pleasantry,
that his mistress might suppose he endeavoured
to conceal some mortal chagrin that
preyed upon his heart. 
The stratagem succeded to his wish: she observed
his countenance between whiles overcast,
took notice of the involuntary sighs he
heaved; and with the most tender expressions
of sympathy, conjured him to make her acquainted
with the cause of his affliction. Instead
of gratifying her request immediately,
he evaded her questions with a respectful reserve,
implying, that his love would not suffer
him to make her a partner in his sorrow; and
this delicacy on his part, whetted her impatience
and concern to such a degree, that rather
than keep her in such an agony of doubt and
apprehension, he was prevailed upon to tell
her, that he had been the preceeding night
engaged with a company of his fellow students,
where he had made too free with the champaigne,
so that his caution forsook him, and
he had been decoyed into a play by a Tyroleze
gamester, who stripped him of all his
ready money, and obtained from him, an obligation
for two hundred florins, which he could
not possibly pay, without having recourse to
his relation, the count de Melvile, who would 

have just cause to be incensed at his extravagance. 
This information he concluded, by declaring,
that, cost what it would, he was resolved to
make a candid confession of the truth, and
throw himself entirely upon the generosity of
his patron, who could inflict no other punishment
than that of discarding him from his favour
and protection: a misfortune, which,
how grievous soever it might be, he should be
able to sustain with fortitude, could he fall
upon some method of satisfying the Tyrolese,
who was very importunate and savage in his
demand. His kind mistress no sooner found
out the source of his inquietude, than she promised
to dry it up, assuring him that next day
at the same hour, she would enable him to discharge
the debt; so that he might set his heart
at ease, and recollect that gaiety which was the
soul of her enjoyment. 
He expressed the utmost astonishment at this
generous proffer, which, however, he declined
with an affected earnestness of refusal, protesting
that he should be extremely mortified, if
he thought she looked upon him as one of
those mercenary gallants, who could make
such a sordid use of a lady's affection. “No,
madam,” cried our politician in a pathetic
strain, “whatever happens, I shall never part
with that internal consolation that conscious
honour never fails to yield in the deepest scenes
of solitary distress: the attachment I have the
honour to profess for your amiable person, is
not founded on such inglorious motives; but,
is the genuine result of that generous passion,
which none but the noble-minded feel, and 

the only circumstance of this misfortune, that
I dread to encounter, is, the necessity of withdrawing
myself for ever, from the presence of
her, whose genial smiles could animate my soul
against all the persecution of adverse fortune.” 
This declamation, accompanied with a profound
sigh, served only to inflame her desire
of extricating him from the difficulty in which
he was involved. She exhausted all her eloquence
in attempting to persuade him that his
refusal was an outrage against her affection:
he pretended to refute her arguments, and remained
unshaken by all the power of her sollicitations; 
until she had recourse to the most
passionate remonstrances of love, and fell at
his feet in the posture of a forlorn shepherdess. 
What he refused to her reason, he granted to
her tears, because his heart was melted by her
affliction, and next day condescended to accept
of her money, out of pure regard to her happiness
and peace. 
Encouraged by the success of this atchievement,
he resolved to practise the same experiment
upon Wilhelmina, in hope of extracting
an equal share of profit from her simplicity
and attachment; and at their very next nocturnal
rendezvous in her chamber, re-acted the
farce already rehearsed; with a small variation,
which he thought necessary to stimulate the
young lady in his behalf. He rightly concluded,
that she was by no means mistress of such
a considerable sum as he had already extorted
from her mother; and therefore thought proper
to represent himself in the most urgent
predicament, that her apprehension, on his account,
might be so alarmed, as to engage her 

in some enterprize for his advantage, which,
otherwise, she would never have dreamed of
undertaking. With this view, after having
described his own calamitous situation, in consequence
of her pressing intreaties, which he
affected to evade, he gave her to understand,
that there was no person upon earth, to whom
he would have recourse in this emergency; 
for which reason, he was determined to rid
himself of all his cares at once, upon the friendly
point of his own faithful sword. 
Such a dreadful resolution could not fail to
operate upon the tender passions of his Dulcinea; 
she was instantly seized with an agony of
fear and distraction: her grief manifested itself
in a flood of tears, while she hung round
his neck, conjuring him, in the most melting
terms, by their mutual love, in which they had
been so happy, to lay aside that fatal determination,
which would infallibly involve her in
the same fate; for she took Heaven to witness,
that she would not one moment survive the
knowledge of his death. 
He was not deficient in expressions of reciprocal
regard: he extolled her love and tenderness
with a most extravagant eulogium; 
and seemed wrung with mortal anguish at the
prospect of parting for ever from his lovely
Wilhelmina; but his honour was a stern and
rigid creditor, that could not be appeased, except
with his blood; and all the boon she
could obtain, by dint of the most woeful supplication,
was a promise to defer the execution
of his baleful purpose, for the space of four
and twenty hours, during which, she hoped,
Heaven would compassionate her sufferings, 

and inspire her with some contrivance for
their mutual relief. Thus he yielded to her
fervent request, rather with a view to calm the
present transports of her sorrow, than with
any expectation of seeing himself redeemed
from his fate, by her interposition; such at
least were his professions, when he took his
leave, assuring her, that he would not quit his
being, before he should have devoted a few
hours to another interview with the dear object
of his love. 
Having thus kindled the train, he did not
doubt that the mine of his craft would take effect,
and repaired to his own lodging, in full
persuasion of seeing his aim accomplished, before
the time fixed for their last assignation. 
His prognostic was next morning verefied by
the arrival of a messenger, who brought to
him a small parcel, to which was cemented
with sealing-wax, the following epistle: 

“Jewel of my soul!
Scarce had you, last night, quitted my
disconsolate arms, when I happily recollected,
that there was in my possession, a gold
chain, of value more than sufficient to answer
the exigence of your present occasions: 
It was pledged to my grand-father for two
hundred crowns, by a Knight of Malta,
who soon after perished in a sea-engagement
with the enemies of our faith; so that
it became the property of our house, and
was bequeathed to me by the old gentleman,
as a memorial of his particular affection. 
Upon whom can I more properly bestow it,
than him who is already master of my heart! 

receive it, therefore, from the bearer of
this billet, and convert it without scruple to
that use which shall be most conducive to
your ease and satisfaction; nor seek, from
a too romantic notion of honour, which I
know you entertain, to excuse yourself,
from accepting this testimony of my affection:
for I have already sworn before an
image of our blessed lady, that I will no
longer own you as the sovereign of my heart,
nor even indulge you with another interview,
if you reject this mark of tenderness
and concern, from your ever faithful 
“Wilhelmina.” 
The heart of our adventurer began to
bound with joy, when he surveyed the contents
of this letter; and his eyes sparkled with
transport at sight of the chain, which he immediately
perceived to be worth twice the sum
she had mentioned. Nevertheless, he would
not avail himself without further question of
her generosity; but, that same night, repairing
to her apartment at the usual hour of
meeting, he prostrated himself before her,
and counterfeiting extreme agitation of spirit,
begged, in the most urgent terms, not even
unaccompanied with tears, that she would take
back the present which he tendered for her
acceptance; and spare him the most insufferable
mortification of thinking himself exposed
to the imputation of being mercenary in his
love. Such, he said, was the delicacy of his
passion, that he could not possibly exist under
the apprehension of incurring a censure so unworthy
of his sentiments; and he would a 

thousand times, sooner undergo the persecution
of his rancorous creditor, than bear the
thought of being in the smallest consideration
lessened in her esteem: nay, so far did he carry
his pretensions to punctilio, as to protest
that should she refuse to quiet the scruples of
his honour, on this score, her unyielding beneficence
would serve only to hasten the execution
of his determined purpose, to withdraw
himself at once from a life of vanity
and misfortune. 
The more pathetically he pleaded for her
compliance, the more strenuously did she resist
his remonstrances. She advanced all the
arguments her reason, love and terror could
suggest, reminded him of her oath, from
which, he could not suppose she would
recede, whatever the consequence might be; 
and in conclusion, vowed to Heaven, with great
solemnity and devotion, that she would not
survive the news of his death. Thus the alternative
she offered, was either to retain the
chain and be happy in her affection, or forfeit
all title to her love, and die in the conviction
of having brought his innocent mistress to an
untimely grave. 
His fortitude was not proof against this last
consideration: “My savage honour,” said he,
“would enable me to endure the pangs of
eternal separation, in the confidence of being
endowed with the power of ending these tortures
by the energy of my own hand; but
the prospect of Wilhelmina's death, and that
too occasioned by my inflexibility, disarms my
soul of all her resolution, swallows up the
dictates of my jealous pride, and fills my bosom 

with such a gush of tenderness and sorrow,
as overwhelms the whole œconomy of
my purpose! Yes, inchanting creature! I sacrifice
my glory to that irresistible reflection:
and rather than know myself the cruel instrument
of robbing the world of such perfection,
consent to retain the fatal testimony of your
love.” 
So saying, he pocketed the chain, with an
air of ineffable mortification, and was rewarded
for his compliance with the most endearing
caresses of his Dulcinea, who, amidst the tumults
of his joy, ejaculated a thousand acknowledgments
to Heaven, for having blessed her with
the affection of such a man, whose honour was
unrivalled by any thing but his love.
