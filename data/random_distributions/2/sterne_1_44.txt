The bird in his cage pursued
me into my room; I sat down
close to my table, and leaning my
head upon my hand, I begun to
figure to myself the miseries of confinement. 
I was in a right frame
for it, and so I gave full scope to my
imagination. 
I was going to begin with the
millions of my fellow creatures born
to no inheritance but slavery; but
finding, however affecting the picture
was, that I could not bring it 

near me, and that the multitude of
of sad groups in it did but distract
me— 
—I took a single captive, and having
first shut him up in his dungeon,
I then look'd through the twilight of
his grated door to take his picture. 
I beheld his body half wasted away
with long expectation and confinement,
and felt what kind of sickness of
the heart it was which arises from hope
deferr'd. Upon looking nearer I saw
him pale and feverish: in thirty years
the western breeze had not once fann'd
his blood—he had seen no sun, no
moon in all that time—nor had the 

voice of friend or kinsman breathed
through his lattice—his children— 
But here my heart began to bleed,
and I was forced to go on with
another part of the portrait. 
He was sitting upon the ground
upon a little straw, in the furthest
corner of his dungeon, which was
alternately his chair and bed: a little
calendar of small sticks were laid at the
head notch'd all over with the dismal
days and nights he had pass'd there— 
he had one of these little sticks in his
hand, and with a rusty nail he was
etching another day of misery to add
to the heap. As I darkened the little
light he had, he lifted up a hopeless 

eye towards the door, then cast it
down, shook his head, and went on
with his work of affliction. I heard
his chains upon his legs, as he turn'd
his body to lay his little stick upon the
bundle—He gave a deep sigh—I saw
the iron enter into his soul—I burst
into tears—I could not sustain the
picture of confinement which my
fancy had drawn—I started up from
my chair, and calling La Fleur, I
bid him bespeak me a remise, and have
it ready at the door of the hotel by
nine in the morning. 
I'll go directly, said I, myself to
Monsieur le Duke de Choiseul. 

La Fleur would have put me to
bed; but not willing he should see
any thing upon my cheek, which
would cost the honest fellow a heartache,
I told him I would go to bed
by myself—and bid him go do the
same.
