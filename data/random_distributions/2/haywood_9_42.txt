May properly enough come under the denomination of an appendix to the three last preceding chapters, as containing some things which ought to have been inserted in them. 
The fair fugitive now thought she had related all that was expected from her; but lady Speck, perceiving she had done speaking, prevented what any of the rest of the company would have said on that occasion, by crying out hastily,—‘Madam, you have not given us an account of the manner of your escaping the misfortune you so much dreaded;—we see you here, but know not by what means you are so,—without which your history will be imperfect.’ 
‘As I may perhaps have been too circumstantial in some parts of my narrative, reply'd she, I was cautious not to weary out your patience by any farther particulars of an event so little deserving your regard;—but as you are so good to afford me your attention, 
I shall readily make you a detail of whatever pass'd from the moment of my resolving to fly my father's house to that of my arrival at a place where I have the honour to be so generously entertain'd; and I am the more glad to do it, as there is indeed one thing which, in common justice to the gentleman who made his addresses to me, I ought not to have omitted.’ 
“As to my departure, pursued she, nothing was more easy to be accomplish'd;—no one suspected I had any thoughts of it, so no care was taken to prevent my flight, either by confining my person or setting any body to observe my motions;—but I was willing to take such of my things as I could conveniently carry with me; this requir'd some contrivance;—there was no possibility of sending a trunk or portmanteau out of the house, therefore found I was obliged to leave every thing behind me which I could not be the porter of myself. 
“My sister was mighty busy all that afternoon in her domestic affairs;—I employ'd that time in looking over my wearing apparel and made the best assortment of them I could, selecting 
those which I thought I could least support the want of;—my fine laces I cramm'd into a handkerchief, in order to put into my pockets; and the more bulky part of my linnen, with some upper garments, I tied in two pillowcases, and then essay'd whether I could carry them on each side under my hoop-petticoat, and found I could do it very well;—certainly these vast French hoops were invented chiefly for the convenience of those who carry about them what they want should be conceal'd.” 
Not only mr. Lovegrove, but the ladies themselves laugh'd heartily at this reflection on their mode;—but they would not interrupt her, and she went on: 
“Finding I was able to walk under the burthens I had prepared, at least as far as out of the sight of our house, I put them all together into a large trunk, pack'd up as they were, ready for a march next morning; for I thought it not adviseable to go that night, as lying at any house in town might endanger a discovery, and I knew that no carriage of any kind would set out before day-break. 
“After this I sat down and consider'd what more was to be done before I went away,—my father till now had always been most indulgent to me,—humour'd me in every thing; and even this last act of power, cruel as it was, I know was kindly meant;—I could not therefore think of leaving him, perhaps for ever, without letting him see I had not quite forgot the reverence I owed him. 
“I then took pen and paper and wrote a letter to him;—I cannot remember exactly the expressions I made use of, but know they were as pathetic as could be dictated by a heart overflowing, as mine was, with filial love and grief. 
“I told him that I had exerted the whole force of my endeavours to obey him;—that my reason and the insurmountable aversion I had to the match he proposed, had occasion'd conflicts in my breast which life could scarce sustain; that I fled not from the presence of the best of fathers, but to avoid being guilty of a deed, which would have been yet more grievous to him;—begg'd him to forgive me, 
and to rest assured that to what exigencies soever I might be reduced in this forlorn and helpless condition, nothing should tempt me to bring disgrace upon my family or dishonour to myself. 
“Having finish'd this melancholy epistle, I threw it into the drawer of a little escrutore, designing to take it with me in the morning and send it to my father by the penny-post;—but, good God! how great was my confusion, when happening to look over some writings I have there, I know not for what reason, for I had nothing which I fear'd should be exposed after I was gone, one of the first things I laid my hands on was the very paper I had wrote to my lover, and thought I had given to him. 
“I did not presently conceive how this could be;—I knew I had wrote no copy, and that it was the same which I had been certain of having deliver'd to him; but at last I remember'd, that not being able to give it to him on the day I intended, I had put it into this drawer to prevent its being seen by any accident;—and this recollection convinced me, that instead 
of a letter of complaint he had received from me a foolish love song, though set to very good music, which a lady of my acquaintance had desired me to write out for her, and I thought, as I could not find it, I had dropt it from my pocket,—It began thus: 
“Dearest Damon would you shew
“What a faithful man can do,
 “Love me ever,
 “Leave me never.”
She was proceeding, but mr. Lovegrove was so highly diverted with this incident, that he could not forbear interrupting her,—‘By Heaven, madam, said he, it would have been cruel in you to have made us lose so agreeable a part of your history.’ 
The ladies express'd themselves in much the same manner;—‘I cannot help laughing, cried lady Speck, to think of the old gentleman's transports on receiving so fond a remonstrance from his young mistress;’—‘Nor I, subjoin'd miss Wingman, at the idea how much he must be mortified when he found himself deceived.’ —‘For my part, said Jenny, in a more serious air, I pity the poor man, and am heartily sorry for the 
lady, who but for this mistake might not perhaps have been driven to the necessity of quitting her father's house.’ 
“It is utterly impossible, madam, reply'd the other, resuming the thread of her discourse, to know what would have happen'd, had this not been the case;—I was, however, so much shock'd at the thoughts of what I had done, that I resolved to let him continue in his error no longer than I had it in my power to convince him of it;—to this end I inclosed the letter I had design'd for him in another piece of paper, in which I wrote,—I think to this effect: 
“Sir,
The silly paper, which by mistake I put into your hands, must certainly have given you a very odd opinion both of my understanding and sincerity. 
“This will, however, undeceive you as to the latter, by shewing you I meant not to disguise the true situation of my heart, which had you sooner known, perhaps I might not have been the wretch I am;—but it is now too late, and all the hopes I flatter'd myself with 
from your generosity and compassion are vanish'd into air. 
“Yes, sir, the agreement made between my father and yourself drives me from all I once thought happiness; but beg you to believe that I shall always retain a grateful sense of the advantages offer'd me by your love, how miserable soever it has made me, and shall never cease to wish you may long enjoy all those blessings in life which cruel destiny denies any part of to 
“The forlorn, &c. 

“To this, continued she, I added a postscript, to let him know that I left behind me the watch which he had been so good to present me with, and doubted not but my father would return it to him as soon as my flight should be discover'd. 
“Having dispatch'd all that I thought necessary for my going, my mind for some moments was as easy and composed as if the preparations I had been making were only for a journey of pleasure;—but alas, the sad occasion soon recoiled upon me, and fill'd me with most gloomy apprehensions. 
“My father came home in the evening in so jocose a humour as hinder'd him from observing that melancholy which I could not else have been able to hide from him;—he had, indeed, been drinking more freely than he was accustom'd; and I found also by what he said, that my lover, by toasting my health too plentifully, had render'd himself incapable of waiting on me that night. 
“Nothing material happen'd afterwards to the time of my elopement, which every thing seem'd to favour;—my sister went very early in the morning to Covent-Garden to buy fruit for the desert, taking one of the men with her to bring home what purchases she made;—the other was busy in cleaning the plate;—all the maids were in the kitchen, and my father was yet in bed;—so the coast being entirely clear, I tyed my paniers to my sides,—stuffed my pockets with as much as they would contain, and went directly out of the house without being seen by any body; though I believe whoever had met me would not have guess'd in what manner I was equipp'd;—I made all the haste I 
could out of the street however,—stept into the first hackney coach I found, and drove to a place where I remembered to have seen second-hand cloaths hung up for sale,—there I bought this riding-hood, which I thought would be some kind of a disguise. 
“Bristol being just opposite to that part of Ireland where my aunt lives, I had no other route to take; but in the hurry of my thoughts, had never once consider'd that as I had secured no place in the stage-coach it was a thousand against one if there would be any room for me in it at this season of the year. 
“I did not forget, however, in my way to the inn, to put the letters I had wrote to my father and lover into the penny-post, but found when I came there the coach was not only full but had set out above an hour before;—this put me into great perplexity; but I was now embark'd on an expedition, and must go through it some how or other;—the Windsor stage was just going out, and had a place which I gladly fill'd, in order to be so far on my journey. 
“On my arrival there, I was at as great a loss as before; but being told that if I hired a chaise to Maidenhead I might possibly find a place in some one or other of the coaches that put in there,—I took this advice, but would not lie in that town lest I should be seen by some persons of my acquaintance that lived there, so drove on to this village, which I thought would answer my purpose as well, as I should catch the coaches as they pass'd by this morning;—I got up very early that I might be ready for the first, for it was indifferent to me in which I went, provided they took the road I wanted to go; but my hopes deceived me, every one that came this way was full. 
“But this was not the only, nor the worst disappointment I met with at this place;—having laid out what loose money I had about me, I thought to have recourse to my purse, in which, besides sufficient to defray the expences of my journey, there was a diamond ring which had been my mother's, and a medal which I set a high value upon;—not finding it presently I was very much alarm'd,—I pull'd every thing out of my pockets that 
were in them, but the examination only serv'd to convince me that what I sought was lost;—I know not how this accident happen'd, nor is it of any importance. 
“It is easy to conceive how terrible a misfortune this was to a person in my present circumstances;—I should have been driven to the last despair, if a thought had not occurr'd to me, that the little box I took the liberty of sending by the woman of the house might be acceptable to some one or other of this company.” 
Here ended all she had to say, but the conclusion was accompanied with some tears, which notwithstanding robb'd the eyes from which they fell, of no part of their lustre.
