Mr. Belford, To Miss Clarissa Harlowe. 

Friday, Aug. 4. 
Madam,
I am so sensible of the honour done me in yours of
this day, that I would not delay for one moment
the answering of it. I hope you will live to see many
happy years; and to be your own Executrix in those
points which your heart is most set upon. But, in
case of survivorship, I most chearfully accept of the
Sacred Office you are pleased to offer me; and you
may absolutely rely upon my Fidelity, and, if possible,
upon the literal performance of every arricle you
shall enjoin me. 
The effect of the kind wish you conclude with, has
been my concern ever since I have been admitted to
the honour of your conversation. It shall be my
whole endeavour that it be not vain. The happiness
of approaching you, which this Trust, as I presume,
will give me frequent opportunities of doing, must
necessarily promote the desirable end; since it will
be impossible to be a witness of your Piety, Equanimity,
and other virtues, and not aspire to emulate 

you. All I beg is, That you will not suffer any
future Candidate, or Event, to displace me; unless
some new instances of unworthiness appear either in
the morals or behaviour of, 
Madam,
Your most obliged and faithful Servant,
J. Belfoed.
