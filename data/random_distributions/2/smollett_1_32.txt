He by accident encounters his old friend, with
whom he holds a conference, and renews a
treaty. 
Our Hero having thus provided himself
with a proper subject for his hours of
dalliance, thought it was now high time to
study the ground which he had pitched upon
for the scene of his exploits, and with that
view made several excursions to different parts
of the town, where there was ought of entertainment
or instruction to be found: yet he
always, on these occasions, appeared in an obscure
ordinary dress, in order to avoid singularity,
and never went twice to the same coffee--house,
that his person might not be afterwards
known, in case he should shine forth to the
public, in a superior sphere. On his return
from one of these expeditions, while he was
passing through Ludgate, his eyes were suddenly
encountered, by the apparition of his old friend
the Tyroleze, who perceiving himself fairly
caught in the toil, made a virtue of necessity,
and running up to our adventurer with an
aspect of eagerness and joy, clasped him in his
arms, as some dear friend, whom he had casually 

found after a most tedious and disagreeable
separation. 
Fathom, whose genius never failed him in
such emergencies, far from receiving these advances
with the threats and reproaches which
the other had deserved at his hands, returned
the salute with equal warmth, and was really
over-joyed at meeting with a person, who might
one way or other make amends for the perfidy
of his former conduct. The Tyroleze,
whose name was Ratchkali, pleased with his
reception, proposed they should adjourn to
the next tavern, in which they had no sooner
taken possession of an apartment, than he
addressed himself to his old companion in these
words. 
“Mr Fathom, by your frank and obliging
manner of treating a man who hath done you
wrong, I am more and more confirmed in my
opinion of your sagacity, which I have often
considered with admiration: I will not therefore
attempt to make an apology for my conduct
at our last parting; but only assure you
that this meeting may turn out to our mutual
advantage, if we now re-enter into an unreserved
union, the ties of which we will soon find it
our interest and inclination to preserve. For
my own part, as my judgment is ripened by
experience, so are my sentiments changed since
our last association. I have seen many a rich
harvest lost, for want of a fellow labourer in
the vineyard; and I have more than once fallen
a sacrifice to a combination, which I could
have resisted with the help of one able auxiliary. 
Indeed I might prove what I alledge by mathematical
demonstration; and I believe no body 

will pretend to deny, that two heads are better
than one, in all cases that require discernment
and deliberation.” 
Ferdinand could not help owning the sanity
of his observations, and forthwith acquiesced
in his proposal of the new alliance; desiring to
know the character in which he acted in the
English stage, and the scheme he would offer
for their mutual emolument: at the same time
he resolved within himself, to keep such a strict
eye over his future actions, as would frustrate
any design he might hereafter harbour, of repeating
the prank he had so successfully played
upon him, in their journey from the banks of
the Rhine. 
“Having quitted you at Bar le duc,” resumed
the Tyroleze, “I travelled without ceasing,
until I arrived at Franckfort upon the Maine,
where I assumed the character of a French chevalier,
and struck some masterly strokes, which
you yourself would not have deemed unworthy
of your invention; and my success was the
more agreeable, as my operations were chiefly
carried on against the enemies of our religion:
but my prosperity was not of long duration. 
Seeing they could not foil me at my own weapons,
they formed a damned conspiracy, by
which I not only lost all the fruits of my industry,
but likewise ran the most imminent hazard
of my life. I had ordered some of those jewels
which I had borrowed of my good friend
Fathom, to be new set in a fashionable taste,
and soon after had an opportunity to sell one
of these at a great advantage, to one of the
fraternity, who offered an extraordinary price
for the stone, on purpose to effect my ruin. 

In less than four and twenty hours after this
bargain, I was arrested by the officers of justice,
upon the oath of the purchaser, who undertook
to prove me guilty of a fraud, in selling
a Saxon pebble for a real diamond; and
this accusation was actually true; for the
change had been artfully put upon me, by the
jeweller, who was himself engaged in the
conspiracy. 
Had my conscience been clear of any other
impeachment, perhaps, I should have rested
my cause upon the equity and protection of
the law; but I foresaw that the trial would
introduce an inquiry, to which I was not at
all ambitious of submitting, and therefore
was fain to compromise the affair, at the price
of almost my whole fortune. Yet this acommodation
was not made so secretly, but that
my character was blasted, and my credit overthrown; 
so that I was fain to relinquish my
occasional equipage, and hire myself as journeyman
to a lapidary, an employment which
I had excercised in my youth. In this obscure
station, I laboured with great assiduity, until I
made myself perfect in the knowledge of stones,
as well as in the different methods of setting
them off to the best advantage; and having,
by dint of industry and address, got possession
of a small parcel, set out for this kingdom,
in which I happily arrived about four months
ago; and surely England is the paradise of artists
of our profession. 
One would imagine, that nature had created
the inhabitants, for the support and enjoyment
of adventurers like you and me. Not
that these islanders open the arms of hospitality 

to all foreigners without distinction: on the
contrary, they inherit from their fathers, an
unreasonable prejudice against all nations under
the sun; and when an Englishman happens
to quarrel with a stranger, the first term of
reproach he uses, is the name of his antagonist's
country, characterized by some opprobrious
epithet; such as a chattering Frenchman,
an Italian ape, a German hog, and a
beastly Dutchman; nay, their national prepossession
is maintained even against those people
with whom they are united, under the same
laws and government; for nothing is more
common than to hear them exclaim against
their fellow-subjects, in the expressions of a
beggarly Scot, and an impudent Irish bog-trotter. 
Yet this very prejudice will never
fail to turn to the account of every stranger
possessed of ordinary talents; for he will always
find opportunities of conversing with them
in Coffee-houses, and places of public resort,
in spite of their professed reserve, which, by
the by, is so extraordinary, that I know some
people who have lived twenty years in the same
house, without exchanging one word with
their next door neighbours; yet provided he
can talk sensibly, and preserve the deportment
of a sober gentleman, in those occasional conversations,
his behaviour will be the more remarkably
pleasing, as it will agreeably disappoint
the expectation of the person, who had
entertained notions to his prejudice. When a
foreigner has once crossed this bar, which
perpetually occurs, he sails without further
difficulty into the harbour of an Englishman's
good will; for the pique is neither personal 

nor rancorous, but rather contemptuous and
national; so that while he despises a people in
the lump, an individual of that very community,
may be one of his chief favourites. 
The English are in general upright and honest,
therefore unsuspecting and credulous:
they are too much engrossed with their own
business, to pry into the conduct of their
neighbours, and too indifferent, in point of
disposition, to interest themselves, in what
they conceive to be foreign to their own concerns. 
They are wealthy and mercantile, of
consequence liberal and adventurous, and so
well disposed to take a man's own word for
his importance, that they suffer themselves
to be prayed upon by such a bungling
set of impostors, as would starve for lack
of address, in any other country under
the sun. This being a true sketch of the British
character, so far as I have been able to
observe and learn, you will easily comprehend
the profits that may be extracted from it, by
virtue of those arts by which you so eminently
excel; the great the unbounded prospect lies
before me! Indeed, I look upon this opulent
kingdom, as a wide and fertile common, on
which we adventurers may range for prey,
without let or molestation: for so jealous are
the natives of their liberty, that they will not
bear the restraint of necessary Police, and an
able artist may enrich himself with their spoils,
without running any risque of attracting the
notice of the magistrate, or incurring the least
penalty of the law. 
In a word, this metropolis is a vast masquerade,
in which a man of stratagem may wear a 

thousand different disguises, without danger of
detection. There is a variety of shapes, in
which we knights of the industry, make our appearance
in London. One glides into a nobleman's
house in the capacity of a valet de chambre,
and in a few months leads the whole family
by the nose. Another exhibits himself to
the public, as an empiric or operator for the
teeth: and by dint of assurance and affidavits,
bearing testimony to wonderful cures that never
were performed, whirls himself into his
chariot, and lays the town under contribution:
a third professes the composition of musick, as
well as the performance, and by means of a
few  Capriciosos on the violin, properly introduced,
wriggles himself into the management
of private and public concerts; and a fourth
breaks forth at once in all the splendor of a
gay equipage, under the title and denomination
of a foreign count. Not to mention those inferior
projectors, who assume the characters of
dancers, fencing-masters, and French ushers,
or by renouncing their religion, seek to obtain
a provision for life. 
Either of these parts will turn to the account
of an able actor; and as you are equally qualified
for all, you may choose that which is most
suitable to your own inclination: though in
my opinion, you was designed by nature, to
shine in the great world, which, after all, is the
most ample field, for men of genius; because
the game is deeper, and people of fashion being,
for the most part, more ignorant, indolent,
vain and capricious, than their inferiors, are of
consequence more easily deceived; besides
their morals sit generally so loose about them 

that when a gentleman of our fraternity is discovered
in the exercise of his profession, their
contempt of his skill is the only disgrace he incurs.” 
Our hero was so well pleased with this picture,
that he longed to peruse the original, and
before these two friends parted, they settled all
the operations of the campaign. Ratchkali,
that same evening, hired magnificent lodgings
for count Fathom, in the court end of the
town, and furnished his wardrobe and liveries
from the spoils of Monmouth-street; he likewise
enlisted another footman and valet de
chambre into his service, and sent to the apartments
divers large trunks, supposed to be filled
with the baggage of this foreign nobleman,
though in reality, they contained little else
than common lumber. 
Next day, our adventurer took possession of
his new habitation, after having left to his friend
and associate the task of dismissing the unfortunate
Ellenor, who was so shocked at the unexpected
message, that she fainted away; and
when she recovered the use of her senses, so
well as to reflect upon her forlorn condition,
she was seized with the most violent transports
of grief and dismay, by which her brain was
disordered to such a degree, that she grew furious
and distracted, and was, by the advice and
assistance of the Tyroleze, conveyed into the
hospital of Bethlem; where we shall leave her
for the present, happily bereft of her reason.
