Docter Lews,
GIVE me leaf to tell you, methinks you
mought employ your talons better, than to encourage
servants to pillage their masters—I find by
Gwyllim, that Villiams has got my skin; for
which he is an impotent rascal. He has not only
got my skin, but, moreover, my butter-milk to fatten
his pigs; and, I suppose, the next thing he gets,
will be my pad to carry his daughter to church and
fair: Roger gets this, and Roger gets that; but I'd
have you to know, I won't be rogered at this rate 

by any ragmatical fellow in the kingdom—And I
am surprized, doctor Lews, you would offer to put
my affairs in composition with the refuge and skim
of the hearth. I have toiled and moyled to a good
purpuss, for the advantage of Matt's family, if I
can't safe as much owl as will make me an under
petticoat. As for the butter-milk, ne'er a pig in
the parish shall thrust his snout in it, with my good
will. There's a famous physician at the Hot Well,
that prescribes it to his patience, when the case is
consumptive; and the Scots and Irish have begun
to drink it already, in such quantities, that there
is not a drop lest for the hogs in the whole neighbourhood
of Bristol. I'll have our buttermilk barrelled
up, and sent twice a week to Aberginny,
where it may be sold for a halfpenny the quart; 
and so Roger may carry his pigs to another market
—I hope, Doctor, you will not go to put any
more such phims in my brother's head, to the prejudice
of my pockat; but rather give me some raisins
(which hitherto you have not done) to subscribe
myself 
your humble servant,
Tabitha Bramble. 
Bath, May 19.
