A brief detail of his education. 
Nothing could have more seasonably happened,
to confirm the good opinion
which the colonel entertained of Ferdinand's
principles: his intentions towards the boy grew
every day more and more warm; and immediately
after the peace of Passarowitz, he retired
to his own house at Presburg, and presented
young Fathom to his lady, not only as the son
of a person to whom he owed his life, but also
as a lad, who merited his peculiar protection
and regard by his own personal virtue. The
countess, who was an Hungarian, received him
with great kindness and affability, and her son
was ravished with the prospect of enjoying such
a companion: in short, fortune seemed to
have provided for him an asylum, in which he
might be safely trained up, and suitably prepared 

for more important scenes of life, than any
of his ancestors had ever known. 
He was not, in all respects, entertained on the
footing of his young master; yet he shared in
all his education and amusements, as one whom
the old gentleman was fully determined to qualify
for the station of an officer in the service; 
and if he did not eat with the count, he was
every day regaled with choice bits from his
table; holding, as it were, a middle place between
the rank of a relation, and favoured domestic. 
Although his patron maintained a tutor
in the house, to superintend the conduct of his
heir, he committed the charge of his learning to
the instructions of a publick school; where, he
imagned, the boy would imbibe a laudable spirit
of emulation among his fellows, which could
not fail of turning out to the advantage of his
education. Ferdinand was entered in the same
academy; and the two lads proceeded equally
in the paths of erudition; a mutual friendship
and intimacy soon ensued, and notwithstanding
the levity and caprice commonly discernible in
the behaviour of such boys, very few, or rather
no quarrels happened in the course of their
communication. Yet their dispositions were
altogether different, and their talents unlike. 
Nay, this dissimilarity was the very bond of
their union; because it prevented that jealousy
and rivalship which often interrupts the harmony
of two warm co-temporaries. 
The young count made extraordinary progress
in the exercises of the school, though he
seemed to take very little pains in the cultivation
of his studies; and became a perfect hero
in all the athletic diversions of his fellow-scholars; 
but, at the same time, exhibited such a 

bashful appearance and uncouth address, that
his mother despaired of ever seeing him improved
into any degree of polite behaviour. On
the other hand, Fathom, who was in point of
learning a mere dunce, became, even in his
childhood, remarkable among the ladies for
his genteel deportment and vivacity; they admired
the proficiency he made, under the directions
of his dancing master, the air with
which he performed his obeisance at his entrance
and exit; and were charmed with the
agreeable assurance and lively sallies of his conversation; 
while they expressed the utmost concern
and disgust at the boorish demeanour of
his companion, whose extorted bows resembled
the pawings of a mule, who hung his head in
silence, like a detected sheep-stealer, who sat
in company under the most aukward expressions
of constraint, and whose discourse never
exceeded the simple monosyllables of negation
and assent. 
In vain did all the females of the family propose
to him young Fathom, as a pattern and
reproach: he remained unaltered by all their
efforts and expostulations, and allowed our adventurer
to enjoy the triumph of his praise,
while he himself was conscious of his own superiority
in those qualifications which seemed of
more real importance than the meer exteriors
and forms of life. His present ambition was,
not to make a figure at his father's table, but
to eclipse his rivals at school, and to acquire
an influence and authority among these confederates. 
Nevertheless, Fathom might possibly
have fallen under his displeasure or contempt,
had not that pliant genius found means to retain 

his friendship by seasonable compliances
and submission; for the sole study, or at least
the chief aim of Ferdinand, was to make himself
necessary and agreeable to those on whom
his dependance was placed: his talent was in
this particular suited to his inclination; he seemed
to have inherited it from his mother's womb; 
and without all doubt, would have raised upon
it a most admirable superstructure of fortune
and applause, had not it been inseparably yoked
with a most insidious principle of self-love,
that grew up with him from the cradle, and left
no room in his heart for the least particle of
social virtue. This last, however, he knew so
well how to counterfeit, by means of a large
share of ductility and dissimulation, that, surely,
he was calculated by nature, to dupe even the
most cautious, and gratify his appetites by levying
contributions on all mankind. 
So little are the common instructors of youth,
qualified to judge the capacities of those who
are under their tutelage and care, that Fathom,
by dint of his insinuating arts, made shift to
pass upon the schoolmaster, as a lad of quick
parts, in despite of a natural inaptitude to retain
his lessons, which all his industry could
never overcome. In order to remedy, or rather
to cloak this defect in his understanding, he
had always recourse to the friendship of the
young count, who freely permitted him to
transcribe his exercises, until a small accident
happened, which had well-nigh put a stop to
these instances of his generosity. —The adventure,
inconsiderable as it is, we shall record, as
the first overt-act of Ferdinand's true character,
as well as an illustration of the opinion we have 

advanced, touching the blind and injudicious
decisions of a right pedagogue. 
Among other tasks imposed by the pedant,
upon the form to which our two companions
belonged, they were one evening ordered to
translate a chapter of Cæsar's commentaries. 
Accordingly the young count went to work,
and performed the undertaking with great elegance
and dispatch: Fathom having spent the
night in more effeminate amusements, was next
morning so much hurried for want of time,
that in his transcription, he neglected to insert
a few variations from the text; these being the
terms on which he was allowed to use it: so that
it was verbatim a copy of the original. As
those exercises were always delivered in a heap,
subscribed with the several names of the boys to
whom they belonged; the schoolmaster chanced
to peruse the version of Ferdinand, before he
looked into any of the rest, and could not help
bestowing upon it particular marks of approbation:
the next that fell under his examination
was that of the young count, when he immediately
perceived the sameness, and far from
imputing it to the true cause, upbraided him
with having copied the exercise of our adventurer,
and insisted upon chastising him upon
the spot, for his want of application. 
Had not the young gentleman thought his
honour was concerned, he would have submited
to the punishment without murmuring; but
he inherited from his parents the pride of two
fierce nations, and being overwhelmed with
reproaches, for that which, he imagined, ought
to have redounded to his glory, he could not
brook the indignity, and boldly affirmed, that 

he himself was the original, to whom Ferdinand
was beholden for his performance. The
school-master, nettled to find himself mistaken
in his judgment, resolved that the count should
have no cause to exult in the discovery he had
made, and, like a true flogger, actually whipt
him for having allowed Fathom to copy his
exercise. Nay, in the hope of vindicating his
own penetration, he took an opportunity of
questioning Ferdinand in private, concerning
the circumstances of the translation; and our
hero perceiving his drift, gave him such artful
and ambiguous answers, as persuaded him, that
the young count had acted the part of a plagiary,
and that the other had been restrained
from doing himself justice, by the consideration
of his own dependance. 
This profound director did not fail, in honour
of his own discernment, to whisper about
the misrepresentation, as an instance of the young
count's insolence, and Fathom's humility and
good sense. The story was circulated among
the servants, especially the maids belonging to the
family, whose favour our hero had acquired by
his engaging behaviour; and at length it reached
the ears of his patron, who, incensed at his
son's presumption and inhospitality, called him
to a severe account, when the young gentleman
absolutely denied the truth of the allegation,
and appealed to the evidence of Fathom himself. 
Our adventurer was accordingly summoned by
the father, and encouraged to declare the truth,
with an assurance of his constant protection; 
upon which, Ferdinand very wisely fell upon
his knees, and while the tears gushed from his
eyes, acquitted the young count of the imputation 

and expressed his apprehension, that the
report had been spread by some of his enemies,
who wanted to prejudice him in the opinion of
his patron. 
The old gentleman was not satisfied of his
son's integrity, by this declaration; being naturally
of a generous disposition, highly prepossessed
in favour of the poor orphan, and chagrined
at the unpromising appearance of his heir, he
suspected that Fathom was over-awed by the
fear of giving offence, and that notwithstanding
what he had said, the case really stood as it had
been represented. In this persuasion, he earnestly
exhorted his son to resist and combat with
any impulse he might feel within himself, tending
to selfishness, fraud or imposition; to encourage
every sentiment of candor and benevolence,
and to behave with moderation and affability
to all his fellow-creatures. He laid
upon him strong injunctions, not without a
mixture of threats, to consider Fathom as the
object of his peculiar regard; to respect him
as the son of the count's preserver, as a Briton,
a stranger, and above all an helpless orphan, to
whom the rights of hospitality were doubly
due. 
Such admonitions were not lost upon the
youth, who under the rough husk of his personal
exhibition, possessed a large share of generous
sensibility: without any formal professions
to his father, he resolved to govern himself
according to his remonstrances; and far
from conceiving the least spark of animosity
against Fathom, he looked upon the poor boy
as the innocent cause of his disgrace, and redoubled
his kindness towards him, that his honour 

might never again be called in question,
upon the same subject. Nothing is more liable
to misconstruction than an act of uncommon
generosity; one half of the world mistake the
motive, from want of ideas to conceive an instance
of beneficence, that soars so high above
the level of their own sentiments; and the rest
suspect it of something sinister or selfish, from
the suggestions of their own sordid and vicious
inclinations. The young count subjected himself
to such misinterpretation, among those who observed
the increased warmth of civility and complaisance
in his behaviour to Ferdinand: they
ascribed it to his desire of still profiting by our
adventurer's superior talents, by which alone
they supposed him enabled to maintain any degree
of reputation at school; or to the fear of
being convicted by him of some misdemeanour
of which he knew himself guilty. These suspicions
were not effaced by the conduct of Ferdinand,
who, when examined on the subject, managed
his answers in such a manner, as confirmed
their conjectures, while he pretended to
refute them, and at the same time acquired to
himself credit for his extraordinary discretion
and self-denial. 
If he exhibited such a proof of sagacity in
the twelfth year of his age, what might not be
expected from his finesse, in the maturity of
his faculties and experience? Thus secured in
the good graces of the whole family, he saw the
days of his puerility glide along in the most agreeable
elapse of caresses and amusement. He
never fairly plunged into the stream of school
education; but, by floating on the surface, imbibed
a small tincture of those different sciences, 

which his master pretended to teach; in short,
he resembled those vagrant swallows that skim
along the level of some pool or river, without
venturing to wet one feather in their wings,
except in the accidental pursuit of an inconsiderable
fly. Yet, though his capacity or inclination
was unsuited for studies of this kind,
he did not fail to manifest a perfect genius in
the acquisition of other more profitable arts. 
Over and above the accomplishments of address,
for which he hath been already celebrated,
he excelled all his fellows in his dexterity
at fives and billiards; was altogether unrivalled
in his skill at draughts and backgammon; 
began, even at these years, to understand the
moves and schemes of chess; and made himself
a meer adept in the mystery of cards, which
he learned in the course of his assiduities and
attention to the females of the house.
