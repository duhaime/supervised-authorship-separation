Any man, madam, reasoning upwards,
and observing the prodigious
suffusion of blood in my father's
countenance,—by means of which, (as
all the blood in his body seemed to rush
up into his face, as I told you) he must
have redden'd, pictorically and scientintically
speaking, six whole tints and a half,
if not a full octave above his natural colour:
—any man, madam, but my
uncle Toby, who had observed this, together
with the violent knitting of my father's
brows, and the extravagant contortion
of his body during the whole affair,
—would have concluded my father in a
rage; and taking that for granted,— 

had he been a lover of such kind of concord
as arises from two such instruments
being put into exact tune,—he would instantly
have skrew'd up his, to the same
pitch;—and then the devil and all had
broke loose—the whole piece, madam,
must have been played off like the sixth
of Avison Scarlatti—con furia,—like
mad. —Grant me patience! —What
has con furia,—con strepito,—or any
other hurlyburly word whatever to do
with harmony? 
Any man, I say, madam, but my uncle
Toby, the benignity of whose heart interpreted
every motion of the body in the
kindest sense the motion would admit of,
would have concluded my father angry
and blamed him too. My uncle Toby
blamed nothing but the taylor who cut
the pocket-hole;—so sitting still, till 

my father had got his handkerchief out
of it, and looking all the time up in his
face with inexpressible good will—my father
at length went on as follows.
