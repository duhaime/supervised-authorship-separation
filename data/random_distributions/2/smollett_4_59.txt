I resolve to ingratiate myself with the mother,
and am favoured by accident—the precise
lady finds her husband, and quits the coach— 
the captain is disappointed of his dinner— 
we arrive at Bath—I accompany Miss
Snapper to the long room, where she is attacked
by beau N&wblank;h, and turns the
laugh against him—I make love to her,
and receive a check—I squire her to an
assembly, where I am blest with a sight of
my dear Narcissa, which discomposes me so
much, that Miss Snapper observing my disorder,
is at pains to discover the cause— 
is picqued at the occasion, and in our way
home, pays me a sarcastic compliment— 
I am met by Miss Williams, who is maid
and confidante of Narcissa—she acquaints
me with her lady's regard for me while
under the disguise of a servant, and describes
the transports of Narcissa on seeing me at
the assembly, in the character of a gentleman
—I am surprized with an account
of her aunt's marriage, and make an appointment
to meet Miss Williams next day. 
During this unsocial interval, my pride
and interest maintained a severe conflict, 

on the subject of Miss Snaper, whom the one
represented as unworthy of my notice, and the
other proposed as the object of my whole attention: 
The advantages and disadvantages attending
such a match, were opposed to one another
by my imagination; and at length, my
judgment gave it so much in favour of the first,
that I resolved to prosecute my scheme, with all
the address in my power. —I thought I perceived
some concern in her countenance, occasioned by
my silence, which she no doubt imputed to my
disgust at her mother's behaviour; and as I believed
the old woman could not fail of ascribing
my muteness to the same motive, I determined
to continue that sullen conduct towards her, and
fall upon some other method of manifesting my
esteem for the daughter; nor was it difficult for me
to make her acquainted with my sentiments by the
expression of my looks, which I modelled into
the characters of humility and love; and which
were answered by her with all the sympathy and
approbation I could desire. But when I began
to consider, that without further opportunities of
improving my success, all the progress I had hitherto
made could not much avail, and that such
opportunities could not be enjoyed without the
mother's permission; I concluded it would be requisite
to vanquish her coldness and suspicion by
my assiduities and respectful behaviour on the
road; and she would in all likelihood invite me
to visit her at Bath, where I did not fear of being
able to cultivate her acquaintance as much as would
be necessary to the accomplishment of my purpose. 
—And indeed accident furnished me with an
opportunity of obliging her so much, that she 

could not with any appearance of good manners,
forbear to gratify my inclination. 
When we arrived at our dining-place, we
found all the eatables in the inn bespoke by a
certain nobleman, who had got the start of us; 
and in all likelihood, my mistress and her mother
must have dined with Duke Humphrey, had I
not exerted myself in their behalf, and bribed
the landlord with a glass of wine to curtail his
lordship's entertainment of a couple of fowls and
some bacon, which I sent with my compliments
to the ladies; they accepted my treat with a great
many thanks, and desired I would favour them
with my company at dinner, where I amused the
old gentlewoman so successfully, by maintaining
a seemingly disinterested ease, in the midst of my
civility, that she signified a desire of being better
acquainted, and hoped I would be so kind as to
see her sometimes at Bath. —While I enjoyed
myself in this manner, the precise lady had the
good fortune to meet with her husband, who was
no other than gentleman, or in other words, valet
de chambre to the very nobleman, whose coach
stood at the door. Proud of the interest she had
in the house, she affected to shew her power by
introducing the captain to her spouse, as a person
who had treated her with great civility; upon which
he was invited to a share of their dinner; while
the poor lawyer, finding himself utterly abandoned,
made application to me, and was, through
my intercession, admitted into our company. — 
Having satisfied our appetites, and made ourselves
very merry at the expence of the person
of honour, the civil captain, and complaisant husband,
I did myself the pleasure of discharging
the bill by stealth, for which I received a great 

many apologies and acknowledgments from my
guests, and we reimbarked at the first warning. 
—The officer was obliged, at last, to appease his
hunger with a luncheon of bread and cheese,
and a pint bottle of brandy, which he dispatched
in the coach, cursing the inappetence of his lordship,
who had ordered dinner to be put back a
whole hour. 
Nothing remarkable happened during the remaining
part of our journey, which was ended
about twelve a-clock, when I waited on the ladies
to the house of a relation, in which they intended
to lodge, and passing that night at the inn,
took lodgings next morning for myself. 
The forenoon was spent in visiting every thing
that was worth seeing in the place, which I
did in company with a gentleman to whom
Banter had given me a letter of introduction; 
and in the afternoon I waited on the ladies, and
found Miss a good deal indisposed with the fatigues
of the journey. —As they foresaw they would
have occasion for a male acquaintance to squire
them at all publick places, I was received with
great cordiality, and had the mother's permission
to conduct them next day to the long room,
which we no sooner entered, than the eyes of
every body present were turned upon us; and
when we had suffered the martyrdom of their
looks for some time, a whisper circulated at our
expence, which was accompanied with many
contemptuous smiles, and tittering observations,
to my utter shame and confusion. —I did not so
much conduct as follow my charge to a place
where she seated her mother and herself with
astonishing composure, notwithstanding the unmannerly
behaviour of the whole company, 

which seemed to be assumed meerly to put her
out of countenance. —The celebrated Mr. N&wblank;h,
who commonly attends in this place, as master
of the ceremonies, perceiving the disposition of
the assembly, took upon himself the task of gratifying
their ill-nature still further, by exposing
my mistress to the edge of his wit. —With this
view he approached us, with many bows and grimaces,
and after having welcomed Miss Snapper
to the place, asked her, in the hearing of all
present, if she could inform him of the name of
Tobit's dog. —I was so much incensed at his insolence,
that I should certainly have kicked him
where he stood, without ceremony, had not the
young lady prevented the effects of my indignation,
by replying with the utmost vivacity,
“His name was N&wblank;sh, and an impudent dog
he was.” This repartee, so unexpected and
just, raised such an universal laugh at the aggressor,
that all his assurance was insufficient to support
him under their derision; so that after he
had endeavoured to compose himself, by taking
snuff, and forcing a smile, he was obliged to
sneak off in a very ludicrous attitude; while my
Dulcinea was applauded to the skies, for the
brilliancy of her wit, and her acquaintance immediately
courted by the best people of both sexes
in the room. —This event, with which I was infinitely
pleased at first, did not fail of alarming
me, upon further reflection, when I considered that
the more she was caressed by persons of distinction,
the more her pride would be inflamed, and
consequently, the obstacles to my success multiplied
and enlarged. —Nor were my presaging
fears untrue—That very night I perceived her a
little intoxicated with the incense she had received, 

and though she still behaved with a particular
civility to me, I foresaw that as soon
as her fortune should be known, she would
be surrounded with a swarm of admirers, some
one of whom might possibly, by excelling me
in point of wealth, or in the arts of flattery and
scandal, supplant me in her esteem, and find
means to make the mother of his party. —I resolved
therefore to lose no time, and being invited
to spend the evening with them, found an
opportunity, in spite of the old gentlewoman's vigilance,
to explain the meaning of my glances in
the coach, by paying homage to her wit, and
professing myself enamoured of her person. — 
She blushed at my declaration, and in a favourable
manner disapproved of the liberty I had taken,
putting me in mind of our being strangers to one
another, and desiring I would not be the means
of interrupting our acquaintance, by any such
unseasonable strokes of gallantry for the future. — 
My ardour was effectually checked by this reprimand,
which was, however, delivered in such a
gentle manner, that I had no cause to be disobliged; 
and the arrival of her mother relieved
me from a dilemma in which I should not have
known how to demean myself a minute longer. 
—Neither could I resume the easiness of carriage
with which I came in, my mistress acted on the
reserve, and the conversation beginning to flag,
the old lady introduced her kinswoman of the
house, and proposed a hand at whist. 
While we amused ourselves at this diversion, I
understood from the gentlewoman, that there was
to be an assembly next night, at which I begged to
have the honour of dancing with Miss. She thanked
me for the favour I intended her, assured me, she 

never did dance, but signified a desire of seeing
the company; upon which I offered my service,
and was accepted; not a little proud of being
exempted from appearing with her, in a situation,
that, notwithstanding my profession to the contrary,
was not at all agreeable to my inclination. 
Having supped, and continued the game, till
such time as the successive yawns of the mother
warned me to begone, I took my leave, and
went home, where I made Strap very happy
with an account of my progress. —Next day I
put on my gayest apparel, and went to drink tea
at Mrs. Snapper's, according to appointment,
when I found, to my inexpressible satisfaction, that
she was laid up with the tooth-ach, and that
Miss was to be intrusted to my care. —Accordingly,
we set out for the ball-room, pretty early
in the evening, and took possession of a commedious
place, where we had not sat longer than a
quarter of an hour, when a gentleman dressed in
a green frock came in, leading a young lady,
whom I immediately discovered to be the adorable
Narcissa! Good heaven! what were the thrillings
of my soul at that instant! my reflection was
overwhelmed with a torrent of agitation! my
heart throbbed with surprizing violence! a sudden
mist overspread my eyes! my ears were invaded
with a dreadful sound! I panted for want of
breath, and in short, was for some moments intranced! 
—This first tumult subsiding, a crowd of
flattering ideas rushed upon my imagination: 
Every thing that was soft, sensible, and engaging
in the character of that dear creature, recurred to
my remembrance, and every favourable circumstance
of my own qualifications appeared in all 

the aggravation of self-conceit, to heighten my
expectation! —Neither was this transport of
long duration: The dread of her being already
disposed of, intervened, and over-cast
my enchanting reverie! My presaging apprehension
represented her encircled in the arms of
some happy rival, and of consequence for ever
lost to me! I was stung with this suggestion,
and believing the person who conducted her, to
be the husband of this amiable young lady, already
devoted him to my fury, and stood up to
mark him for my vengeance; when I recollected,
to my unspeakable joy, her brother the fox-hunter,
in the person of her gallant. —Undeceived
so much to my satisfaction in this particular, I
gazed in a frenzy of delight, on the irresistible
charms of his sister, who no sooner distinguished
me in the crowd, than her evident confusion afforded
a happy omen to my flame. —At sight of
me she started, the roses instantly vanished from
her polished cheeks, and returned in a moment
with a double glow that over-spread her lovely
neck, while her enchanting bosom heaved with
strong emotion. —I hailed these favourable
symptoms, and lying in wait for her looks, I did
homage with my eyes. —She seemed to approve
my declaration, by the complacency of her aspect; 
and I was so transported with the discovery, that
more than once, I was on the point of making
up to her, and disclosing the throbbings of my
heart in person, had not that profound veneration
which her presence always inspired, restrained
the unseasonable impulse. —My whole
powers being engrossed in this manner, it may
be easily imagined how ill I entertained Miss
Snapper, on whom I could not now turn my 

eyes, without making comparisons very little to
her advantage. —It was not even in my power to
return distinct answers to the questions she asked
from time to time, so that she could not help
observing my absence of behaviour; and having a
turn, for observation, watched my glances, and
tracing them to the divine object, discovered the
cause of my disorder. —That she might, however,
be convinced of the truth of her conjecture, she
began to interrogate me with regard to Narcissa,
and notwithstanding all my endeavours to disguise
my sentiments, perceived my attachment by
my confusion. —Upon which, she assumed a stateliness
of behaviour, and sat silent during the remaining
part of the entertainment. —At any other
time I should have been prodigiously alarmed
at her suspicion, but at that instant, I was elevated
by my passion above every other consideration. 
—The mistress of my soul having retired
with her brother, I discovered so much uneasiness
at my situation, that Miss Snapper proposed
to go home; and while I conducted her to a
chair, told me she had too great a regard for me
to keep me any longer in torment. —I feigned
ignorance of her meaning, and having seen her
safely at her lodgings, took my leave, and went
home in an exstasy; where I disclosed every thing
that had happened to my confident and humble
servant Strap, who did not relish the accident so
well as I expected; and observed, that a bird in
hand is worth two in the bush. —“But however
(said he) you know best—you know best.” 
—Next day as I went to the Bath, in hopes of
seeing or hearing some tidings of my fair enslaver,
I was met by a gentlewoman, who having looked
hard at me, cried, “O Christ! Mr. Random!” 

Surprised at this exclamation, I examined the
countenance of the person who spoke, and immediately
recognized my old sweet-heart and
fellow-sufferer Miss Williams. 
I was mightily pleased to find this unfortunate
woman under such a decent appearance, professed
my joy at seeing her well, and desired to know
where I should have the pleasure of her conversation. 
She was as heartily rejoiced at the apparent
easiness of my fortune, and gave me to
know that she, as yet, had no habitation that she
could properly call her own; but would wait on
me at any place I would please to appoint—Understanding
that she was disengaged for the present,
I shewed her the way to my own lodgings, where,
after a very affectionate salutation, she informed
me of her being very happy in the service of a
young lady, to whom she was recommended by
a former mistress deceased, into whose family she
had introduced herself by the honest deceit she
had concerted, while she lived with me in the
garret at London—She then expressed a vehement
desire to be acquainted with the vicissitudes of my
life since we parted, and ascribed her curiosity to
the concern she had for my interest—I forthwith
gratified her request, and when I described
my situation in Sussex, perceived her to attend to
my story with particular eagerness. She interrupted
me when I had finished that period, with “good
God! is it possible,”—and then begged I would
be so good as to continue my relation; which I
did as briefly as I could, burning with impatience
to know the cause of her surprize, about which I
had already formed a very interesting conjecture— 
Having therefore brought my adventures down to
the present day, she seemed very much affected with 

the different circumstances of my fortune; and
saying with a smile, she believed my distresses were
now at a period, proceeded to inform me, that
the lady whom she served was no other than the
charming Narcissa, who had honoured her with
her confidence for some time,—that in consequence
of that trust, she had often repeated the
story of John Brown, with great admiration and
regard; that she loved to dwell upon the particulars
of his character, and did not scruple to own
a tender approbation of his flame—I became delirious
with this piece of intelligence, strained
Miss Williams in my embrace, called her the
angel of my happiness, and acted such extravagancies,
that she would have been convinced of
my sincerity, had not my honour been clear
enough to her before—As soon as I was in a condition
to yield attention, she described the present
situation of her mistress, who had no sooner come
home the night before, than she closeted her,
and in a rapture of joy, gave her to know that
she had seen me at the ball, where I appeared in
the character which she always thought my due,
with such advantage of transformation, that unless
my image had been engraven on her heart, it
would have been impossible to know me for the
person who had worn her aunt's livery;—that by
the language of my eyes, she was assured of the
continuance of my passion for her, and consequently
of my being unengaged to any other; 
and that though she did not doubt, I would
speedily fall upon some method of being introduced,
she was so impatient to hear of me, that
she (Miss Williams) had been sent abroad this
very morning, on purpose to learn tidings of the
name and character I at present bore. —My bosom 

had been hitherto a stranger to such a flood of joy
as now rushed upon it: My faculties were overborn
by the tide: It was some time, before I
could open my mouth; and much longer 'ere I
could utter a coherent sentence—At length, I fervently
requested her to lead me immediately to
the object of my adoration: but she resisted my
importunity, and explained the danger of such
premature conduct—“How favourable soever
(said she) my lady's inclination towards you
may be, this you may depend upon, that she
will not commit the smallest trespass on decorum,
either in disclosing her own, or in receiving
a declaration of your passion: and altho'
the great veneration I have for you, has
prompted me to reveal what she communicated
to me in confidence, I know so well the severity
of her sentiments with respect to the
punctilios of her sex, that, if she should learn
the least surmise of it, she would not only
dismiss me as a wretch unworthy of her benevolence,
but also for ever shun the efforts of
your love”—I assented to the justness of her
remonstrance, and desired she would assist me with
her advice and direction: upon which, it was
concerted between us, that for the present, I
should be contented with her telling Narcissa that
in the course of her inquiries, she could only learn
my name: and that if in a day or two, I could
fall upon no other method of being made acquainted,
she would deliver a letter from me,
on pretence of consulting her happiness; and say
that I met her in the streets, and bribed her to that
piece of service. —Matters being thus adjusted, I
kept my old acquaintance to breakfast, and learned 

from her conversation, that my rival Sir Timothy
had drunk himself into an apoplexy, of which he
died five months ago, that the savage was still unmarried,
and that his aunt had been seized with
a whim which he little expected, and chosen
the school-master of the parish for her lord and
husband: but matrimony not agreeing with her
constitution, she had been hectick and dropsical a
good while, and was now at Bath in order to
drink the waters for the recovery of her health; 
that her niece had accompanied her thither at her
request, and attended her with the same affection
as before, notwithstanding the faux pas she had
committed: and that her nephew who had been
exasperated at the loss of her fortune, did not
give his attendance out of good will, but purely
to have an eye on his sister, lest she should likewise
throw herself away, without his consent or
approbation. —Having enjoyed ourselves in this
manner, and made an assignation to meet next
day at a certain place, Miss Williams took
her leave; and Strap's looks being very inquisitive
about the nature of the communication subsisting
between us, I made him acquainted with the whole
affair, to his great astonishment and satisfaction.
