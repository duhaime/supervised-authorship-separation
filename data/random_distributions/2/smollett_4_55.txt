I cultivate an acquaintance with two noblemen
—am introduced to Earl Strutwell
—his kind promise and invitation— 
the behaviour of his porter and lacquey— 
he receives me with an appearance of uncommon
affection—undertakes to speak in my
behalf to the minister—informs me of his
success, and wishes me joy—introduces a
conversation about Petronius Arbiter— 
falls in love with my watch, which I press
upon him—I make a present of a diamond
ring to lord Straddle—impart my good
fortune to Strap and Banter, who dissabuses
me, to my utter mortification. 
Baffled hitherto in my matrimonial
schemes, I began to question my talents for
the science of fortune-hunting, and to bend
my thoughts towards some employment under
the government. —With the view of procuring
which, I cultivated the acquaintance of Lords 

Straddle and Swillpot, whose fathers were men of
interest at court. —I found these young noblemen as
open to my advances as I could desire: I accompanied
them in their midnight rambles, and often
dined with them at taverns, where I had the honour
of paying the reckoning. 
I one day took the opportunity, while I was
loaded with protestations of friendship, to disclose
my desire of being settled in some sine-cure; 
and to solicit their influence in my behalf. — 
Swillpot squeezing my hand, said, I might depend
upon his service, by G&sblank;d. The other swore
that no man would be more proud than he to
run my errands. Encouraged by these declarations
I ventured to express an inclination to be
introduced to their fathers, who were able to do
my business at once. Swillpot frankly owned he
had not spoke to his father these three years; 
and Straddle assured me his father having lately
disobliged the Minister by subscribing his name to
a protest in the house of peers, was thereby rendered
incapable of serving his friends at present; 
but he undertook to make me acquainted with
Earl Strutwell, who was hand and glove with a
certain person that ruled the roast. This offer I
embraced with many acknowledgments, and plied
him so closely, in spite of a thousand evasions, that
he found himself under a necessity of keeping his
word, and actually carried me to the levee of
this great man, where he left me in a crowd of
fellow-dependants, and was ushered to a particular
closet audience; from whence in a few minutes,
he returned with his lordship, who took
me by the hand, assured me he would do me all
the service he could, and desired to see me often. 
—I was charmed with my reception, and although 

I had heard that a courtier's promise is
not to be depended upon, I thought I discovered
so much sweetness of temper and candour in this
Earl's countenance, that I did not doubt of profiting
by his protection. —I resolved therefore, to
avail myself of his permission, and waited on
him next audience day, when I was favoured with
a particular smile, squeeze of the hand, and a whisper,
signifying that he wanted half an hour's conversation
with me tête a tête, when he should be
disengaged, and for that purpose desired me to
come and drink a dish of chocolate with him tomorrow
morning. —This invitation, which did
not a little flatter my vanity and expectation, I
took care to observe, and went to his lordship's
house at the time appointed. Having rapped at the
gate, the porter unbolted and kept it half open,
placing himself in the gap, like soldiers in a breach,
to dispute my passage. —I demanded to know if
his lord was stirring? —He answered with a surly
aspect, “No.” —“At what hour does he
commonly rise? (said I)”—“Sometimes
sooner, sometimes later (said he, closing the
door upon me by degrees.)” —I then told
him I was come by his lordship's own appointment; 
to which this Cerberus replied, “I
have received no orders about the matter;” 
and was upon the point of shutting me out,
when I recollected myself all of a sudden, and
slipping a crown into his hand, begged as a favour
that he would enquire and let me know whether
or not the Earl was up. The grim janitor relented
at the touch of my money, which he took
with all the indifference of a tax-gatherer, and
shewed me into a parlour, where, he said, I
might amuse myself till such time as his lord 

should be awake. —I had not sat ten minutes in
this place, when a footman entered, and without
speaking, stared at me; I interpreted this piece
of his behaviour into “Pray, Sir, what is your
business?” and asked the same question I had
put to the porter, when I accosted him first. The lacquey
made the same reply, and disappeared before I
could get any further intelligence. —In a little
time he returned, on pretence of poking the fire,
and looked at me again with great earnestness; 
upon which I began to perceive his meaning, and
tipping him with half a crown, desired he would be
so good as to fall upon some method of letting
the Earl know that I was in the house. —He made
a low bow, said, “Yes, Sir,” and vanished. — 
This bounty was not thrown away, for in an
instant he came back, and conducted me to a
chamber, where I was received with great kindness
and familiarity by his lordship, whom I found
just risen, in his morning gown and slippers. — 
After breakfast, he entered into a particular conversation
with me about my travels, the remarks
I had made abroad, and examined me to the full
extent of my understanding. —My answers seemed
to please him very much, he frequently squeezed
my hand, and looking at me with a singular complacency
in his countenance, bid me depend upon
his good offices with the ministry in my behalf. 
“Young men of your qualifications (said
he) ought to be cherished by every administration
—For my own part, I see so little merit
in the world, that I have laid it down as a
maxim, to encourage the least appearance of
genius and virtue, to the utmost of my
power—You have a great deal of both; and
will not fail of making a figure one day, if I 

am not mistaken; but you must lay your account
with mounting by gradual steps to the
summit of your fortune. —Rome was not
built in a day. —As you understand the languages
perfectly well, how would you like to
cross the sea, as secretary to an embassy?” 
—I assured his lordship, with great eagerness, that
nothing could be more agreeable to my inclination: 
Upon which he bid me make myself easy, my business
was done, for he had a place of that kind
in his view. —This piece of generosity affected me
so much, that I was unable for some time to express
my gratitude, which at length broke out in
acknowledgments of my own unworthiness, and
encomiums on his benevolence. —I could not even
help shedding tears, at the goodness of this noble
lord, who no sooner perceived them, than he
caught me in his arms, hugged and kissed me
with a seemingly paternal affection. —Confounded
at this uncommon instance of fondness for a
stranger, I remained a few moments silent and
ashamed, then got up and took my leave, after
he had assured me that he would speak to the
Minister in my favour, that very day; and desired
that I would not for the future give myself the
trouble of attending at his levée, but come at
the same hour every day, when he was at leisure,
which was three times a week. 
Though my hopes were now very sanguine,
I determined to conceal my prospect from
every body, even from Strap, until I should be
more certain of success; and in the mean time,
give my patron no respite from my sollicitations. 
—When I renewed my visit, I found the three
door opened to me as if by enchantment; but
in my passage towards the presence-room, I was 

met by the valet de chambre, who cast some furious
looks at me, the meaning of which I could
not comprehend. The Earl saluted me at entrance
with a tender embrace, and wished me joy
of his success with the Premier, who, he said, had
preferred his recommendation to that of two other
noblemen very urgent in behalf of their respective
friends, and absolutely promised that I should go
to a certain foreign court in quality of secretary to
an embassador and plenipotentiary, who would
set out in a few weeks, on an affair of vast importance
to the nation. I was thunder-struck
with my good fortune, and could make no other
reply, than kneel and attempt to kiss my
benefactor's hand, which he would not permit,
but raising me up, pressed me to his breast with
surprizing emotion, and told me he had now taken
upon himself the care of making my fortune. — 
What inhanced the value of the benefit still the
more, was his making light of the favour, and
shifting the conversation to another subject: 
Among other topicks of discourse, that of the
Belle Lettre was introduced, upon which his lordship
held forth with great taste and erudition,
and discovered an intimate knowledge of the
authors of antiquity. —“Here's a book (said he,
taking one from his bosom) written with
great elegance and spirit, and though the subject
may give offence to some narrow-minded
people, the author will always be held in esteem
by every person of sense and learning.” 
So saying, he put into my hand Petronius Arbiter,
and asked my opinion of his wit and manner. —I
told him, that in my opinion, he wrote with great ease
and vivacity, but was withal so lewd and indecent,
that he ought to find no quarter or protection 

among people of morals and taste. —“I own (replied
the Earl) that his taste in love is generally
decried, and indeed condemned by our
laws; but perhaps that may be more owing
to prejudice and misapprehension, than to true
reason and deliberation. —The best man among
the ancients is said to have entertained
that passion; one of the wisest of their legislators
has permitted the indulgence of it in
his commonwealth; the most celebrated poets
have not scrupled to avow it at this day; it
prevails not only over all the east, but in most
parts of Europe; in our own country it gains
ground apace, and in all probability will become
in a short time a more fashionable vice than
simple fornication. —Indeed there is something
to be said in vindication of it, for notwithstanding
the severity of the law against offenders
in this way, it must be confessed that the practice
of this passion is unattended with that
curse and burthen upon society, which proceeds
from a race of miserable deserted bastards,
who are either murdered by their parents, deserted
to the utmost want and wretchedness,
or bred up to prey upon the commonwealth: 
And it likewise prevents the debauchery of
many a young maiden, and the prostitution of
honest men's wives; not to mention the consideration
of health, which is much less liable
to be impaired in the gratification of this appetite,
than in the exercise of common venery,
which by ruining the constitutions of our young
men, has produced a puny progeny that degenerates
from generation to generation: Nay,
I have been told, that there is another motive
perhaps more powerful than all these, 

that induces people to cultivate this inclination; 
namely, the exquisite pleasure attending
its success.” 
From this discourse, I began to be apprehensive
that his lordship finding I had travelled, was afraid
I might have been infected with this spurious and
sordid desire abroad, and took this method of
sounding my sentiments on the subject. —Fired at
this supposed suspicion, I argued against it with
great warmth, as an appetite unnatural, absurd,
and of pernicious consequence; and declared my
utter detestation and abhorrence of it in these
lines of the satyrist. 

“Eternal infamy the wretch confound
“Who planted first, this vice on British ground!
“A vice! that 'spite of sense and nature reigns,
“And poisons genial love, and manhood stains!”
The Earl smiled at my indignation, told me
he was glad to find my opinion of the matter
so conformable to his own, and that what he had
advanced was only to provoke me to an answer,
with which he professed himself perfectly well
pleased. 
After I had enjoyed a long audience, I happened
to look at my watch, in order to regulate
my motions by it; and his lordship observing
the chased case, desired to see the device, and
examine the execution, which he approved with
some expressions of admiration. —Considering the
obligations I lay under to his lordship, I thought
there could not be a fitter opportunity than the
present to manifest, in some shape, my gratitude; 

I therefore begged he would do me the honour
to accept of the watch as a small testimony of
the sense I had of his lordship's generosity; 
but he refused it in a peremptory manner, and
said he was sorry I should entertain such a mercenary
opinion of him, observing at the same
time, that it was the most beautiful piece of
workmanship he had ever seen; and desiring
to know where he could have such another. —I
begged a thousand pardons for the freedom I
had taken, which I hoped he would impute to
nothing else than the highest veneration for his
person—let him know that as it came to my hand
by accident in France, I could give him no information
about the maker, for there was no name
on the inside; and once more humbly entreated
that he would indulge me so far as to use it for
my sake. —He was still positive in refusing it; 
but was pleased to thank me for my generous offer,
saying, it was a present that no nobleman needed
be ashamed of receiving; though he was resolved
to shew his disinterestedness with regard to me, for
whom he had conceived a particular friendship; 
and insisted (if I was willing to part with the
watch) upon knowing what it cost, that he
might at least indemnify me, by refunding the
money. On the other hand, I assured his lordship,
that I would look upon it as an uncommon
mark of distinction, if he would take it without
further question; and rather than disoblige
me, he was at last persuaded to put it in his pocket,
to my no small satisfaction, who took my leave
immediately, after having received a kind squeeze,
and an injunction to depend upon his promise. 
Buoyed up with my reception, my heart opened,
I gave away a guinea among the lacqueys, who 

escorted me to the door, flew to the lodgings
of Lord Straddle, upon whom I forced my diamond
ring, as an acknowledgment for the great
service he had done me, and from thence hied
myself home, with an intent of sharing my happiness
with honest Strap. —I determined, however,
to heighten his pleasure by depressing his
spirits at first, and then bringing in the good
news with double relish. —For this purpose, I affected
the appearance of disappointment and
chagrin, and told him in an abrupt manner,
that I had lost the watch and diamond. Poor
Hugh, who had been already harrassed into a consumption
by intelligence of this sort, no sooner
heard these words, than, unable to contain himself,
he cried with distraction in his looks,
“God in heaven forbid!” —I could carry on
the farce no longer, but laughing in his face,
told him every thing that had befallen, as above
recited. His features were immediately unbended,
and the transition so affecting, that he wept
with joy, calling my Lord Strutwell by the appellations
of Jewel, Phœnix, Rara avis, and
praising God, that there was still some virtue
left among our nobility. —Our mutual
congratulations being over, we gave way
to our imagination, and anticipated our happiness
by prosecuting my success through the different
steps of promotion, till I arrived at the
rank of a prime minister, and he to that of my
first secretary. 
Intoxicated with these ideas I went to the
ordinary, where, meeting with Banter, I communicated
the whole affair in confidence to him,
concluding with an assurance that I would do 

him all the service in my power. —He heard
me to an end with great patience, then regarding
me a good while with a look of disdain, pronounced, 
“So, your business is done, you
think?” —“As good as done, I believe,
(said I.)” —“I'll tell you (replied he)
what will do it still more effectually—A
halter—'Sdeath! if I had been such a gull to
two such scoundrels as Strutwell and Straddle, I
would without any more ado tuck myself up.” 
Shocked at this exclamation, I desired him with
some confusion to explain himself: Upon which
he gave me to understand, that Straddle was a
poor contemptible wretch, who lived by borrowing
and pimping to his fellow peers; that in
consequence of this last capacity, he had, doubtless,
introduced me to Strutwell, who was so notorious
for a passion for his own sex, that he was
amazed his character had never reached my ears; 
and that so far from being able to obtain for
me the post he had promised, his interest at
court was so low, that he could scarce provide
for a superannuated footman once a year, in
Chelsea-hospital;—that it was a common
thing for him to amuse strangers whom his
jack-calls run down, with such assurances and
caresses as he had bestowed on me, until he had
stript them of their cash and every thing valuable
about them;—very often of their chastity, and then
leave them a prey to want and infamy;—that he
allowed his servants no other wages than that part
of the spoil which they could glean by their industry; 
and that the whole of his conduct towards
me was so glaring, that no body who
knew any thing of mankind could have been
imposed upon by his insinuations. 

I leave the reader to judge how I relished this
piece of information, which precipitated me from
the most exalted pinnacle of hope to the lowest
abyss of despondence; and well nigh determined
me to take Banter's advice, and finish my
chagrin with a halter. —I had no room to suspect
the veracity of my friend, because upon recollection,
I found every circumstance of Strutwell's
behaviour, exactly tallying with the
character he had described: His hugs, embraces,
squeezes and eager looks, were now no longer a
mystery; no more than his defence of Petronius,
and the jealous frown of his valet de chambre,
who, it seems, was at present the favourite
pathic of his lord.
