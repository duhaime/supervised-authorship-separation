Sir Charles Grandison, To Miss Jervois. 


Sunday, Nov. 12.
It would give me great pain to deny to my good
Miss Jervois the grant of any request she shall
think fit to make to me. You shall know, you say,
by the grant of this favour, that I have quite forgiven
my ward. Was such a test wanted, my dear? I
assure you, that what you have lately done for your
mother, tho' I was not consulted in it, has heightened
my opinion of the worthiness of your heart. 
As to your request, I have pleasure in leaving everything
relating to the happy event to my beloved Miss
Byron and her friends. I will entreat her to underwrite
her mind on this subject. She grieves that the
solemnity cannot be private; which, beloved as she is
in this neighbourhood, would be vain to attempt. 
If her aunt has no objection from want of room,
there cannot, my dear Emily, be any from 
Your affectionate and true Friend,
Ch. Grandison. 



Underwritten.
My dearest Miss Jervois will excuse me, that I gave
her not a formal invitation, when I intimated my
wishes for Lady G's presence on the approaching solemn
occasion, tho' at so many miles distance. It is
a very solemn one. One's heart, my dear, cannot be
so much disengaged, as to attend to invitations for the
very Day, as it might on its anniversary. We shall
have too great a number of friends. O my dear!
can you bear to make one in so large a company? I
shall not be able to attend to any of my friends on the
Day: No, not to you, my Love. Can you bear with
my inattention to every-body, to every subject, but
one? Can you desire to see your Harriet (joyful as
the occasion is, and the chosen wish of her heart)
look and behave like a foolish creature? If you can,
and Lady G. will take charge of my lovely young
friend, all mine will rejoice in being able to contribute
to your pleasure, as well as 
Your ever-affectionate
Harriet Byron.
