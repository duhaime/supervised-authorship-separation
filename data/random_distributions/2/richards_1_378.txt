Mr. Belford, To Robert Lovelace, Esq; 

Thursday, July 27. 
I went this morning, according to the Lady's invitation,
to breakfast, and found Mr. Hickman
with her. 
A good deal of heaviness and concern hung upon
his countenance; but he received me with more respect
than he did yesterday; which, I presume, was
owing to the Lady's favourable character of me. 

He spoke very little; for I suppose they had all their
talk out yesterday and before I came this morning. 
By the hints that dropt, I perceived that Miss
Howe's Letter gave an account of your interview with
her at Col. Ambrose's—of your professions to Miss
Howe; and Miss Howe's opinion, that marrying you
was the only way now left to repair her wrongs. 
Mr. Hickman, as I also gathered, had pressed her,
in Miss Howe's name, to let her, on her return from
the Isle of Wight, find her at a neighbouring farmhouse,
where neat apartments would be made ready
to receive her. She asked, How long it would be
before they returned? And he told her, It was proposed
to be no more than a fortnight out and in. 
Upon which, she said, She should then perhaps have
time to consider of that kind proposal. 
He had tendered her money from Miss Howe; but
could not induce her to take any. No wonder I was
refused! She only said, That, if she had occasion, she
would be obliged to nobody but Miss Howe. 
Mr. Goddard her Apothecary came in before breakfast
was over. At her desire he sat down with us. 
Mr. Hickman asked him, If he could give him any
consolation in relation to Miss Harlowe's recovery, to
carry down to a friend who loved her as she loved
her own life? 
The Lady, said he, will do very well, if she will
resolve upon it herself. Indeed you will, Madam. 
The Doctor is entirely of this opinion; and has ordered
nothing for you, but weak jellies, and innocent
cordials, lest you should starve yourself. And let me
tell you, Madam, that so much watching, so little
nourishment, and so much grief, as you seem to indulge,
is enough to impair the most vigorous health,
and to wear out the strongest constitution. 
What, Sir, said she, can I do? I have no appetite. 
Nothing you call nourishing will stay on my
stomach. I do what I can: And have such kind directors 

in Dr. H. and you, that I should be inexcuseable
if I did not. 
I'll give you a Regimen, Madam, replied he; 
which, I am sure, the Doctor will approve of, and
will make physic unnecessary in your case. And that
is, ‘Go to rest at Ten at night. Rise not till Seven
in the morning. Let your breakfast be water-gruel,
or milk-pottage, or weak broths: Your dinner anything
you like, so you will but eat: A dish of tea,
with milk, in the afternoon; and sagoe for your
supper: And, my life for yours, this diet, and a
month's country-air, will set you up.’ 
We were much pleased with the worthy gentleman's
disinterested Regimen: And she said, referring
to her Nurse (who vouched for her) Pray, Mr. Hickman,
let Miss Howe know the good hands I am in: 
And as to the kind charge of the gentleman, assure her,
that all I promised to her, in the longest of my two
last Letters, on the subject of my health, I do and
will, to the utmost of my power, observe. I have
engaged, Sir [to Mr. Goddard] I have engaged, Sir
[to me] to Miss Howe, to avoid all wilful neglects. 
It would be an unpardonable fault, and very ill become
the character I would be glad to deserve, or the
temper of mind I wish my friends hereafter to think
me mistress of, if I did not. 
Mr. Hickman and I went afterwards to a neighbouring
Coffee-house; and he gave me some account
of your behaviour at the Ball on Monday night, and
of your treatment of him in the conference he had
with you before that; which he represented in a more
favourable light than you had done yourself: And yet
he gave his sentiments of you with great freedom,
but with the politeness of a gentleman. 
He told me how very determined the Lady was
against marrying you; that she had, early this morning,
set herself to write a Letter to Miss Howe, in
answer to one he brought her, which he was to call 

for at twelve, it being almost finished before he saw
her at breakfast; and that at three he proposed to set
out on his return. 
He told me, that Miss Howe and her Mother, and
himself, were to begin their little journey for the Isle
of Wight on Monday next: But that he must make
the most favourable representation of Miss Harlowe's
bad health, or they should have a very uneasy absence. 
He expressed the pleasure he had in finding the Lady
in such good Hands. He proposed to call on Dr.
H. to take his opinion whether it were likely she
would recover; and hoped he should find it favourable. 
As he was resolved to make the best of the matter,
and as the Lady had refused to accept of money offered
by Mr. Hickman, I said nothing of her parting with
her cloaths. I thought it would serve no other end
to mention it, but to shock Miss Howe: For it has
such a sound with it, that a woman of her rank and
fortune should be so reduced, that I cannot myself
think of it with patience; nor know I but one man
in the world who can. 
This gentleman is a little finical and formal. Modest
or diffident men wear not soon off those little Precisenesses,
which the confident, if ever they had them,
presently get above. And why? Because they are too
confident to doubt any-thing. But I think Mr. Hickman
is an agreeable sensible man, and not at all deserving
of the treatment or the character you give
him. 
But you are really a strange mortal: Because you
have advantages in your person, in your air, and intellect,
above all the men I know, and a face that
would deceive the devil, you can't think any man else
tolerable. 
It is upon this modest principle that thou deridest
some of us, who, not having thy confidence in their
outside appearance, seek to hide their defects by the 

Taylor's and Peruke-maker's assistance [Mistakenly
enough, if it be really done so absurdly as to expose
them more]; and sayst, That we do but hang out a
Sign, in our dress, of what we have in the Shop of
our Minds. This, no doubt, thou thinkest, is smartly
observed: But pr'ythee, Lovelace, tell me, if thou
canst, What sort of a Sign must thou hang out, wert
thou obliged to give us a clear idea by it of the furniture
of thy mind? 
Mr. Hickman tells me, He should have been happy
with Miss Howe some weeks ago (for all the settlements
have been some time engrossed); but that she
will not marry, she declares, while her dear friend is
so unhappy. 
This is truly a charming instance of the force of female
friendship; which you and I, and our brother
Rakes, have constantly ridiculed as a chimerical thing
in women of equal age, rank, and perfections. 
But really, Lovelace, I see more and more, that
there are not in the world, with all our conceited
pride, narrower-souled wretches than we Rakes and
Libertines are. And I'll tell thee how it comes about. 
Our early Love of Roguery makes us generally run
away from instruction; and so we become mere
Smatterers in the Sciences we are put to learn; and,
because we will know no more, think there is no
more to be known. 
With an infinite deal of vanity, un-reined imaginations,
and no judgments at all, we next commence
half-wits, and then think we have the whole field of
knowlege in possession, and despise every one who
takes more pains, and is more serious, than ourselves,
as phlegmatic stupid fellows, who have no taste for
the most poignant pleasures of life. 
This makes us insufferable to men of modesty and
merit, and obliges us to herd with those of our own
cast; and by this means we have no opportunities of
seeing or conversing with any-body who could or 

would shew us what we are; and so we conclude,
that we are the cleverest fellows in the world, and
the only men of spirit in it; and, looking down with
supercilious eyes on all who give not themselves the
liberties we take, imagine the world made for us, and
for us only. 
Thus, as to useful knowlege, while others go to
the bottom, we only skim the surface; are despised
by people of solid sense, of true honour, and superior
talents; and, shutting our eyes, move round and
round (like so many blind mill-horses) in one narrow
circle, while we imagine we have all the world to
range in.

I threw myself in Mr. Hickman's way, on his
return from the Lady. 
He was excessively moved at taking leave of her; 
being afraid, as he said to me (tho' he would not tell
her so) that he should never see her again. She charged
him to represent every-thing to Miss Howe in the most
favourable light that the truth would bear. 
He told me of a tender passage at parting; which
was, that having saluted her at her closet-door, he
could not help once more taking the same liberty, in
a more fervent manner, at the stairs-head, whither
she accompanied him; and this in the thought, that
it was the last time he should ever have that honour; 
and offering to apologize for his freedom (for
he had pressed her to his heart with a vehemence, that
he could neither account for or resist)—“Excuse you,
Mr. Hickman! that I will: You are my Brother
and my Friend: And to shew you, that the good
man, who is to be happy with my beloved Miss
Howe, is very dear to me, you shall carry to her
this token of my Love”—[offering her sweet face
to his salute, and pressing his hand between hers]: 
“And perhaps her Love of me will make it more
agreeable to her, than her punctilio would otherwise 

allow it to be: And tell her, said she, dropping on
one knee, with clasped hands, and uplifted eyes,
that in this posture you see me, in the last moment
of our parting, begging a blessing upon you
both, and that you may be the delight and comfort
of each other, for many, very many, happy
years!” 
Tears, said he, fell from my eyes: I even sobbed
with mingled joy and sorrow; and she retreating as
soon as I raised her, I went down stairs, highly dissatisfied
with myself for going; yet unable to stay; 
my eyes fixed the contrary way to my feet, as long as
I could behold the skirts of her raiment. 
I went into the back-shop, continued the worthy
man, and recommended the angelic Lady to the best
care of Mrs. Smith; and, when I was in the street,
cast my eye up at her window: There, for the last
time, I doubt, said he, that I shall ever behold her,
I saw her; and she waved her charming hand to me,
and with such a look of smiling goodness, and mingled
concern, as I cannot describe. 
Pr'ythee tell me, thou vile Lovelace, if thou hast
not a notion even from these jejune descriptions of
mine, that there must be a more exalted pleasure in
intellectual friendship, than ever thou couldst taste in
the gross fumes of sensuality? And whether it may
not be possible for thee, in time, to give that preference
to the infinitely preferable, which I hope,
now, that I shall always give? 
I will leave thee to make the most of this reflection,
from 
Thy true Friend,
J. Belford.
