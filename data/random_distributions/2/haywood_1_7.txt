May be of some service to the ladies, especially the younger sort, if well attended to. 
Miss Betsy had now no person that professed
a serious passion for her; but
as she had yet never seen the man capable
of inspiring her with the least emotions of
tenderness, she was quite easy as to that
point, and wished nothing beyond what
she enjoyed, the pleasure of being told she
was very handsome, and gallanted about
by a great number of those, who go by
the name of very pretty fellows. Pleased
with the praise, she regarded not the condition
or merits of the praiser, and suffered
herself to be treated, presented,
and squir'd about to all public places,
either by the rake, the man of honour,
the wit, or the fool, the married, as well
as the unmarried, without distinction, and
just as either fell in her way. 
Such a conduct as this could not fail
of laying her open to the censure of malicious
tongues:—the agreeableness of
her person, her wit, and the many accomplishments 
she was mistress of, made
her envied and hated, even by those who
professed the greatest friendship for her. 
Several there were who, though they could
scarce support the vexation it gave them
to see her so much preferred to themselves,
yet chose to be as much with her as possible,
in the cruel hope of finding some
fresh matter wherewith to blast her reputation. 
Certain it is, that tho' she was as far
removed, as innocence itself, from all intent
or wish of committing a real ill, yet
she paid too little regard to the appearances
of it, and said and did many things,
which the actually criminal would be more
cautious to avoid. Hurried by an excess
of vanity, and that love of pleasure so natural
to youth, she indulged herself in liberties,
of which she foresaw not the consequences. 
Lady Trusty, who sincerely loved her,
both for her own sake, and that of her deceased
mother, came more often to mr.
Goodman's than otherwise she would
have done, on purpose to observe the behaviour
of miss Betsy: she had heard
some accounts, which gave her great dissatisfaction; 
but as she was a woman of
penetration, she easily perceived, that plain 
reproof was not the way to prevail on her
to reclaim the errors of her conduct;— 
that she must be insensibly weaned from
what, at present, she took so much delight
in, and brought into a different manher
of living, by ways which should rather
seem to flatter than check her vanity:
she therefore earnestly wished to get her
down with her into L&wblank;e, where
she was soon going herself; but knew not
how to ask her without making the same
invitation to miss Flora, whose company
she no way desired, and whose example
she was sensible had very much contributed
to give miss Betsy that air of levity,
which rendered her good sense almost useless
to her. 
This worthy lady happening to find her
alone one day, (a thing not very usual)
she asked, by way of sounding her inclination,
if she would not be glad to see
L&wblank;e again; to which she replied,
that there were many people for whom she
had a very great respect, but the journey
was too long to be taken merely on the
score of making a short visit; for she
owned she did not like the country well
enough to continue in it for any length of
time. 
Lady Trusty would fain have perswaded
her into a better opinion of the place she
was born in, and which most of her family
had passed the greatest part of their
lives in; but miss Betsy was not to be argued
into any tolerable ideas of it, and
plainly told her ladyship, that what she
called a happy tranquil manner of spending
ones days, seemed to her little better
than being buried alive. 
From declaring her aversion to a country
life, she ran into such extravagant encomiums
on those various amusements,
which London every day presented, that
lady Trusty perceived it would not be
without great difficulty she would be
brought to a more just way of thinking:
she concealed, however, as much as possible,
the concern it gave her to hear her
express herself in this manner, contenting
herself with saying, calmly, that London
was, indeed, a very agreeable place to live
in, especially for young people, and the
pleasures it afforded were very elegant; 
“but then” said she, “the too frequent
repetition of them, may so much engrols
the mind, as to take it off from
other objects, which ought to have their
share in it: besides,” continued she,
“there are but too frequent proofs, that 
an innate principle of virtue is not always
a sufficient guard against the many
snares laid for it, under the shew of innocent
pleasures, by wicked and designing
persons of both sexes; nor can it
be esteemed prudence to run ones self
into dangers meerly to shew our strength
in overcoming them; nor, perhaps,
would even the victory turn always to
our glory: the world is censorious,
and seldom ready to put the best construction
on things; so that reputation
may suffer, though virtue triumphs.” 
Miss Betsy listened to all this with a
good deal of attention. —The impudent
attempt Gayland had made on her, came
fresh into her mind, and made this lady's
remonstrances sink the deeper into it. 
The power of reflection being a little
awakened in her, some freedoms also, not
altogether consistent with strict modesty,
which others had offered to her, convinced
her of the error of maintaining too little
reserve; she thanked her kind adviser, and
promised to observe the precepts she had
given. 
Lady Trusty finding this good effect of
what she had said, ventured to proceed so
far, as to give some hints, that the conduct
of miss Flora had been far from 
blameless; and, therefore, pursued she, I
should be glad, methinks, to see you separated
from that young lady, though it were
but for a small time; and then gave her to
understand, how great a pleasure it would
be to her, to get her down with her to
L&wblank;e, if it could be any way contrived,
that she could go without miss
Flora. 
“As I have been so long from home,” 
said she, “I know I shall have all the
gentry round the country to welcome
me at my return, and if you should find
the company less polite, than those you
leave behind, it will, at least, diversify
the scene, and render the entertainments
of London new to you a second time,
when you come back.” 
Miss Betsy found in herself a strong inclination
to comply with this proposal, and
told lady Trusty, she should think herself
happy in passing the whole summer with
her; and as to miss Flora, the same offer
might be made to her, without any danger
of her accepting it. “I am not of your
opinion,” said the other; “the girl has
no fortune, but what mr. Goodman shall
be pleased to give her; which cannot
be very considerable, as he has a nephew
in the East-Indies, whom he is extremely 
fond of, and will make his heir. Lady
Mellasin would, therefore, catch at the
opportunity of sending her daughter to
a place where there are so many gentlemen
of estates, among whom she might
have a better chance for getting a husband,
than she can have in London,
where her character would scarce entitle
her to such a hope. I will however,” 
pursued she, “run the risque, and choose
rather to have a guest, whose company
I do not so well approve of, than be
deprived of one I so much value.” 
Miss Betsy testified the sense she had of
her ladyship's goodness, in the most grateful
and obliging terms, and lady Mellasin,
and miss Flora coming home soon after,
lady Trusty said, she was come on purpose
to ask permission for miss Flora and
miss Betsy to pass two or three months
with her, down in L&wblank;e. 
Lady Mellasin, as the other had imagined,
seemed extremely pleased with the
invitation, and told her, she did her daughter
a great deal of honour, and she would
take care things should be prepared for
both the young ladies to attend her, on her
setting out. Lady Trusty then told her,
she had fixed the day for it, which was
about a fortnight after this conversation, 
and some other matters relating to the
journey being regulated, took her leave,
highly pleased with the thoughts of getting
miss Betsy to a place, where she should
have an opportunity of using her utmost
endeavours to improve the good she found
in her disposition, and of weaning her, by
degrees, from any ill habits she might
have contracted in that Babel of mixed
company she was accustomed to at lady
Mellasin's.
