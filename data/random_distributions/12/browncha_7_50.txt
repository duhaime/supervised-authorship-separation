To M. Colden.
December 8.
SIR,






Inclosed is a letter which you may, if you
think proper, deliver to Mrs. Fielder. I am very
ill. Don't attempt to see me again. I cannot
be seen. Let the inclosed satisfy you. It
is enough. Never should I have said so much,
if I thought I were long for this world.
Let me not have a useless enemy in you. I
hope the fatal effects of my rashness have not
gone further than Mrs. Talbot's family. Let
the mischief be repaired, as far as it can be;
but do not injure me unnecessarily. I hope I
am understood.
Let me know what use you have made of the
letter you shewed me, and, I beseech you, return
it to me by the bearer.

M. Jessup.
