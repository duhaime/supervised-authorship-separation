She cannot, quoth my uncle Toby,
halting, when they had march'd up
to within twenty paces of Mrs. Wadman's
door—she cannot, Corporal, take
it amiss.— 
—She will take it, an' please your
honour, said the Corporal, just as the
Jew's widow at Lisbon took it of my
brother Tom.— 
—And how was that? quoth my
uncle Toby, facing quite about to the
Corporal. 
Your honour, replied the Corporal,
knows of Tom's misfortunes; but this 

affair has nothing to do with them any
further than this, That if Tom had
not married the widow—or had it
pleased God after their marriage, that
they had but put pork into their sausages,
the honest soul had never been taken
out of his warm bed, and dragg'd to
the inquisition—'Tis a cursed place— 
added the Corporal, shaking his head,
—when once a poor creature is in,
he is in, an' please your honour, for
ever. 
'Tis very true; said my uncle Toby
looking gravely at Mrs. Wadman's house,
as he spoke. 
Nothing, continued the Corporal, can
be so sad as confinement for life—or so
sweet, an' please your honour, as liberty. 

Nothing, Trim—said my uncle
Toby, musing— 
Whilst a man is free—cried the Corporal,
giving a flourish with his stick
thus— 


A thousand of my father's most subtle
syllogisms could not have said more for
celibacy. 
My uncle Toby look'd earnestly towards
his cottage and his bowling green. 
The Corporal had unwarily conjured
up the Spirit of calculation with his
wand; and he had nothing to do, but
to conjure him down again with his
story, and in this form of Exorcism,
most un-ecclesiastically did the Corporal
do it.
