DEAR LEWIS,
THAT part of Scotland contiguous to Berwick
nature seems to have intended as a barrier
between two hostile nations. It is a brown desert
of considerable extent, that produces nothing but
heath and fern; and what rendered it the more
dreary when we passed, there was a thick fog that
hindered us from seeing above twenty yards from
the carriage —My sister began to make wry faces,
and use her smelling-bottle; Liddy looked blank,
and Mrs. Jenkins dejected; but in a few hours these
clouds were dissipated; the sea appeared upon our
right and on the left the mountains retired a little,
leaving an agreeable plain betwixt them and
the beach; but, what surprised us all, this plain, to
the extent of several miles, was covered with as
fine wheat as ever I saw in the most fertile parts of
South Britain —This plentiful crop is raised in the
open field, without any inclosure, or other manure
than the alga marina, or sea-weed, which
abounds on this coast; a circumstance which shews
that the soil and climate are favourable; but that
agriculture in this country is not yet brought to
tha perfection which it has attained in England. 
Inclosures would not only keep the grounds warm,
and the several fields distinct, but would also protect
the crop from the high winds, which are so
frequent in this part of the island. 
Dunbar is well situated for trade, and has a curious
bason, where ships of small burden may be
perfectly secure; but there is little appearance of
business in the place —From thence, all the way
to Edinburgh, there is a continual succession of 

fine seats, belonging to noblemen and gentlemen; 
and as each is surrounded by its own parks and plantation,
they produce a very pleasing effect in a
country which lies otherwise open and exposed. 
At Dunbar there is a noble park, with a lodge, belonging
to the Duke of Roxburg, where Oliver
Cromwell had his head-quarters, when Lesley, at
the head of a Scotch army, took possession of the
mountains in the neighoourhood, and hampered
him in such a manner, that he would have been
obliged to embark and get away by sea, had not
the fanaticism of the enemy forfeited the advantage
which they had obtained by their general's conduct 
—Their ministers, by exhortation, prayer, assurance,
and prophecy, instigated them to go down
and slay the Philistines in Gilgal, and they quitted
their ground accordingly, notwithstanding all that
Lesley could do to restrain the madness of their
enthusiasm —When Oliver saw them in motion,
he exclaimed, “Praised be the Lord, he hath delivered
them into the hands of his servant!” and
ordered his troops to sing a psalm of thanksgiving,
while they advanced in order to the plain, where
the Scots were routed with great slaughter. 
In the neighbourhood of Haddington, there is
a gentleman's house, in the building of which,
and the improvements about, it, he is said to have
expended forty thousand pounds: but I cannot say
I was much pleased with either the architecture or
the situation; though it has in front a pastoral
stream, the banks of which are laid out in a very
agreeable manner. I intended to pay my respects
to lord Elibank, whom I had the honour to know
at London many years ago. He lives in this part
of Lothian; but was gone to the North, on a visit 
—You have often heard me mention this nobleman,
whom I have long revered for his humanity
and universal intelligence, over and above the entertainment 

arising from the originality of his character 
—At Musselburgh, however, I had the good
fortune to drink tea with my old friend Mr. Cardonel; 
and at his house I met with Dr. C&wblank;,
the parson of the parish, whose humour and conversation
inflamed me with a desire of being better
acquainted with his person —I am not at all surprised
that these Scots make their way in every
quarter of the globe. 
This place is but four miles from Edinburgh,
towards which we proceeded along the sea-shore,
upon a firm bottom of smooth sand, which the tide
had left uncovered in its retreat —Edinburgh, from
this avenue, is not seen to much advantage —We
had only an imperfect view of the castle and upper
parts of the town, which varied incessantly according
to the inflexions of the road, and exhibited
the appearance of detatched spires and turrets, belonging
to some magnificent edifice in ruins. The
palace of Holyrood-house stands on the left, as
you enter the Canongate —This is a street continued
from hence to the gate called Nether Bow,
which is now taken away; so that there is no interruption
for a long mile, from the bottom to the
top of the hill on which the Castle stands in a most
imperial situation —Considering its fine pavement,
its width, and the lofty houses on each side, this
would be undoubtedly one of the noblest streets
in Europe, if an ugly mass of mean buildings, called
the Lucken-Booths, had not thrust itself, by
what accident I know not, into the middle of the
way, like Middle-Row in Holborn. The city
stands upon two hills, and the bottom between
them; and, with all its defects, may very well
pass for the capital of a moderate kingdom —It is
full of people, and continually resounds with the
noise of coaches and other carriages, for luxury as
well as commerce. As far as I can perceive, her 

is no want of provisions —The beef and mutton
are as delicate here as in Wales; the sea affords
plenty of good fish; the bread is remarkably fine; 
and the water is excellent, though I'm afraid not
in sufficient quantity to answer all the purposes of
cleanliness and convenience; articles in which, it
must be allowed, our fellow-subjects are a little
defective —The water is brought in leadden pipes
from a mountain in the neighbourhood, to a cistern
on the Castle-hill, from whence it is distributed
to public conduits in different part of the city — 
From these it is carried in barrels, on the backs of
male and female porters, up two, three, four, five,
six, seven, and eight pair of stairs, for the use of
particular families —Every story is a complete
house, occupied by a separate family; and the
stair being common to them all, is generally left in
a very filthy condition; a man must tread with great
circumspection to get safe housed with unpolluted
shoes —Nothing can form a stronger contrast, than
the difference betwixt the outside and inside of the
door; for the good women of this metropolis are
remarkably nice in the ornaments and propriety of
their apartments, as if they were resolved to transfer
the imputation from the individual to the public. 
You are no stranger to their method of discharging
all their impurities from their windows, at a certain
hour of the night, as the custom is in Spain, Portugal,
and some parts of France and Italy —A practice
to which I can by no means be reconciled; for
notwithstanding all the care that is taken by their
scavengers to remove this nuisance every morning
by break of day, enough still remains to offend the
eyes, as well as other organs of those whom use
has not hardened against all delicacy of sensation. 
The inhabitans seem insensible to these impressions,
and are apt to imagine the disgust that we avow
is little better than affectation; but they ought to 

have some compassion for strangers, who have not
been used to this kind of sufferance; and consider,
whither it may not be worth while to take some
pains to vindicate themselves from the reproach that,
on this account, they bear among their neighbours. 
As to the surpising height of their houses, it is absurd
in many respects; but in one particular light I cannot
view it without horror; that is, the dreadful situation
of all the families above, in case the common
stair case should be rendered impassible by a
fire in the lower stories —In order to prevent the
shocking consequences that must attend such an accident,
it would be a right measure to open doors
of communication from one house to another, on
every story, by which the people might fly from
such a terrible visitation. In all parts of the world,
we see the force of habit prevailing over all the dictates
of convenience and sagacity —All the people
of business at Edinburgh, and even the genteel company,
may be seen standing in crowds every day,
from one to two in the afternoon, in the open
street, at a place where formerly stood a market-cross,
which (by the bye) was a curious piece of
Gothick architecture, still to be seen in lord Sommerville's
garden in this neighbourhood —I say,
the people stand in the open street from the force
of custom, rather than move a few yards to an Exchange
that stands empty on one side, or to the
parliament-close on the other, which is a noble
square, adorned with a fine equestrian statute of king
Charles II. —The company thus assembled, are
entertained with a variety of tunes, played upon a
set of bells, fixed in a steeple hard by —As these
bells are well-toned, and the musician, who has a
salary from the city, for playing upon them with
keys, is no bad performer, the entertainment is really
agreeable, and very striking to the ears of a stranger. 

The public inns of Edinburgh, are still worse
than those of London; but by means of a worthy
gentleman, to whom I was recommended, we
have got decent lodgings in the house of a widow
gentlewoman, of the name of Lockhart; and here
I shall stay until I have seen every thing that is remarkable
in and about this capital. I now begin
to feel the good effects of exercise —I eat like a
farmer, sleep from mid-night till eight in the morning
without interruption, and enjoy a constant tide
of spirits, equally distant from inanition and excess; 
but whatever ebbs or flows my constitution may
undergo, my heart will still declare that I am, 
Dear Lewis,
Your affectionate friend and servant,
Matt. Bramble, 
Edr. July 18.
