DEAR PHILLIPS,
WHEN I wrote to you by last post, I did not
imagine I should be tempted to trouble you again
so soon: but I now sit down with a heart so full
that it cannot contain itself; though I am under
such agitation of spirits, that you are to expect neither
method or connexion in this address —We
have been this day within a hair's breath of losing
honest Mathew Bramble, in consequence of a
cursed accident, which I will endeavour to explain. 
—In crossing the country to get into the post
road, it was necessary to ford a river, and we that
were a-horseback passed without any danger on
difficulty; but a great quantity of rain having fallen
last night and this morning, there was such
an accumulation of water, that a mill-head gave
way, just as the coach was passing under it, and
the flood rushed down with such impetuosity, as
first floated, and then fairly overturned the carriage
in the middle of the stream —Lismahago and I,
and the two servants, alighting instantaneously,
ran into the river to give all the assistance in our
power. —Our aunt, Mrs. Tabitha, who had the
good fortune to be uppermost, was already half
way out of the coach window, when her lover approaching,
disengaged her entirely; but, whether
his foot slipt or the burden was too great, they
fell over head and ears in each others arms. He
endeavoured more than once to get up, and even
to disentagle himself from her embrace, but she
hung about his neck like a mill-stone (no bad emblem
of matrimony,) and if my man had not
proved a staunch auxiliary, those two lovers would
in all probability have gone hand in hand to the 

shades below —For my part, I was too much engaged
to take any cognizance of their distress. — 
I snatched out my sister by the hair of the head,
and, dragging her to the bank, recollected that my
uncle had not yet appeared —Rushing again into
the stream, I met Clinker hauling ashore Mrs.
Jenkins, who looked like a mermaid with her hair
dishevelled about her ears; but, when I asked if
his master was safe, he forthwith shook her from
him, and she must have gone to pot, if a miller
had not seasonably come to her relief. —As for
Humphry, he flew like lightning to the coach,
that was by this time filled with water, and, diving
into it, brought up the poor 'squire, to all appearance,
deprived of life —It is not in my power
to describe what I felt at this melancholy spectacle
—it was such an agony as baffles all description! 
The faithful Clinker, taking him up in his arms,
as if he had been an infant of six months, carried
him ashore, howling most petiously all the way,
and I followed him in a transport of grief and consternation  —When he was laid upon the grass, and
turned from side to side, a great quantity of water
ran out at his mouth, then he opened his eyes,
and fetched a deep sigh —Clinker perceiving these
signs of life, immediately tied up his arm with a
garter, and, pulling out a horse-sleam, let him
blood in the farrier stile. —At first a few drops only
issued from the orifice; but the limb being chafed,
in a little time the blood began to flow in a continued
stream, and he uttered some incoherent words,
which were the most welcome sounds that ever saluted
my ear. There was a country inn heard by,
the landlord of which had by this time come with
his people to give their assistance. —Thither my
uncle being carried, was undressed and put to bed,
wrapped in warm blankets; but having been moved
too soon, he fainted away, and once more lay 

without sense or motion, notwithstanding all the
efforts of Clinker and the landlord, who bathed
his temples with Hungary water, and held a smelling
bottle to his nose. As I had heared of the efficacy
of salt in such cases, I ordered all that was in
the house to be laid under his head and body; and
whither this application had the desired effect, or
nature of herself prevailed, he, in less than a quarter
of an hour, began to breathe regularly, and
soon retrieved his recollection, to the unspeakable
joy of all the by-standers. As for Clinker,
his brain seemed to be affected. —He
laughed, and wept, and danced about in such a
distracted manner, that the landlord very judiciously
conveyed him out of the room. My uncle,
seeing me dropping wet, comprehended the whole
of what had happened, and asked if all the company
was safe? —Being answered in all the affirmative,
he insisted on my putting on dry clothes?
and, having swallowed a little warm wine, desired
he might be left to his repose. Before I went to
shift myself, I inquired about the rest of the family 
—I found Mrs. Tabitha still delirious from
her fright, discharging very copiously the water
she had swallowed. She was supported by the
captain, distilling drops from his uncurled periwig,
so lank and so dank, that he looked like father
Thame without his sedges, embracing Isis, while
she cascaded in his urn. Mrs. Jenkins was present
also, in a loose bedgown, without either cap
or handkerchief; but she seemed to be as little
compos mentis as her mistress, and acted so many
cross purposes in the course of her attendance, that,
between the two, Lismahago had occasion for all
his philosophy. As for Liddy, I thought the poor
girl would have actually lost her senses. The good
woman of the house had shifted her linen, and put 

her into bed; but she was seized with the idea that
her uncle had perished, and in this persuasion
made a dismal out-cry; nor did she pay the least
regard to what I said, when I solemnly assured her
he was safe. Mr. Bramble hearing the noise, and
being informed of her apprehension, desired she
might be brought into his chamber; and she no
sooner received this intimation, than she ran thither
half naked, with the wildest expression of eagerness
in her countenance —Seeing the 'squire
sitting up in the bed, she sprung forwards, and,
throwing her arms about his neck, exclaimed in a
most pathetic tone, “Are you—Are you indeed my
uncle—My dear uncle!—My best friend! My
father! —Are you really living? or is it an illusion
of my poor brain!” Honest Matthew
was so much affected, that he could not help shedding
tears, while he kissed her forehead, saying,
“My dear Liddy, I hope I shall live long enough
to shew how sensible I am of your affection — 
But your spirits are fluttered, child —You want
rest —Go to bed and compose yourself — 
Well, I will (she replied)—but still methinks
this cannot be real —The coach was full of water 
—My uncle was under us all —Gracious
God! —You was under water —How did you
get out?—tell me that? or I shall think this is
all a deception—” “In what manner I was
brought out, I know as little as you do, my
dear (said the 'squire); and truly that is a circumstance
of which I want to be informed.” I
would have given him a detail of the whole adventure,
but he would not hear me until I should
change my clothes; so that I had only time to tell
him, that he owed his life to the courage and fidelity
of Clinker; and having given him this hint, I
conducted my sister to her own chamber. 

This accident happened about three o'clock in
the afternoon, and in little more than an hour the
hurricane was all over; but as the carriage was
found to be so much damaged, that it could not
proceed without considerable repairs, a blacksmith
and wheelwright were immediately sent for to the
next market-town, and we congratulated ourselves
upon being housed at an inn, which, though remote
from the post-road, afforded exceeding good
lodging. The women being pretty well composed,
and the men all a-foot, my uncle sent for his servant,
and, in the presence of Lismahago and me,
accosted him in these words —“So, Clinker, I find
you are resolved I shan't die by water —As you
have fished me up from the bottom at your own
risque, you are at least entitled to all the money
that was in my pocket, and there it is—” So
saying, he presented him with a purse containing
thirty guineas, and a ring nearly of the same value 
—“God forbid! (cried Clinker) your honour shall
excuse me —I am a poor fellow; but I have a
heart —O! if your honour did but know how I
rejoiced to see —Blessed be his holy name, that
made me the humble instrument —But as for
the lucre of gain, I renounce it —I have done
no more than my duty —No more than I would
have done for the most worthless of my fellow-creatures 
—No more than I would have done for
captain Lismahago, or Archy Macalpine, or
any sinner upon earth —But for your worship, I
would go through fire as well as water—”  “I
do believe it, Humphry (said the 'squire); but
as you think it was your duty to save my life at
the hazard of your own, I think it is mine to
express the sense I have of your extraordinary
fidelity and attachment —I insist upon your receiving
this small token of my gratitude; but
don't imagine that I look upon this as an adequate 

recompense for the service you have done
me —I have determined to settle thirty pounds
a-year upon you for life; and I desire these
gentlemen will bear witness to this my intention,
of which I have a memorandum in my pocketbook.” 
“Lord make me thankful for all these
mercies! (cried Clinker, sobbing) I have been
a poor bankrupt from the beginning—your
honour's goodness found me, when I was—naked
—when I was—sick and forlorn —I understand
your honour's looks —I would not give
offence—but my heart is very full—and if your
worship won't give me leave to speak,—I must
vent it in prayers to heaven for my benefactor.” 
When he quitted the room, Lismahago said, he
should have a much better opinion of his honesty,
if he did not whine and cant so abominably; but
that he had always observed those weeping and
praying follows were hypocrites at bottem. Mr.
Bramble made no reply to this sarcastic remark,
proceeding from the lieutenant's resentment of
Clinker's having, in pure simplicity of heart, ranked
him with M'Alpine and the sinners of the earth, 
—The landlord being called to receive some
orders about the beds, told the 'squire that his
house was very much at his service, but he was
sure he should not have the honour to lodge him
and his company. He gave us to understand that
his master, who lived hard by, would not suffer
us to be at a publick house, when there was accommodation
for us at his own; and that, if he had
not dined abroad in the neighbourhood, he would
have undoubtedly come to offer his services at our
first arrival. He then launched out in praise of
that gentleman, whom he had served as butler,
representing him as a perfect miracle of goodness
and generosity. He said he was a person of great
learning, and allowed to be the best farmer in the 

country:—that he had a lady who was as much
beloved as himself, and an only son, a very hopeful
young gentleman, just recovered from a dangerous
fever, which had like to have proved fatal to
the whole family; for, if the son had died, he was
sure the parents would not have survived their loss. 
—He had not yet finished the encomium of Mr.
Dennison, when this gentleman arrived in a postchaise,
and his appearance seemed to justify all
that had been said in his favour. He is pretty well
advanced in years, but hale, robust, and florid,
with an ingenuous countenance, expressive of good
sense and humanity. Having condoled with us on
the accident which had happened, he said he was
come to conduct us to his habitation, where we
should be less incommoded than at such a paultry
inn, and expressed his hope that the ladies would
not be the worse for going thither in his carriage,
as the distance was not above a quarter of mile. 
My uncle having made a proper return to this
courteous exhibition, eyed him attentively, and
then asked if he had not been at Oxford, a commoner
of Queen's college? When Mr. Dennison
answered, “Yes,” with some marks of surprise — 
“Look at me then (said our 'squire) and let us
see if you can recollect the features of an old
friend, whom you have not seen these forty
years.” —The gentleman, taking him by the
hand, and gazing at him earnestly,—“I protest,
(cried he,) I do think I recall the idea of Matthew
Loyd of Glamorganshire, who was student
of Jesus.” “Well remembered, my dear
friend, Charles Dennison, (exclaimed my uncle,
pressing him to his brest), I am the very identical
Matthew Loyd of Glamorgan.” Clinker,
who had just entered the room with some coals for
the fire, no sooner heard these words, than, throwing
down the scuttle on the toes of Lismahago, he 

began to caper as if he was mad, crying —“Matthew
Loyd of Glamorgan! —O Providence! — 
Matthew Loyd of Glamorgan!” —Then,
clasping my uncle's knees, he went on in this manner 
—“Your worship must forgive me —Matthew
Loyd of Glamorgan! —O Lord, Sir! —I
can't contain myself! —I shall lose my senses—” 
Nay, thou hast lost them already, I believe,
(said the 'squire, peevishly) prithee Clinker be
quiet —What is the matter? —Humphery,
fumbling in his bosom, pulled out an old wooden
snuff-box, which he presented in great trepidation
to his master, who, opening it immediately, perceived
a small cornelian seal, and two scraps of
paper —At sight of these articles he started, and
changed colour, and, casting his eye upon the inscriptions 
—“Ha!—how!—what!—where (cried
he) is the person here named?” Clinker,
knocking his own breast, could hardly pronounce
these words —“Here—here—here is Matthew
Loyd, as the certificate sheweth —Humphry
Clinker was the name of the farrier that took me
'prentice” —“And who gave you these tokens,” 
—said my uncle, hastily —“My poor mother on
her death-bed”—replied the other —“And who
was your mother?” —Dorothy Twyford, an
“please your honour, heretofore bar-keeper at the
Angel at Chippenham.” —“And why were not
these tokens produced before?” “My mother
told me she had wrote to Glamorganshire, at the
time of my birth, but had no answer; and that
afterwards, when she made enquiry, there was
no such person in that county.” “And so in consequence
of my changing my name and going
abroad at that very time, the poor mother and
thou have been left to want and misery —I am
really shocked at the consequence of my own
folly.” Then, laying his hand on Clinker's 

head, he added, “Stand forth, Matthew Loyd 
—You see, gentlemen, how the sins of my
youth rise up in judgment against me —Here is
my direction written with my own hand, and a
seal which I left at the woman's request; and
this is a certificate of the child's baptism, signed
by the curate of the parish.” The company
were not a little surprised at this discovery, upon
which Mr. Dennison facetiously congratulated both
the father and the son: for my part, I shook my
new found cousin heartily by the hand, and Lismahago
complimented him with the tears in his
eyes, for he had been hopping about the room,
swearing in broad Scotch, and bellowing with the
pain occasioned by the fall of the coal-scuttle upon
his foot. He had even vowed to drive the saul out
of the body of that mad rascal: but, perceiving
the unexpected turn which things had taken, he
wished him joy of his good fortune, observing that
it went very near his heart, as he was like to be a
great toe out of pocket by the discovery —Mr. Dennison
now desired to know for what reason my uncle
had changed the name by which he knew him at
Oxford, and our 'squire satisfied him, by answering
to this effect. —“I took my mother's name,
which was Loyd, as heir to her lands in Glamorganshire; 
but, when I came of age, I sold
that property, in order to clear my paternal
estate, and resumed my real name; so that I am
now Matthew Bramble of Brambleton-hall in
Monmouthshire, at your service; and this is
my nephew Jeremy Melford of Belfield, in the
county of Glamorgan.” At that instant the
ladies entered the room, he presented Mrs. Tabitha
as his sister, and Liddy as his niece. The old
gentleman saluted them very cordially, and seemed
struck with the appearance of my sister, whom he
could not help surveying with a mixture of complacency 

and surprize —“Sister, (said my uncle)
there is a poor relation that recommends himself
to your good graces —The quondam Humphry
Clinker is methmorpaosed into Matthew Loyd; 
and claims the honour of being your carnal
kinsman—in short, the rogue proves to be a
crab of my own planting in the days of hot
blood and unrestrained libertinism.” Clinker
had by this time dropt upon one knee, by the side
of Mrs. Tabitha, who, eyeing him askance, and
flirting her fan with marks of agitation, thought
proper, after some conflict, to hold out her hand
for him to kiss, saying, with a demure aspect,
“Brother, you have been very wicked: but I
hope you'll live to see the folly of your ways — 
I am very sorry to say the young man, whom
you have this day acknowledged, has more grace
and religion, by the gift of God, than you
with all your profane learning, and repeated opportunity 
—I do think he has got the trick of the
eye, and the tip of the nose of my uncle Loyd of
Flluydwellyn and as for the long chin, it is the
very moral of the governor's —Brother, as you
have changed his name, pray change his dress
also; that livery doth not become any person
that hath got our blood in his veins.” —Liddy
seemed much pleased with this acquisition to the
family. —She took him by the hand, declaring she
should always be proud to own her connexion with
a virtuous young man, who had given so many
proofs of his gratitude and affection to her uncle. 
—Mrs. Winifred Jenkins, extremely fluttered between
her surprize at this discovery, and the apprehension
of losing her sweet-heart, exclaimed
in a giggling tone,—“I wish you joy, Mr. Clinker
—Floyd—I would say—hi, hi, hi,!—you'll
be so proud you won't look at your poor fellow
servants, oh, oh, oh!” Honest Clinker owned 

he was overjoyed at his good fortune, which was
greater than he deserved —“But wherefore should
I be proud? (said he) a poor object conceived
in sin, and brought forth in iniquity, nursed in
a parish work-house and bred in a smithy — 
Whenever I seem proud, Mrs. Jenkins, I beg
of you to put me in mind of the condition I was
in, when I first saw you between Chippenham
and Marlborough.” 
When this momentous affair was discussed to the
satisfaction of all parties concerned, the weather
being dry, the ladies declined the carriage; so that
we walked all together to Mr. Dennison's house,
where we found the tea ready prepared by his lady,
an amiable matron, who received us with all the
benevolence of hospitality. —The house is old
fashioned and irregular, but lodgeable and commodious. 
To the south it has the river in front, at the
distance of a hundred paces; and on the north,
there is a rising ground, covered with an agreeable
plantation; the greens and walks are kept in the
nicest order, and all is rural and romantic. I have
not yet seen the young gentleman, who is on a
visit to a friend in the neighbourhood, from whose
house he is not expected till to-morrow. 
In the mean time, as there is a man going to
the next market-town with letters for the post, I
take this opportunity to send you the history of this
day, which has been remarkably full of adventures; 
and you will own I give you them like a beef-steak
at Dolly's, hot and hot, without ceremony and
parade, just as they come from the recollection of 
yours,
J. Melford.
