Mrs. Hodges. In Answer. 

Sat. July 1. 
Maddam,
I return you an anser, as you wish me to doe. 
Master is acquented with no sitch man. I am
shure no sitch ever came to our house. And master
sturs very little out. He has no harte to stur out. 
For why? Your obstincy makes um not care to see
one another. Master's Birth-day never was kept soe
before: For not a sole heere; and nothing but siking
and sorrowin from master to think how it yused
to bee. 
I axed master, if soe bee he knoed sitch a man as
one Captain Tomlinson? But sayed not whirfor I
axed. He sed, No, not he. 
Shure this is no trix nor forgary bruing against
master by won Tomlinsonâ€”Won knoes not what
cumpany you may have been forsed to keep, sen you
went away, you knoe, Maddam. Excuse me,
Maddam; but Lundon is a pestilent plase; and that
Squire Luveless is a devil (for all he is sitch a like gentleman
to look to) as I hev herd every boddy say; 
and think as how you have found by thiss. 
I truste, Maddam, you wulde not let master cum
to harme, if you knoed it, by any boddy who may
pretend to be acquented with him: But for fere, I
querid with myself iff I shulde not tell him. But I
was willin to show you, that I wulde plessure you in
advarsity, if advarsity bee youre lott, as well as prosprity; 

for I am none of those as woulde doe otherwiss. 
Soe no more from 
Your humble Sarvant, to wish you well,
Sarah Hodges.
