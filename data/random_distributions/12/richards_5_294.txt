Sir Charles Grandison, To Lady Clementina. 
[Under Cover, To George Trumbull, Esq; &c.] 


St. James's Square, Wedn. night, Febr. 14. 
Ten days the noble Clementina in England, the
native place of her fourth brother, her equally 

admiring and faithful friend; yet not honour him
with the knowlege of her arrival! —Forgive me, if I
call you cruel. —It is in your power, madam, to make
one of the happiest men in the world a very unhappy
one; and you will effectually do it, if you keep from
him the opportunity of throwing himself at your feet,
and welcoming you to a country always dear to him,
but which will be made still dearer by your arrival
in it. 
I have a Letter from your and my Jeronymo. I
have a great deal to say to you of its contents; of
your father, mother, brothers—But it must be said,
not written. For God's sake, madam, permit me
to attend you in company of one of my sisters, or
otherwise, as you shall think best. You have in me
a faithful, an indulgent friend. I am no severe man:
Need I tell you that I am not? If you do not choose
that any-body else shall know the place of your abode,
I will faithfully keep your secret. You shall be as
much the mistress of your own will, of your own
actions, as if I knew not where to address myself to
you. If ever you had a kind thought of your fourth
brother, if you ever wished him happy, grant him
the favour of attending you; for his happiness, I repeat,
depends upon it. 
I received our Jeronymo's Letter but yesterday. 
Tender and affectionate are the contents. 
I have ridden post, to get hither this night, in hopes
of being favoured with intelligence of you. In the
morning I should have made enquiries at the proper
places: But little did I think my Sister could have
been so many days in town. Let not an hour pass
after this comes to your hand, before you relieve the
anxious heart of, 
Dearest Lady Clementina,
Your most affectionate Brother,
and faithful humble Servant,
Charles Grandison.
