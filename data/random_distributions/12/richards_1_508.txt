To John and Antony Harlowe, Esqrs. 

Honoured Sirs,
When these lines reach your hands, your late
unhappy Niece will have known the end of all
her troubles; and, as she humbly hopes, will be rejoicing
in the mercies of a gracious God, who has declared,
that He will forgive the truly penitent of
heart. 
I write, therefore, my dear Uncles, and to you
Both in one Letter (since your fraternal Love has
made you Both but as One person) to give you comfort,
and not distress; for, however sharp my afflictions
have been, they have been but of short duration; and
I am betimes (happily as I hope) arrived at the end of
a painful journey. 
At the same time, I write to thank you both, for all
your kind indulgence to me, and to beg your forgiveness
of my last, my only great fault to you and to my
family. 
The ways of Providence are unsearchable. Various
are the means made use of by It, to bring poor sinners
to a sense of their duty. Some are drawn by Love,
others are driven by Terrors, to their Divine Refuge. 
I had for Eighteen years out of Nineteen rejoiced in
the favour and affection of every one. No trouble
came near my heart. I seemed to be one of those designed
to be drawn by the silken cords of Love. —But,
perhaps, I was too apt to value myself upon the love
and favour of every one: The merit of the good I delighted
to do, and of the inclinations which were given
me, and which I could not help having, I was, perhaps,
too ready to attribute to myself; and now, being
led to account for the cause of my temporary calamities,
find, I had a secret pride to be punished for,
which I had not fathomed: And it was necessary perhaps 

that some sore and terrible misfortunes should befal
me, in order to mortify that my pride, and that my
vanity. 
Temptations were accordingly sent. I shrunk in
the day of tryal. My discretion, which had been so
cried up, was found wanting when it came to be weighed
in an equal balance. I was betrayed, fell, and
became the by-word of my companions, and a disgrace
to my family, which had prided itself in me perhaps
too much. But as my fault was not that of a culpable
will, when my pride was sufficiently mortified, I was
not suffered (altho' surrounded by dangers, and entangled
in snares) to be totally lost: But, purified by sufferings,
I was fitted for the change I have NOW,
at the time you will receive This, so newly, and, as
I humbly hope, so happily, experienced. 
Rejoice with me then, dear Sirs, that I have weathered
so great a storm. Nor let it be matter of concern,
that I am cut off in the bloom of youth. ‘There
is no inquisition in the grave,’ says the wise Man,
‘whether we lived ten or an hundred years; and the
day of death is better than the day of our birth.’ 
Once more, dear Sirs, accept my grateful thanks
for all your goodness to me, from my early childhood,
to the day, the unhappy day, of my error! Forgive
that error! —And God give us a happy meeting in a
blessed Eternity! prays 
Your most dutiful and obliged Kinswoman,
Clarissa Harlowe. 
Mr. Belford gives the Lady's posthumous Letters to
Mrs. Hervey, Miss Howe, and Mrs. Norton, at
length likewise: But, altho' every Letter varies in
style as well as matter from the others; yet, as
they are written on the same subject, and are pretty
long, it is thought proper to abstract them. 
That to her Aunt Hervey is written in the same
pious and generous strain with those preceding, seeking 

to give comfort rather than distress. ‘The Almighty,
I hope, says she, has received and blessed my penitence,
and I am happy. Could I have been more
than so, at the end of what is called a happy life of
20, or 30, or 40 years to come? And what are 20,
or 30, or 40 years to look back upon? In half of
any of these periods, what friends might I not have
mourned for? what temptations from worldly prosperity
might I not have encountered with? And in
such a case, immersed in earthly pleasures, how little
likelihood, that, in my last stage, I should have been
blessed with such a Preparation and Resignation, as I
have now been blessed with?’ 
She proceeds as follows: ‘Thus much, Madam, of
comfort to you and to myself from this dispensation. 
As to my dear Parents, I hope they will console
themselves, that they have still many blessings left,
which ought to balance the troubles my error has
given them: That, unhappy as I have been to be
the interrupter of their felicities, they never, till this
my fault, knew any heavy evil: That afflictions
patiently borne may be turned into blessings: That
uninterrupted happiness is not to be expected in this
life: That, after all, they have not, as I humbly
presume to hope, the probability of the everlasting
perdition of their child to deplore: And that, in
short, when my story comes to be fully known,
they will have the comfort to find, that my sufferings
redound more to my honour than to my disgrace. 
‘These considerations will, I hope, make their
temporary loss of but one child out of three (unhappily
circumstanced too as she was) matter of greater
consolation than affliction. And the rather, as we
may hope for a happy meeting once more, never to
be separated either by time or offences.’ 
She concludes this Letter with an address to her
Cousin Dolly Hervey, whom she calls her amiable
Cousin; and thankfully remembers for the part she 

took in her afflictions. —‘O my dear Cousin, let your
worthy heart be guarded against those delusions,
which have been fatal to my worldly happiness! — 
That pity, which you bestowed upon me, demonstrates
a gentleness of nature, which may possibly
subject you to misfortunes, if your eye be permitted
to mislead your judgment. —But a strict observance
of your filial duty, my dearest Cousin, and the precepts
of so prudent a Mother as you have the happiness
to have (enforced by so sad an example in your
own family as I have set) will, I make no doubt,
with the Divine Assistance, be your guard and security.’ 
The posthumous Letter to Miss Howe is extremely
tender and affectionate. She pathetically calls upon
her ‘to rejoice that all her Clarissa's troubles are now
at an end; that the state of temptation and tryal, of
doubt and uncertainty, is now over with her; and
that she has happily escaped the snares that were laid
for her soul: The rather to rejoice, as that her misfortunes
were of such a nature, that it was impossible
she could be tolerably happy in this life.’ 
She ‘thankfully acknowleges the favours she had received
from Mrs. Howe and Mr. Hickman; and
expresses her concern for the trouble she hasoccasioned
to the former, as well as to her; and prays,
that all the earthly blessings they used to wish to each
other, may singly devolve upon her.’ 
She beseeches her, ‘that she will not suspend the
day, which shall supply to herself the friend she will
have lost in her, and give to herself a still nearer
and dearer relation.’ 
She tells her, ‘That her choice (a choicemade with
the approbation of all her friends) has fallen upon a
sincere, an honest, a virtuous, and what is more
than all, a pious man; a man, who, altho' he admires
her person, is still more in love with the graces 

of her mind. And as those graces are improveable
with every added year of life, which will impair the
transitory ones of person, what a firm basis, infers
she, has Mr. Hickman chosen to build his Love
upon!’ 
She prays, ‘That God will bless them together: 
And that the remembrance of her, and of what she
has suffered, may not interrupt their mutual happiness,
she desires them to think of nothing but what
she Now is; and that a time will come, when they
shall meet again, never to be divided.’ 
‘To the Divine Protection, mean time, she commits
her; and charges her, by the Love that has
always subsisted between them, that she will not
mourn too heavily for her; and again calls upon her,
after a gentle tear, which she will allow her to let
fall in memory of their uninterrupted friendship, to
rejoice that she is so early released; and that she is
purified by her sufferings, and is made, as she assuredly
trusts, by God's goodness, eternally happy.’ 
The posthumous Letters to Mr. Lovelace and Mr.
Morden will be inserted hereafter: As will also
the substance of that written to Mrs. Norton.
