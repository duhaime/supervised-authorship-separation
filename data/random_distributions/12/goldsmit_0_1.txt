There are an hundred faults in
this Thing, and an hundred things
might be said to prove them beauties. But
it is needless. A book may be amusing
with numerous errors, or it may be very
dull without a single absurdity. The hero
of this piece unites in himself the three
greatest characters upon earth; he is a
priest, an husbandman, and the father of a
family. He is drawn as ready to teach,
and ready to obey, as simple in affluence,
and majestic in adversity. In this age of
opulence and refinement whom can such a
character please? Such as are fond of
high life, will turn with disdain from the
simplicity of his country fire-side. Such as
mistake ribaldry for humour, will find no
wit in his harmless conversation; and such 

as have been taught to deride religion, will
laugh at one whose chief stores of comfort
are drawn from futurity. 
Oliver Goldsmith.
