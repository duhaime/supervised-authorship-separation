I become acquainted with Narcissa's brother
who invites me to his house—where I am
introduced to that adorable creature—after
dinner, the squire retires to take his nap— 
Freeman, guessing the situation of my
thoughts, withdraws likewise on pretence of
business—I declare my passion for Narcissa
—am well received—charmed with her
conversation—the squire detains us to
supper—I elude his design by a stratagem,
and get home sober. 
In the afternoon, I drank tea at the house of
Mr. Freeman, to whom I had been recommended
by Banter; where I had not sat five
minutes, 'till the fox-hunter came in, and by his
familiar behaviour, appeared to be intimate with
my friend—I was, at first, under some concern,
lest he should recollect my features; but when I
found myself introduced to him as a gentleman
from London, without being discovered, I
blessed the opportunity that brought me into his
company; hoping, that in the course of our acquaintance,
he would invite me to his house— 
nor were my hopes frustrated, for as we spent
the evening together, he grew extremely fond of
my conversation, asked a great many childish
questions about France and foreign parts; and 

seemed so highly entertained with my answers,
that in his cups, he shook me often by the hand,
pronounced me an honest fellow, and in fine, desired
our company at dinner next day, in his
own house. —My imagination was so much employed
in anticipating the happiness I was to enjoy
next day, that I slept very little that night; 
but getting up early in the morning, went to the
place appointed, where I met my she-friend, and
imparted to her my success with the squire—She
was very much pleased at the occasion, which
(she said) could not fail of being agreeable to
Narcissa, who in spite of her passion for me,
had mentioned some scruples relating to my true
situation and character, which the delicacy of her
sentiments suggested, and which she believed
I would find it necessary to remove, though she
did not know how. —I was a good deal startled at
this insinuation, because I foresaw the difficulty
I should find in barely doing myself justice; for
although it never was my intention to impose myself
upon any woman, much less on Narcissa, as
a man of fortune, I laid claim to the character of
a gentleman, by birth, education and behaviour; 
and yet (so unlucky had the circumstances of my
life fallen out) I should find it a very hard matter
to make good my pretensions even to these, especially
to the last, which was the most essential— 
Miss Williams was as sensible as I, of this my disadvantage; 
but comforted me with observing,
that when once a woman has bestowed her affections
on a man, she cannot help judging of
him in all respects, with a partiality easily influenced
in his favour;—she remarked that altho'
some situations of my life had been low, yet none
of them had been infamous; that my indigence 

had been the crime not of me, but of fortune; 
and that the miseries I had undergone, by improving
the faculties both of mind and body,
qualified me the more for any dignified station; 
and would of consequence, recommend me to the
good graces of any sensible woman;—she therefore
advised me to be always open and unreserved to
the inquiries of my mistress, without unnecessarily
betraying the meanest occurrences of my
fate; and trust to the strength of her love and reflection,
for the rest. —The sentiments of this
sensible young woman on this, as well as on almost
every other subject, perfectly agreed with
mine; I thanked her for the care she took of my
interests, and promising to behave myself according
to her direction, we parted, after she had
assured me, that I might depend upon her best
offices with her mistress, and that she would from
time to time, communicate to me such intelligence
as she could procure, relating to my flame. 
—Having dressed myself to the best advantage, I
waited for the time of dinner with the most fearful
impatience; and as the hour drew nigh, my
heart beat with such increased velocity, and my
spirits contracted such disorder, that I began to
suspect my resolution, and even to wish myself
disengaged: —At last Mr. Freeman called at my
lodgings, in his way, and I accompanied him to
the house where all my happiness was deposited. 
—We were very kindly received by the squire,
who sat smoaking his pipe in a parlour, and asked
if we chose to drink any thing before dinner; 
tho' I never had more occasion for a cordial, I
was ashamed to accept his offer, which was also
refused by my friend. We sat down (however)
and entered into conversation, which lasted half an 

hour, so that I had time to recollect myself; and
(so capricious were my thoughts) even to hope that
Narcissa would not appear—when all of a sudden,
a servant coming in, gave us notice that dinner
was upon the table—and my perturbation returned
with such violence, that I could scarce conceal
it from the company as I ascended the staircase. 
—When I entered the dining-room, the first
object that saluted my ravished eyes, was the divine
Narcissa, blushing like Aurora, adorned with
all the graces that meekness, innocence and
beauty can diffuse! I was seized with a giddiness,
my knees tottered, and I scarce had strength
enough to perform the ceremony of salutation,
when her brother slapping me upon the shoulder,
cried “Measter Randan, that there is my
sister.” I approached her with eagerness and
fear; but in the moment of our embrace, my
soul was agonized with rapture! —It was a lucky
circumstance for us both, that my entertainer was
not endued with an uncommon stock of penetration; 
for our mutual confusion was so manifest,
that Mr. Freeman perceived it, and as we went
home together, congratulated me on my good
fortune. —But so far was Bruin from entertaining
the least suspicion, that he encouraged me to begin
a conversation with my mistress in a language
unknown to him, by telling her, that he had
brought a gentleman (meaning me) who could
jabber with her in French and other foreign
lingos, as fast as she pleased: then turning to me,
said, “Odds bobs! I wish you would hold discourse
with her, in your French or Italiano; 
and tell me if she understands it as well as she
would be thought to do—there's her aunt
and she will chatter together whole days in it, 

and I can't have a mouthful of English for love
or money.” I consulted the looks of my amiable
mistress, and sound her averse to his proposal,
which indeed she declined with a sweetness
of denial peculiar to herself, as a piece of
disrespect to that part of the company which did
not understand the language in question. As I
had the happiness of sitting opposite to her, I
feasted my eyes much more than my palate,
which she tempted in vain with the most delicious
bits carved by her fair hand, and recommended
by her persuasive tongue;—but all my
other appetites were swallowed up in the immensity
of my love, which I fed by gazing incessantly
on the delightful object. —Dinner was scarce
ended, when the squire became very drousy, and
after several dreadful yawns, got up, stretched
himself, took two or three turns across the room,
begg'd we would allow him to take a short nap,
and having laid a strong injunction on his sister
to detain us 'till his return, went to his repose
without any further ceremony. —He had not been
gone many minutes, when Freeman guessing the
situation of my heart, and thinking he could not
do me a greater favour, than to leave me alone
with Narcissa, pretended to recollect himself all
of a sudden, and starting up, begg'd the lady's
pardon for half an hour, having luckily remembered
an engagement of some consequence,
that he must perform at that instant,—so saying, he
went away, promising to be back in time enough
for tea; leaving my mistress and me in great confusion. 
—Now that I enjoyed an opportunity of
disclosing the pantings, of my soul, I had not
power to use it—I studied many pathetic declarations,
but when I attempted to give them utterance, 

my tongue denied its office; and she
sat silent, with a downcast look full of anxious
alarm, her bosom heaving with expectation of
some great event—At length, I endeavoured to
put an end to this solemn pause, and began with
“It is very surprizing, Madam—here the sound
dying away, I made a full stop—while Narcissa
starting, blushed, and with a timid accent, answered,
“Sir?—Confounded at this note of interrogation,
I pronounced with the most sheepish
bashfulness, “Madam!” to which she replied,
“I beg pardon—I thought you had spoke
to me.” “—Another pause ensued—I made another
effort, and tho' my voice faultered very
much at the beginning, made shift to express
myself in this manner: —“I say, Madam, 'tis
very surprizing that love should act so inconsistent
with itself, as to deprive its votaries of
the use of their faculties, when they have most
occasion for them. Since the happy occasion of
being alone with you presented itself, I have
made many unsuccessful attempts to declare a
passion for the loveliest of her sex—a passion
which took possession of my soul, while my
cruel fate compell'd me to wear a servile disguise
so unsuitable to my birth, sentiments, and
let me add, my deserts; yet favourable in one
respect, as it furnished me with opportunities
of seeing and adoring your perfections— 
Yes, Madam, it was then your dear idea
entered my bosom, where it has lived unimpaired
in the midst of numberless cares, and
animated me against a thousand dangers and calamities!” 
—While I spoke thus, she concealed
her face with her fan; and when I 

ceased, recovering herself from the most beautiful
confusion, told me, that she thought herself
very much obliged by my favourable opinion of
her; and that she was very sorry to hear I had
been unfortunate—Encouraged by this gentle reply,
I proceeded, owned myself sufficiently recompensed
by her kind compassion for what I
had undergone, and declared that the future happiness
of my life depended solely upon her. —“Sir,
(said she) I should be very ungrateful, if after
the signal protection you once afforded me, I
could refuse to contribute towards your happiness,
in any reasonable condescension.” — 
Transported at this acknowledgment; I threw
myself at her feet, and begged she would regard
my passion with a favourable eye: She was
alarmed at my behaviour, intreated me to rise lest
her brother should discover me in that posture,
and to spare her, for the present, upon a subject
for which she was altogether unprepared. —Upon
this, I rose, assuring her I would rather die than
disobey her; but in the mean time begged her to
consider how precious the minutes of this opportunity
were, and what restraint I put upon
my inclination, in sacrificing them to her desire. 
—She smiled with unspeakable sweetness, and
said, there would be no want of opportunities,
provided I could maintain the good opinion her
brother had conceived of me; and I, enchanted
with her charms, seized her hand, which I well
nigh devoured with kisses—But she check'd my
boldness with a severity of countenance; and desired
I would not so far forget myself or her, as to
endanger the esteem she had for me;—she reminded
me of our being almost strangers to one
another, and of the necessity there was, for her 

knowing me better, before she could take any resolution
in my favour; and, in short, mingled so
much good sense and complacency in her reproof,
that I became as much enamoured of her understanding,
as I had been before of her beauty,
and asked pardon for my presumption with the
utmost reverence of conviction—She forgave my
offence with her usual affability; and sealed my
pardon with a look so full of bewitching tenderness,
that for some minutes, my senses were lost
in exstasy! I afterwards endeavoured to regulate
my behaviour according to her desire, and turn
the conversation upon a more indifferent subject; 
but her presence was an unsurmountable obstacle
to my design; while I beheld so much excellence,
I found it impossible to call my attention from
the contemplation of it! I gazed with unutterable
fondness! I grew mad with admiration! —“My
condition is unsupportable (cried I) I am distracted
with passion! why are you so exquisitely
fair? —Why are you so enchantingly
good? —Why has nature dignified you with
charms so much above the standard of woman; 
and, wretch that I am, how dares my
unworthiness aspire to the enjoyment of such
perfection!” 
She was startled at my ravings, reasoned down
my transport, and by her irresistible eloquence,
soothed my soul into a state of tranquil felicity; 
but lest I might suffer a relapse, industriously promoted
other subjects to entertain my imagination
—she chid me for having omitted to inquire about
her aunt, who (she assured me) in the midst of
all her absence of temper, and detachment from
common affairs, often talked of me with uncommon
warmth. —I professed my veneration for the 

good lady, excused my omission, by imputing it
to the violence of my love, which engrossed my
whole soul, and desired to know the present situation
of her health. —Upon which, the amiable
Narcissa repeated what I had heard before, of her
marriage, with all the tenderness for her reputation
that the subject would admit of; told me,
she liv'd with her husband, hard by, and was
so much afflicted with a dropsy, and wasted by a
consumption, that she had small hopes of her recovery. 
—Having expressed my sorrow for her distemper,
I questioned her about my good friend
Mrs. Sagely, who I learned (to my great satisfaction)
was still in good health, and by the
encomiums she bestowed upon me after I was
gone, confirmed the favourable impression, my
behaviour at parting had made on Narcissa's
heart—This circumstance introduced an inquiry
into the conduct of Sir Timothy Thicket, who
(she informed me) had found means to incense
her brother so much against me, that she found it
impossible to undeceive him; but on the contrary,
suffered very much in her own character, by his
scandalous insinuations—that the whole parish
was alarmed, and actually in pursuit of me; so
that she had been in the utmost consternation upon
my account, well knowing how little my own
innocence and her testimony would have weighed
with the ignorance, prejudice and brutality of
those, who must have judged me, had I been apprehended
—that Sir Timothy being seized with
a fit of the apoplexy, from which with great
difficulty he was recovered, began to be apprehensive
of death, and to prepare himself accordingly
for that great event; as a step to which,
he sent for her brother, owned with great contrition, 

the brutal design he had upon her, and
of consequence acquitted me of the assault, robbery
and correspondence with her, which he had
laid to my charge, after which confession he lived
about a month in a languishing condition, and
was carried off by a second assault. 
Every word that this dear creature spoke, rivetted
the chains with which she held me enslaved! 
My mischievous fancy began to work, and the
tempest of my passion to wake again; when
the return of Freeman destroyed the tempting
opportunity, and enabled me to quell the rising
tumult. —A little while after, the Squire staggered
into the room, rubbing his eyes, and called for
his tea, which he drank out of a small bowl,
qualified with brandy; we sipped some in the
ordinary way: Narcissa left us in order to visit
her aunt, and when Freeman and I proposed to
take our leave, the fox-hunter insisted on our
spending the evening at his house with such obstinacy
of affection, that we were obliged to
comply. —For my own part, I should have been
glad of the invitation, by which, in all likelihood,
I would be blest with his sister's company,
had I not been afraid of risking her esteem, by
entering into a debauch of drinking with him,
which, from the knowledge of his character, I
foresaw would happen; but there was no remedy
—I was forced to rely upon the strength of my
constitution, which I hoped would resist intoxication
longer than the Squire's; and to trust to
the good-nature and discretion of my mistress for
the rest. 
Our entertainer resolving to begin by times,
ordered the table to be furnished with liquor and
glasses immediately after tea, but we absolutely 

refused to set in for drinking so soon; and prevailed
upon him to pass away an hour or two at
whist, in which we engaged as soon as Narcissa
returned. —The savage and I happened to be partners
at first, and as my thoughts were wholly employed
on a more interesting game, I play'd so
ill that he lost all patience, swore bitterly, and
threatened to call for wine if they would not
grant him another associate. —This desire was
gratified, and Narcissa and I were of a side; he
won for the same reason that made him lose before; 
I was satisfied, my lovely partner did not
repine, and the time slipped away very agreeably,
until we were told that supper was served in
another room. 
The Squire was enraged to find the evening
so unprofitably spent, and wrecked his vengeance
on the cards, which he tore, and committed to
the flames with many execrations; threatning to
make us redeem our loss with a large glass and a
quick circulation; and indeed we had no sooner
supped, and my charmer withdrawn, than he began
to put his threats in execution. Three bottles
of port (for he drank no other sort of wine)
were placed before us, with as many water-glasses,
which were immediately filled to the brim, after
his example, by each out of his respective allowance,
and emptied in a trice, to the best in christendom. 
—Though I swallowed this, and the next
as fast as the glass could be replenished, without
hesitation or shew of reluctance, I perceived that
my brain would not be able to bear many bumpers
of this sort; and dreading the perseverance of
a champion who began with such vigour, I determined
to make up for the deficiency of my strength
by a stratagem, which I actually put in practice 

when the second course of bottles was called for. 
—The wine being strong and heady, I was already
a good deal discomposed by the dispatch
we had made, Freeman's eyes began to reel, and
Bruin himself was elevated into a song, which he
uttered with great vociferation. —When I
therefore saw the second round brought in, I assumed
a gay air, entertained him with a French
catch on the subject of drinking, which, though
he did not understand it, delighted him highly,
and telling him that your choice spirits at Paris
never troubled themselves with glasses, asked if
he had not a bowl or cup in the house that
would contain a whole quart of wine. —“Odds
niggers! (cried he) I have a silver caudle-cup
that holds just the quantity, for all the world
—fetch it hither, Numps.” —The vessel being
produced, I bid him decant his bottle into
it, which having done, I nodded in a very deliberate
manner, and said, “Pledge you.” —He
stared at me for some time, and crying, “What!
all at one pull, measter Randan?” —I answered,
At one pull! Sir, you are no milk-sop—we shall
do you justice.” —“Shall you? (said he, shaking
me by the hand) odd then, I'll see it out,
an't were a mile to the bottom—Here's to
our better acquaintance, measter Randan.” 
So saying, he applied it to his lips, and emptied
it in a breath. —I knew the effect of it would
be almost instantaneous; therefore, taking the cup,
I began to discharge my bottle into it, telling
him he was now qualified to drink with the
Cham of Tartary. —I had no sooner pronounced
these words, than he took umbrage at them, and
after several attempts to spit, made shift to stutter 

out, “A f—f—t for your Chams of T&wblank; 
Tartary! I am a f—f—free-born Englishman,
worth th—three thousand a year, and
v—value no man, damme!”—then dropping
his jaw, and fixing his eyes, he hick up'd
aloud, and fell upon the floor as mute as a
flounder. —Mr. Freeman, heartily rejoiced at his
defeat, assisted me in carrying him to bed, where
we left him to the care of his servants, and went
home to our respective habitations, congratulating
one another on our good fortune.
