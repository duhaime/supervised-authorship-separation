Day breaking, I have the pleasure of viewing
the person of Miss Snapper, whom I had
not seen before—the soldier is witty
upon me—is offended, talks much of his
valour—is reprimanded by a grave
gentlewoman—we are alarmed with the
cry of highwaymen—I get out of the
coach, and stand on my defence—they
ride off without having attacked us— 
I pursue them—one of them is thrown
from his horse and taken—I return to
the coach—am complimented by miss Snapper
—the captain's behaviour on this
occasion—the prude reproaches me in a
soliloquy—I upbraid her in the same
manner—the behaviour of Mrs. Snapper
at breakfast, disobliges me—the lawyer
is witty upon the officer, who threatens
him. 
In the mean time, day breaking in upon us,
discovered to one another, the faces of their
fellow-travellers; and I had the good fortune to
find my mistress not quite so deformed nor disagreeable
as she had been represented to me. — 
Her head, indeed, bore some resemblance to a
hatchet, the edge being represented by her face; 
but she had a certain delicacy in her complexion, 

and a great deal of vivacity in her eyes, which
were very large and black; and though the protuberance
of her breast, when considered alone,
seemed to drag her forwards, it was easy to
perceive an equivalent on her back which ballanced
the other, and kept her body in equilibrio. 
—On the whole, I thought I should have great
reason to congratulate myself, if it should be my
fate to possess twenty thousand pounds encumbered
with such a wife. —I began therefore to deliberate
about the most probable means of acquiring
the conquest, and was so much engrossed by
this idea, that I scarce took any notice of the
rest of the people in the coach, but revolved my
prospect in silence; while the conversation was
maintained as before, by the object of my hopes,
the son of Mars, and the barrister, who by this
time had recollected himself, and talked in terms
as much as ever. —At length a dispute happened,
which ended in a wager, to be determined by
me, who was so much absorpt in contemplation,
that I neither heard the reference nor the question
which was put to me by each in his turn; 
affronted at my supposed contempt, the soldier
with great vociferation, swore, I was either
dumb or deaf, if not both, and that I looked as
if I could not say Boh to a goose. —Arroused at
this observation, I fixed my eyes upon him,
and pronounced with emphasis, the interjection
Boh! Upon which he cocked his hat in a fierce
manner and cried, “Damme, Sir, what d'ye
mean by that?” —Had I intended to answer
him, which by the bye, was not my design, I
should have been anticipated by Miss, who told
him, my meaning was to shew, that I could
cry boh! to a goose; and laughed very heartily 

at my laconie reproof. —Her explanation and
mirth did not help to appease his wrath, which
broke out in several martial insinuations, such as
—“I do not understand such freedoms, damme!
—D&wblank;n my blood! I'm a gentleman, and
bear the king's commission. —'Sblood! some
people deserve to have their noses pulled for
their impertinence.” —I thought to have
checked these ejaculations by a frown; because
he had talked so much of his valour, that I had
long ago rated him an ass with a lion's skin; 
but so far from answering my expectation, that
he took umbrage at the contraction of my brows,
swore he did not value my sulky look a fig's
end, and protested he seared no man breathing. 
—Miss Snapper said, she was very glad to find
herself in company with a man of so much courage,
who she did not doubt, would protect us
all from the attempts of highwaymen, during our
journey. —“Make yourself perfectly easy on
that head, madam, (replied the officer) I
have got a pair of pistols (here they are) which
I took from a horse officer at the battle of
Dettingen—they are double loaded, and if
any highwayman in England robbs you of
the value of a pin, while I have the honour
of being in your company, d&wblank;n my heart.” 
—When he had expressed himself in this manner,
a prim gentlewoman, who had sat silent
hitherto, opened her mouth, and said, she wondered
how any man could be so rude as to pull out
such weapons before ladies. —“Damme, madam,
(cried the champion) if you are so
much afraid at sight of a pistol, how dy'e propose
to stand fire if there should be occasion?” 
—She let him know, that if she thought he could 

be so unmannerly as to use fire-arms in her presence,
whatever might be the occasion, she would
get out of the coach immediately, and walk to
the next village, where she might procure a convenience
to herself. —Before he could make any
answer, my Dulcinea interposed, and observed,
that so far from being offended at a gentleman's
using his arms in his own defence, she thought
herself very lucky in being along with one by
whose valour she stood a good chance of saving
herself from being rifled. —The prude cast a disdainful
look at Miss, and said, that people who
have but little to lose, are sometimes the most solicitous
about preserving it. —The old lady was
affronted at this inuendo, and took notice, that
people ought to be very well informed before they
speak slightingly of other people's fortune, lest
they discover their own envy, and make themselves
ridiculous. —The daughter declared, that
she did not pretend to vie with any body in point
of riches; and if the lady who insisted upon non-resistance,
would promise to indemnify us all for
the loss we should sustain; she should be one of
the first to persuade the captain to submission, in
case we should be attacked. —To this proposal,
reasonable as it was, the reserved lady made no
other reply, than a scornful glance and a toss of
her head. —I was very well pleased with the spirit
of my mistress; and even wished for an opportunity
of distinguishing my courage under her
eye, which I believed, could not fail of prepossessing
her in my favour; when all of a sudden,
Strap rode up to the coach door, and told
us in a great fright, that two men on horse-back
were crossing the heath (for by this time we had
passed Hounslow) and made directly towards us. 

This piece of information was no sooner delivered,
than Mrs. Snapper began scream, her daughter
grew pale, the other lady pulled out her purse to
be in readiness, the lawyer's teeth chattered,
while he pronounced, “'Tis no matter—we'll
sue the county and recover.” —The captain
gave evident signs of confusion; and I, after having
commanded the coachman to stop, opened
the door, jumped out, and invited the warrior to
follow me. —But finding him backward and astonished,
I took his pistols, and giving them to
Strap, who had by this time alighted, and trembled
very much, I mounted on horse-back; and
taking my own, (which I could better depend
upon) from the holsters, cocked them both, and
faced the robbers, who were now very near us. 
—Seeing me ready to oppose them on horse-back,
and another man armed a-foot, they made a halt
at some distance to reconnoitre us, and after
having rode around us twice, myself still facing
about as they rode, went off the same way they
came, at a hand gallop. —A gentleman's servant
coming up with a horse at the same time, I offered
him a crown to assist me in pursuing them, which
he no sooner accepted, than I armed him with the
officer's pistols, and we galloped after the thieves,
who trusting to the swiftness of their horses,
stopped till we came within shot of them, and
then firing at us, put their nags to the full speed. 
—We followed them as fast as our beasts could
carry us, but not being so well mounted as they,
our efforts would have been to little purpose, had
not the horse of one of them stumbled and
thrown his rider with such violence over his head,
that he lay senseless, when we came up, and was
taken without the least opposition, while his 

comrade consulted his own safety in flight, without
regarding the distress of his friend. We scarce
had time to make ourselves masters of his arms,
and tye his hands together, before he recovered his
senses; when learning his situation, he affected surprize,
demanded to know by what authority we
used a gentleman in that manner, and had the
impudence to threaten us with a prosecution for
robbery. —In the mean time we perceived Strap
coming up with a crowd of people, armed with
different kinds of weapons; and among the rest
a farmer, who no sooner perceived the thief,
whom we had secured, than he cried with great
emotion, “There's the fellow who robbed me
an hour ago, of twenty pounds, in a canvas
bag.” —He was immediately searched, and the
money found exactly as it had been described:
Upon which, we committed him to the charge
of the countryman, who guarded him to the
town of Hounslow, which it seems the farmer had
alarmed; and having satisfied the footman for his
trouble according to promise, returned with Strap
to the coach, where I found the captain and
lawyer busy in administring smelling bottles and
cordials to the grave lady, who had gone into a
fit at the noise of the firing. 
When I had taken my seat, Miss Snapper, who from
the coach had seen every thing that happened, made
me a compliment on my behaviour, and said, she
was glad to see me returned, without having received
any injury; her mother too owned herself obliged
to my resolution; and the lawyer told me, that I was
intitled by act of parliament to a reward of forty
pounds, for having apprehended a highwayman. 
—The soldier observed, with a countenance in
which impudence and shame struggling, produced 

some disorder, that if I had not been in such
a damned hurry to get out of the coach, he would
have secured the rogues effectually, without all
this bustle and loss of time, by a scheme which
my heat and precipitation ruined. —“For my
own part, (continued he) I am always extremely
cool on these occasions.” —“So it
appeared, by your trembling” (said the young
lady.) —“Death and damnation (cried he) your
sex protects you, madam; if any man on
earth durst tell me so much, I'd send him to
hell, d&wblank;n my heart! in an instant.” —So saying,
he fixed his eyes on me, and asked if I had
seen him tremble. —I answered without hesitation,
“Yes.” —“Damme, Sir, (said he) d'ye doubt
my courage?” —I replied, “Very much.” — 
This declaration quite disconcerted him. —He
looked blank, and pronounced with a faultering
voice, “O! 'tis very well—d&wblank;n my blood! 
I shall find a time.” —I signified my contempt
of him, by thrusting my tongue in my cheek,
which humbled him so much, that he scarce swore
another oath during the whole journey. 
The precise lady, having recruited her spirits
by the help of some strong waters, began a soliloquy,
in which she wondered that any man,
who pretended to maintain the character of a
gentleman, could, for the sake of a little paultry
coin, throw persons of honour into such quandaries
as might endanger their lives; and professed
her surprize, that women were not ashamed
to commend such brutality. At the same time
vowing, that for the future she would never set
foot in a stage-coach, if a private convenience
could be had for love or money. 

Nettled at her remarks, I took the same method
of conveying my sentiments, and wondered
in my turn, that any woman of common sense,
should be so unreasonable as to expect that people
who had neither acquaintance nor connexion
with her, would tamely allow themselves to be
robbed and mal-treated, meerly to indulge her
capricious humour. I likewise confessed my astonishment
at her insolence and ingratitude in taxing
a person with brutality, who deserved her
approbation and acknowledgment; and vowed,
that if ever we should be assaulted again, I would
leave her to the mercy of the spoiler, that she
might know the value of my protection. 
This person of honour did not think fit to
carry on the altercation any further, but seemed
to chew the cud of her resentment, with the crest-fallen
captain, while I entered into discourse with
mu charmer, who was the more pleased with
my conversation, as she had conceived a very indifferent
opinion of my intellects from my former
silence. I should have had cause to be
equally satisfied with the sprightliness of her genius,
could she have curbed her imagination with
judgment; but she laboured under such a profusion
of talk, that I dreaded her unruly tongue, and
felt by anticipation the horrors of an eternal
clack! However, when I considered on the other
hand, the joys attending the possession of
twenty thousand pounds, I forgot her imperfections,
seized occasion by the fore-lock, and endeavoured
to insinuate myself into her affection. 
—The careful mother kept a strict watch over
her, and though she could not help behaving
civilly to me, took frequent opportunities of discouraging
our communication, by reprimanding 

her for being so free with strangers, and telling
her she must learn to speak less, and think more. 
—Abridged of the use of speech, we conversed
with our eyes, and I found the young lady very
eloquent in this kind of discourse. In short, I
had reason to believe, that she was sick of the old
gentlewoman's tuition, and that I should find it
no difficult matter to supersede her authority. 
When we arrived at the place where we were
to breakfast, I alighted and helped my mistress
out of the coach, as well as her mother, who
called for a private room, to which they withdrew,
in order to eat by themselves. —As they
retired together, I perceived that Miss had got
more twists from nature, than I had before observed,
being bent sideways into the figure of an
S, so that her progression very much resembled
that of a crab. —The prude also chose the captain
for her mess-mate, and ordered breakfast for two
only to be brought into another separate room; 
while the lawyer and I, deserted by the rest of the
company, were said to put up with one another. 
I was a good deal chagrined at the stately reserve
of Mrs. Snapper, who I thought did not
use me with all the complaisance I deserved; and
my companion declared, that he had been a traveller
these twenty years, and never knew the
stage-coach rules so much infringed before. As
for the honourable gentlewoman, I could not
conceive the meaning of her attachment to the
lieutenant; and asked the lawyer if he knew for
which of the soldier's virtues she admired him? 
The counsellor facetiously replied, “I suppose
the lady knows him to be an able conveyancer,
and wants him to make a settlement intail.” — 
I could not help laughing at the archness of the 

barrister, who entertained me during breakfast,
with a great deal of wit of the same kind, at
the expence of our fellow-travellers; and among
other things said, he was sorry to find the young
lady saddled with such incumbrances. 
When we had made an end of our repast, and
paid our reckoning, we went into the coach, took
our places, and bribed the driver with six-pence,
to revenge us on the rest of his fare, by hurrying
them away in the midst of their meal. —This he
performed to our satisfaction, after he had disturbed
their enjoyment with his importunate clamour. — 
The mother and daughter obeyed the summons
first, and coming to the coach-door, were obliged
to desire the coachman's assistance to get
in, because the lawyer and I had agreed to shew
our resentment by our neglect. —They were
no sooner seated, than the captain appeared as
much heated as if he had been pursued a dozen
of miles by an enemy; and immediately after him
came the lady, not without some marks of disorder. 
—Having helped her up, he entered himself,
growling a few oaths against the coachman
for his impertinent interruption; and the lawyer
comforted him, by saying, that if he had suffered
a nisi prius through the obstinacy of the defendant,
he would have an opportunity to join issue
at the next stage. This last expression gave offence
to the grave gentlewoman, who told him,
if she was a man, she would make him repent of
such obscenity, and thanked God she had never
been in such company before. —At this insinuation,
the captain thought himself under a necessity
of espousing the lady's cause; and accordingly
threatened to cut the lawyer's ears out of
his head, if he should give his tongue any such 

liberties for the future. —The poor counsellor
begged pardon, and universal silence ensued.
