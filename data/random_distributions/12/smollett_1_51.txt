Monimia's honour is protected by the interposition
of Heaven. 
With that complacency and fortitude
which were peculiar to herself, this hapless
stranger resisted all those artful temptations. 
Her sustenance was barely such as exempted
her from the guilt of being accessory to her
own death: her drink was the simple element:
she encouraged no discourse but that which
turned upon the concerns of her immortal
part; she never went abroad, except in visits to
a French chapel in the neighbourhood; she
refused the proffered assistance of our adventurer
with equal obstinacy and politeness, and
with pleasure saw herself wasting towards that
period of mortality which was the consummation
of her wish. Yet her charms, far
from melting away with her constitution, seemed
to triumph over the decays of nature; 
her shape and features still retained that harmony
for which they had always been distinguished; 
a mixture of majesty and sweetness
diffused itself in her looks, and her feebleness
added to that soft and feminine grace which
attracts the sympathy, and engages the protection
of every humane beholder. The associates,
thus baffled in their attempts to excite
her ideas of pleasure, again shifted their plan,
and resolved to attack this forlorn beauty, on
the side of fear and mortification. 
Our adventurer became less frequent in his
visits, and more indifferent in his language and 

deportment; while Madam la Mer gradually
relaxed in that complacency and respect with
which she had hitherto behaved towards her
fair lodger. She even began to drop hints of
disapprobation and reproach against this pattern
of innocence and beauty, and at length grew
bold enough to tell her, that her misfortunes
could be attributed to nothing but her own obstinacy
and pride; that she had been at great
pains to disoblige the only person who was
able and willing to raise her above dependance; 
and that if his protection should be withdrawn,
she must be exposed to the utmost extremity of
distress. 
These insinuations, instead of producing the
desired effect, inflamed the indignation of Monimia,
who, in a most dignified stile of rebuke,
chid her for her indelicacy and presumption,
observing, that she could have no title to
take such freedoms with lodgers, whose punctuality
and regular deportment left her no
room to complain. Notwithstanding this animated
reply, she underwent the most deplorable
anguish, when she reflected upon the insolence
of this woman, from whose barbarity she had
no resource; and seeing no other possibility of
redress, than that of appealing to the good
offices of Fathom, she conquered her reluctance
so far, as to complain to him of Madam la Mer's
incivility. 
Pleased with this application, he gave her to
understand, with very little ceremony or preamble,
that it wholly depended upon herself,
whether she should continue to be wretched,
or be delivered at once from all her cares and
perplexity; that, notwithstanding the disdain 

with which she had treated his addresses, he
was still ready to lay himself and his fortune
at her feet; and that if she should again reject
the disinterested proposal, the whole
world, and her own conscience, would charge
upon herself, whatever calamities she might
be subjected to in the sequel. Interpreting
into a favourable hesitation her silence, which
was the result of wrath and amazement, he
proceeded to throw himself at her feet, and
utter a romantic rhapsody, in the course of
which, laying aside all that restraint which he
had hitherto preserved, he seized her delicate
hand, and pressed it to his lips; nay, so far
did he forget himself on this occasion, that
he caught the fair creature in his arms, and
rudely ravished a kiss from those lips which
he had before contemplated with the most distant
reverence of desire. 
Having thus broken down the fences of decorum,
and being heated with transport, he,
in all probability, would have acted the part
of young Tarquin, and violated, by force,
that sacred shrine of honour, beauty, and
unblemished truth, had not the wrath kindled
by such an unexpected outrage, inspired
her with strength and spirits sufficient to protect
her virtue, and intimidate the ruffian who
could offer violence to such perfection. She
broke from his detested embrace, with surprising
agility, and called aloud to her landlady
for assistance; but that discreet matron was resolved
to hear nothing, and Fathom's appetite
being whetted to a most brutal degree of eagerness,
“Madam, (said he) all opposition is
vain; what you have refused to my intreaties, 

you shall yield to my power; and I am determined
to force you to your own advantage.” 
So saying, he sprung towards her, with the
most savage and impious intent, when this amiable
heroine snatched up his sword, which
lay upon a by-table, and unsheathing it instantaneously,
presented the point to his breast,
and while her eyes glanced with intolerable
keenness, “Villain! (cried she) the spirit of
my father animates my bosom, and the vengeance
of heaven shall not be frustrated.” He
was not so much affected by his bodily danger,
as awe-struck at the manner of her address,
and the appearance of her aspect, which seemed
to shine with something supernatural, and
actually disordered his whole faculties, insomuch
that he retreated without attempting to
make the least reply; and she having secured
the door after his departure, sat down to ponder
upon this shocking event. 
Words are wanting to describe the accumulated
horrors that took possession of her mind,
when she thus beheld all her presaging fears
realized, and found herself at the mercy of
two wretches, who had now pulled off the
mask, after having lost all sentiments of humanity. 
Common affliction was an agreeable
reverie to what she suffered, deprived of her
parents, exiled from her friends and country,
reduced to the brink of wanting the most
indispensible necessaries of life, in a foreign
land, where she knew not one person to whose
protection she could have recourse, from the
inexpressible woes that environed her; she
complained to heaven, that her life was protracted
for the augmentation of that misery 

which was already too severe to be endured; 
for she shuddered at the prospect of being utterly
abandoned in the last stage of mortality,
without one friend to close her eyes, or do the
last offices of humanity to her breathless
coarse. These were dreadful reflections to a
young lady who had been born to affluence
and splendor, trained up in all the elegance of
education, by nature fraught with that sensibility
which refines the sentiment and taste,
and so tenderly cherished by her indulgent parents,
that they suffered not the winds of heaven
to visit her face too roughly. 
Having passed the night in such agony, she
rose at day-break, and hearing the chapel-bell
toll for morning prayers, resolved to go
to this place of worship, in order to implore
the assistance of heaven: she no sooner opened
her chamber door, with this intent, than
she was met by Madam la Mer, who after having
professed her concern for what had happened
over night, and imputed Mr Fathom's
rudeness to the spirit of intoxication, by which
she had never before seen him possessed, she
endeavoured to dissuade Monimia from her
purpose, by observing, that her health would
be prejudiced by the cold morning air; but
finding her determined, she insisted upon accompanying
her to chapel, on pretence of respect,
though, in reality,with a view to prevent
the escape of her beauteous lodger. Thus attended, the hapless mourner entered
the place, and according to the laudable hospitality
of England, which is the only country
in Christendom, where a stranger is not
made welcome to the house of God; this amiable 

creature, emaciated and enfeebled as
she was, must have stood in a common passage
during the whole service, had not she
been perceived by a humane gentlewoman,
who, struck with her beauty and dignified air,
and melted with sympathy, at the ineffable
sorrow which was visible in her countenance,
opened the pew in which she sat, and accommodated
Monimia and her attendant: if she
was captivated by her first appearance, she was
not less affected by the deportment of her fair
guest, which was the pattern of genuine devotion. 
In a word, this good lady, who was a merchant's
widow in opulent circumstances, was
inflamed with a longing desire to know and
befriend the amiable stranger, who, after service,
turning about to thank her for her civility,
Madam Clement, with that frankness
which is the result of true benevolence, told
her, she was too much prepossessed in her favour,
to let slip this opportunity of craving her
acquaintance, and of expressing her inclination
to alleviate (if possible) that affliction
which was manifest in her looks. 
Monimia, overwhelmed with gratitude and
surprize, at this unexpected address, gazed upon
the lady in silence, and when she repeated her
tenders of service, could make no other reply
to her goodness, than by bursting into a flood
of tears: This was a species of eloquence, which
did not pass unregarded by Madam Clement,
who, while her own eyes were bedewed with
the drops of sympathy and compassion, took
the lovely orphan by the hand, and led her,
without further ceremony, to her own coach, 

that stood waiting at the door, whither they
were followed by Mrs La Mer, who was so
much confounded at the adventure, that she
made no objections to the proposal of the lady
who handed her lodger into the carriage; but
retired, with all possible dispatch, to make Fathom
acquainted with this unforeseen event. 
Mean while, the agitation of Monimia, at
this providential deliverance, was such as had
well nigh destroyed her tender frame: the
blood flushed and forsook her cheeks by turns; 
she trembled from head to foot, notwithstanding
the consolatory assurances of Madam Clement,
and, without being able to utter one
word, was conducted to the house of that kind
benefactress, where the violence of her transports
overpowered her constitution, and she
sunk down upon a couch in a swoon, from
which she was not easily recovered. This affecting
circumstance augmented the pity, and
interested the curiosity of Madam Clement,
who concluded there was something very extraordinary
in the case of the stranger, to produce
these agonies; and grew impatient to
hear the particulars of her story. 
Monimia no sooner retrieved the use of her
faculties, than looking around, and observing
with what humane concern her new hostess
was employed in effecting her recovery “Is
this (said she) a flattering illusion of the brain?
or am I really under the protection of some
beneficient being, whom heaven hath inspired
with generosity, to rescue an hapless stranger
from the most forlorn state of misery and
woe?” Her voice was, at all times, ravishingly
sweet; and this exclamation was pronounced 

with such pathetic fervour, that Madam Clement
clasped her in her arms, and kissing her
with all the eagerness of maternal affection,
“ Yes, (cried she) fair creature, heaven hath
bestowed upon me an heart to compassionate,
and power, I hope, to lighten the burthen of
your sorrows.” 
She then prevailed upon her to take some
nourishment, and afterwards to recount the
particulars of her fate; a task she performed
with such accuracy and candour, that Madam
Clement, far from suspecting her sincerity, saw
truth and conviction in every circumstance of
her tale; and having condoled her misfortunes,
entreated her to forget them, or, at least,
look upon herself as one sheltered under the
care and tuition of a person, whose study it
would be to supply her want of natural parents. 
This would have been an happy vicissitude of
fortune, had it not arrived too late; but such
a sudden and unlooked for transition, not only
disordered the faculties of poor Monimia's
mind, but also overpowered the organs of her
body, already fatigued and enfeebled by the
distresses she had undergone; so that she was
taken ill of a fever that same night, and became
delirious before morning, when a physician was
called to her assistance. 
While this gentleman was in the house, Madam
Clement was visited by Fathom, who after
having complained, in the most insinuating
manner, that she had encouraged his wife to
abandon her duty, told her a plausible story of
his first acquaintance with Monimia, and his
marriage at the Fleet, which, he said, he was
ready to prove, by the evidence of the clergyman 

who joined them, and that of Mrs la Mer
who was present at the ceremony. The good
lady, although a little staggered at the genteel
appearance, and engaging address of this stranger,
could not prevail upon herself to believe
that she had been imposed upon by her fair
lodger, who, by this time, had given too convincing
a proof of her sincerity; nevertheless,
in order to prevent any dispute that might be
prejudicial to the health or recovery of Monimia,
she gave him to understand, that she
would not, at present, enter upon the merits of
the cause, but only assure him, that the young
lady was actually bereft of her senses, and in
imminent danger of her life: for the truth of
which assertions she would appeal to his own
observation, and the opinion of the physician,
who was then employ'd in writing a prescription
for the cure of her disease. 
So saying, she conducted him into the chamber,
where he beheld the hapless virgin stretched
upon a sick bed, panting under the violence
of a distemper too mighty for her weakly
frame, her hair dishevelled, and discomposure
in her looks; all the roses of her youth were
faded, yet all the graces of her beauty were
not fled: she retained that sweetness and symmetry,
which death itself could not destroy; 
and though her discourse was incoherent, her
voice was still musical, resembling those feathered
songsters who warble their native wood-notes
wild. 
Fathom, as upon all other occasions, so on
this, did behave like an inimitable actor; he
ran to the bed-side, with all the trepidation of
a distracted lover; he fell upon his knees, and 

while the tears rolled down his cheeks, imprinted
a thousand kisses on the soft hand of
Monimia, who regarding him with a lack
lustre, and undistinguishing eye, “Alas! Renaldo,
(said she) we were born to be unhappy.” 
“Would to heaven! (cried Ferdinand in a
transport of grief) the wretch Renaldo had never
been born! that is the villain who seduced
the affections of this unfortunate woman. I
admitted the traitor into my friendship and
confidence, relieved him in his necessities; and,
like the ungrateful viper, he hath stung the
very bosom that cherished him in his distress. 
Then he proceeded to inform Madam Clement,
how he had delivered that same Renaldo
from prison, maintained him afterwards at
a great expence, and, at length, furnished him
with a sum of money, and proper credentials
to support his interest at the court of Vienna. 
Having finished this detail, he asked the
physician's sentiments of his wife's distemper,
and being told, that her life was in extreme
jeopardy, begged he would use his utmost endeavours
in her behalf, and even made him a
tender of an extraordinary fee; which was refused:
he also thanked Madam Clement for
her charity and benevolence towards a stranger,
and took his leave, with many polite professions
of gratitude and esteem. He had no
sooner quitted the house, than the physician,
who was a humane man, and a foreigner, began
to caution the lady against his insinuations,
observing, that some circumstances of the
story concerning Renaldo, were, to his particular
knowledge, contrary to truth: for that
he himself had been applied to for letters of 

recommendation, in behalf of Count Melvil,
by a Jew merchant of his acquaintance, who
had supplied the young gentleman with money
sufficient for his occasions, in consequence of
a minute inquiry he had made into the character
of Renaldo, who was, by all reports, a
youth of strict honour and untainted morals. 
Madam Clement, thus cautioned, entered into
deliberation with her own thoughts, and
comparing the particulars of this account with
those of Monimia's own story, she concluded,
that Fathom was the very traitor he himself
had described; and that he had, by abusing
the confidence of both, effected a fatal breach
between two innocent and deserving lovers. 
She accordingly looked upon him with horror
and detestation; but, nevertheless, resolved to
treat him with civility in the mean time, that
the poor young lady might not be disturbed in
her last moments; for she had now lost all
hopes of her recovery. Yet the fever abated,
and in two days she retrieved the use of her
reason: though the distemper had affected her
lungs, and she was in all appearance doomed
to linger a few weeks longer in a consumption. 
Fathom was punctual in his visitation, tho'
never admitted into her presence after the delirium
vanished; and he had the opportunity
of seeing her conveyed in a chariot to Kensington
Gravel-pits, a place which may be termed
the last stage of many a mortal peregrination. 
He now implicitly believed, that death would
in a few days baffle all his designs upon the unfortunate
Monimia; and foreseeing, that, as
he had owned himself her husband, he might 

be obliged to defray the expence incurred by
her sickness and burial, he very prudently intermitted
in his visits, and had recourse to the
intelligence of his auxiliary. 
As for Monimia, she approached the goal
of life; not simply with resignation, but with
rapture: she enjoyed, in tranquillity, the conversation
of her kind benefactress, who never
stirred from her apartment; she was blessed
with the spiritual consolation of a worthy clergyman,
who removed all her religious scruples; 
and she congratulated herself on the near prospect
of that land of peace where sorrow is not
known. 
At length Mrs la Mer gave notice to our
adventurer of this amiable young lady's decease,
and the time fixed for the interment:
upon which these two virtuous associates took
possession of a place, from whence they could,
unperceived, behold the funeral. He must
have a hard heart, who, without an emotion
of pity, can see the last offices performed to a
young creature cut off in the flower of youth
and beauty, even though he knows not her
name, and is an utter stranger to her virtues. 
How callous then must the soul of that wretch
have been, who, without a symptom of remorse
or concern, saw the sable hearse adorned with
white plumes, as emblems of Monimia's purity,
pass before him, while her incomparable merit
stood full in his remembrance, and he knew
himself the wicked cause of her untimely fate! 
Perfidious wretch! thy crimes turn out so
attrocious, that I half repent me of having
undertaken to record thy memoirs: yet such
monsters ought to be exhibited to public view, 

that mankind may be upon their guard against
imposture; that the world may see how fraud
is apt to overshoot itself: and that, as virtue,
though it may suffer for a while, will triumph
in the end; so iniquity, though it may prosper
for a season, will at last be overtaken by that
punishment and disgrace which are its due.
