Why does not my sweet Girl subscribe Sister,
as usual? I have done nothing amiss to you! 
I love you dearly, and ever will. I can't help my 

Brother's Faults. But I hope he uses you with Politeness
and Decency. He shall be none of my Brother,
if he don't. I rest a great deal upon your
Prudence, and it will be very meritorious, if you
can overcome yourself, so as to act unexceptionably,
tho' it may not be deserv'd, on this Occasion: For in
doing so, you'll have a Triumph over Nature itself; 
for, my dear Girl, as you have formerly own'd, you
have a little Touch *  of Jealousy in your Composition. 
What I have heard, is no Secret to any body. 
The injured Party is generally the last that hears in
these Cases, and you shall not first be told any
thing by me that must afflict you, but cannot you,
more than it does me. God give you Patience and
Comfort! The wicked Lady has a deal to answer
for, to disturb such an uncommon Happiness. But
no more, than that I am 
Your ever affectionate Sister,
B. Davers. 
I am all Impatience to hear how you conduct
yourself on this trying Occasion. Let me know
what you have heard, and how you came to
hear it.
