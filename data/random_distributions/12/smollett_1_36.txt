He repairs to Bristol spring, where he reigns
Paramount during the whole season. 
We shall therefore leave her in this comfortable
situation, and return to our adventurer,
whose appearance at Bristol was considered
as a happy omen by the proprietor of
the hot-well, and all the people who live by
the resort of company to that celebrated
spring. Nor were they deceived in their prognostic; 
Fathom, as usual, formed the nucleus
or kernel of the beau monde; and the season
soon became so crouded, that many people of
fashion were obliged to quit the place for want
of lodging. Ferdinand was the soul that animated
the whole society. He not only invented
parties of pleasure, but also, by his personal
talents, rendered them more agreeable: In a
word, he regulated their diversions, and the
master of the ceremonies never would allow
the ball to be begun, untill the count was seated. 
Having thus made himself the object of admiration 

and esteem, his advice was an oracle
to which they had recourse in all doubtful
cases of punctilio or dispute, or even of medicine; 
for among his other accomplishments,
his discourse on that subject was so plausible,
and well adapted to the understanding of his
hearers, that any person who had not actually
studied the medical art, would have believed he
was inspired by the spirit of Æsculapius. What
contributed to the aggrandizement of his character
in this branch of knowledge, was a victory
he obtained over an old physician, who
plied at the well, and had one day unfortunately
begun to harrangue in the pump-room, upon
the nature of the Bristol-water; in the course
of this lecture, he undertook to account for the
warmth of the fluid; and his ideas being perplexed
with a great deal of reading, which he
had not been able to digest, his disquisition was
so indistinct, and his expression so obscure and
unentertaining, that our hero seized the opportunity
of displaying his own erudition, by
venturing to contradict some circumstances
of the doctor's hypothesis, and substituting a
theory of his own, which, as he had invented
it for the purpose, was equally amusing and
chimerical. 
He alledged, that fire was the sole vivifying
principle that pervaded all nature; that as the
heat of the sun concocted the juice of vegetables
and ripened those fruits that grow upon
the surface of this globe, there was likewise an
immense store of central fire reserved within
the bowels of the earth, not only for the generation
of gems, fossils, and all the purposes
of the mineral world: but likewise, for cherishing 

and keeping alive those plants which
would otherwise perish by the winter's cold. 
The existence of such a fire, he proved from
the nature of all those volcanos, which in
almost every corner of the earth, are continually
vomiting up either flames or smoke. 
“These,” said he, “are the great vents appointed
by nature, for the discharge of that
rarified air, and combustible matter, which, if
confined, would burst the globe asunder; but
besides the larger outlets, there are some small
chimnies through which part of the heat transpires; 
a vapour of that sort, I conceve, must
pass through the bed or channel of this spring,
the waters of which, accordingly, retain a moderate
warmth.” 
This account, which totally overthrew the
other's doctrine, was so extremely agreeable to
the audience, that the testy doctor lost his temper,
and gave them to understand without preamble,
that he must be a person wholly ignorant
of natural philosophy, who could invent
such a ridiculous system, and they involved in
worse than an Ægyptian fog, that could not at
once discern its weakness and absurdity. This
declaration introduced a dispute, which was
unanimously determined in favour of our adventurer. 
On all such occasions, the stream
of prejudice runs against the physician, even
tho' his antagonist has nothing to recommend
himself to the favour of the spectators: and this
decision depends upon divers considerations; 
in the first place, there is a continual war carried
on against the learned professions, by
all those who, conscious of their own ignorance,
seek to level the reputation of their superiors, 

with their own. Secondly, in all disputes
upon physic, that happen betwixt a person
who really understands the art, and an illiterate
pretender, the arguments of the first
will seem obscure and unintelligible to those
who are unacquainted with the previous systems
on which they are built; while the other's
theory, derived from common notions, and superficial
observation, will be more agreeable,
because better adapted to the comprehension
of the hearers. Thirdly, the judgment of the
multitude is apt to be biassed by that surprize,
which is the effect of seeing an artist foiled at
his own weapons, by one who engages him only
for amusement. 
Fathom, besides these advantages, was blessed
with a flow of language, an elegant address,
a polite and self-denying stile of argumentation,
together with a temper not to be
ruffled; so that the victory could not long
waver between him and the physician, to whom
he was infinitely superior in every acquisition
but that of solid learning, of which the judges
had no idea. This contest was not only
glorious, but profitable to our adventurer,
who grew into such request in his medical capacity,
that the poor doctor was utterly deserted
by his patients, and Fathom's advice
sollicited by every valetudinarian in the
place; nor did he forfeit the character he
thus acquired, by any miscarriages in his practice; 
being but little conversant with the Materia
medica, the circle of his prescriptions
was very small: his chief study was to avoid
all drugs of rough operation, and uncertain
effect; and to administer such only as should 

be agreeable to the palate, without doing violence
to the constitution. Such a physician
could not but be agreeable to people of all
dispositions; and as most of the patients were
in some shape hypochondriac, the power of
imagination co-operating with his remedies,
often effected a cure. 
On the whole, it became the fashion to consult
the count in all distempers, and his reputation
would have had its run, though the
death of every patient had given the lie to his
pretensions. But empty fame was not the
sole fruit of his success. Though no person
would presume to affront this noble graduate
with a fee; they did not fail to manifest their
gratitude by some more valuable present:
every day some superb piece of china, curious
snuff-box or jewel was pressed upon him; so
that at the end of the season, he could almost
have furnished a toy shop, with the acknowledgements
he had received: not only his avarice
but his pleasure was gratified in the course
of his medical administration. He enjoyed
free access, egress and regress, with all the females
at the well, and no matron scrupled to
put her daughter under his care and direction. 
These opportunities could not be lost upon a
man of his intriguing genius; though he conducted
his amours with such discretion, that
during the whole season, no lady's character
suffered on his account: yet he was highly
fortunate in his addresses; and we may venture
to affirm, that the reproach of barrenness
was more than once removed by the vigour
of his endeavours.
