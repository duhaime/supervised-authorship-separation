Miss Clarissa Harlowe, To Miss Howe. 

Tuesday, May 2. 
With infinite regret I am obliged to tell you,
that I can no longer write to you, or receive
letters from you. Your mother has sent me a letter
inclosed in a cover to Mr. Lovelace, directed for him
at Lord M.'s (and which was brought him just now),
reproaching me on this subject in very angry terms,
and forbidding me, as I would not be thought to intend
to make her and you unhappy, to write to you,
without her leave. 
This, therefore, is the last you must receive from
me, till happier times: And as my prospects are not
very bad, I presume we shall soon have leave to write 

again; and even to see each other! Since an alliance
with a family so honourable as Mr. Lovelace's is, will
not be a disgrace. 
She is pleased to write, that if I would wish to inflame
you, I should let you know her written prohibition: 
But otherwise find some way of my own accord
(without bringing her into the question) to decline a
correspondence, which I must know she has for some
time past forbidden. But all I can say, is, to beg of
you not to be inflamed;â€”to beg of you, not to let
her know, or even by your behaviour to her, on this
occasion, guess, that I have acquainted you with my
reason for declining to write to you. For how else,
after the scruples I have heretofore made on this very
subject, yet proceeding to correspond, can I honestly
satisfy you about my motives for this sudden stop? 
So, my dear, I choose, you see, rather to rely upon
your discretion, than to feign reasons you would not
be satisfy'd with, but, with your usual active penetration,
sift to the bottom, and at last find me to be a
mean and low qualifier; and that, with an implication
injurious to you, that I supposed you had not prudence
enough to be trusted with the naked truth. 
I repeat, that my prospects are not bad. The house,
I presume, will soon be taken. The people here are
very respectful, notwithstanding my nicety about
Miss Partington. Miss Martin, who is near marriage
with an eminent tradesman in the Strand, just
now, in a very respectful manner, asked my opinion
of some patterns of rich silks for the occasion. The
widow has a less forbidding appearance than at first. 
Mr. Lovelace, on my declared dislike of his four
friends, has assured me, that neither they nor anybody
else shall be introduced to me, without my leave. 
These circumstances I mention, as you will suppose,
that your kind heart may be at ease about me; 
that you may be induced by them to acquiesce with
your mother's commands, chearfully acquiesce, and 

that for my sake, lest I should be thought an inflamer; 
who am, with very contrary intentions, my dearest,
and best-beloved friend. 
Your ever-obliged and affectionate,
Clarissa Halowe.
