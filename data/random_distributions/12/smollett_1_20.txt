He puts himself under the guidance of his associate,
and stumbles upon the French camp,
where he finishes his military career. 
Nothing else of moment was transacted
during that campaign; and in the winter,
our adventurer, with the young count,
and his friend the Tyrolese, were disposed in
quarters of cantonment, where Ferdinand
made himself amends for the chagrin he had
undergone, by the exercise of those talents in
which he excelled. Not that he was satisfied
with the sphere of life in which he acted; 
though he knew himself consummate in the
art of play, he was not at all ambitious of a
gamester's name; nor did he find himself disposed
to hazard those discoveries and explanations
to which heroes of that class are sometimes
necessarily exposed. His aim was to 

dwell among the tents of civil life, undisturbed
by quarrels and the din of war, and render
mankind subservient to his interest, not by
stratagems which irritate, but by that suppleness
of insinuation, which could not fail to
sooth the temper of those on whom he meant
to prey. 
He saw that all his expectations of count
Melvile's future favour, were connected with
his choice of a military life; and that his promotion
in the service would, in a great measure,
depend upon his personal behaviour in
such emergencies as he did not at all wish to
encounter. On the other hand, he confided
so much in his own dexterity and address, that
he never doubted of being able to rear a splendid
fortune for himself, provided he could
once obtain a fixed and firm foundation. He
had in fancy, often enjoyed a prospect of England,
not only as his native country, to which,
like a true citizen, he longed to be united; 
but also as the land of promise, flowing with
milk and honey, and abounding with subjects
on which he knew his talents would be properly
exercised. 
These reflections never occurred, without
leaving a strong impression upon the mind of
our adventurer, which influenced his deliberations,
in such a manner, as at length amounted
to a perfect resolution of withdrawing himself
privately from a service that teemed with
disagreeable events; and of transporting himself
into the country of his ancestors, which he
considered as the Canaan of all able adventurers. 
But previous to his appearance on that
stage, he was desirous of visiting the metropolis 

of France, in which he hoped to improve
himself in the knowledge of men and things,
and acquire such intelligence as would qualify
him to act a more important part upon the
British scene. After having for some time indulged
these prospects in secret, he determined
to accommodate himself with the company
and experience of the Tyrolese, whom, under
the specious title of an associate, he knew
he could convert into a very serviceable tool,
in forwarding the execution of his own projects. 
Accordingly, the inclination of this confederate
was founded by distant hints, and being
found apt, our hero made him privy to
his design of decamping without beat of drum; 
though, at the same time, he begged his advice,
touching the method of their departure,
that he might retire with as much delicacy as
the nature of such a step would permit. Divers
consultations were held upon this subject,
before they adhered to the resolution of making
their escape from the army, after it should
have taken the field in the spring; because, in
that case, they would have frequent opportunities
of going abroad on foraging parties, and
during one of these excursions, might retire
in such a manner, as to persuade their
companions, that they had fallen into the enemy's
hands. 
Agreeable to this determination, the camp
was no sooner formed in Alsace, than our associates
began to make preparations for their
march, and had already taken all the previous
measures for their departure, when an accident
happened, which our hero did not fail to convert 

to his own advantage: this was no other
than the desertion of Renaldo's valet, who, in
consequence of a gentle chastisement, which he
had richly merited, thought proper to disappear,
after having plundered his master's portmanteau,
which he had forced open for the purpose. 
Ferdinand, who was the first person
that discovered the theft, immediately comprehended
the whole adventure, and taking it
for granted, that the delinquent would never
return, resolved to finish what the fugitive had
imperfectly performed. 
Being favoured with the unreserved confidence
of the young count, he instantly had
recourse to his bureau, the locks of which he
found means to burst open, and examining a
private drawer, contrived with great art to
conceal Renaldo's jewels and cash, made himself
master of the contents without hesitation; 
then cutting open his cloak-bag, and strewing
the tent with his linen and cloaths, began to
raise his voice, and produced such a clamour as
alarmed the whole neighbourhood, and
brought a great many officers into the tent. 
He on this, as on all other occasions, performed
his cue to a miracle, expressing confusion
and concern so naturally, in his gestures
and exclamation, that no man could possibly
suspect his sincerity; nay, to such a degree of
finesse did his cunning amount, that when his
friend and patron entered, in consequence of
an intimation he soon received of his loss, our
adventurer exhibited undoubted signs of distraction
and delirium, and springing upon Renaldo
with all the frantic fury of a bedlamite,
“Villain,” cried he, “restore the effects you 

have stole from your master, or you shall be
immediately committed to the care of the
Prêvot.” However mortified M. de Melvile
might be, at his own misfortune, the condition
of his friend seemed to touch him more nearly; 
he undervalued his own loss, as a trifle that
could be easily repaired, said every thing which
he thought would tend to sooth and compose
the agitation of Ferdinand, and finally prevailed
upon him to retire to rest. The calamity
was wholly attributed to the deserter, and Renaldo,
far from suspecting the true author,
took occasion, from his behaviour on this emergency,
to admire him as a mirrour of integrity
and attachment; in such an exquisite
manner did he plan all his designs, that almost
every instance of his fraud furnished matter of
triumph to his reputation. 
Having thus profitably exercised his genius,
this subtle politician thought it high time to
relinquish his military expectations, and securing
all his valuable acquisitions about his own
person, rode out with his understrapper, in the
midst of fifty dragoons who went in quest of
forage. While the troopers were employed in
making up their trusses, the two adventurers
advanced towards the skirt of a wood, on pretence
of reconnoitering, and the Tyroleze, who
undertook to be our hero's guide, directing him
to a path which led towards Strasburg, they
suddenly vanished from the eyes of their companions,
who in a few minutes hearing the report
of several pistols, which the confederates
purposely fired, conjectured that they had fallen
in with a party of French, by whom they
were made prisoners of war. 

The Tyroleze had over-rated his own knowlege,
when he took upon himself the charge of
conducting our hero; for, upon their arrival
at a certain place, where two roads crossed each
other, he chanced to follow that which not
only frustrated their intention, but even led
them directly to the French camp: so that in
the twilight they fell in upon one of the outguards,
before they were aware of their mistake. 
Whatever confusion and perplexity they might
undergo, when they heard themselves questioned
by the centinel on the advanced post, certain
it is, they betrayed no symptoms of fear or disorder; 
but while Ferdinand endeavoured to
recollect himself, his fellow traveller, with the
appearance of admirable intrepidity and presence
of mind, told the soldier, that he and
his companion were two gentlemen of family,
who had quitted the Austrian army, on account
of having sustained some ill usage, which
they had no opportunity of resenting in any
other way; and that they were come to offer
their services to the French general, to whose
quarters they desired to be immediately conveyed. 
The centinel, to whom such an instance of
desertion was neither rare, nor indeed uncommon,
directed them without scruple to the next
post, where they found a serjeant's party, from
which, at their request, they were transmitted
to the officer of the grand guard, and by him,
next morning, introduced to count Coigny,
who very politely received them as volunteers
in the army of France. Though this translation
was not at all to our hero's liking, he was
forced to acquiesce in his fate, glad to find himself, 

on these terms, in possession of his effects,
of which he would otherwise have been infallibly
rifled. 
This campaign, however, was the most disagreeable
period of his whole life; because the
manner in which he had entered into the service,
subjected him to the particular observation
and notice of the French officers; so that he
was obliged to be very alert in his duty, and
summon all his fortitude to maintain the character
he had assumed. What rendered his
situation still more unpalateable, was the activity
of both armies in the course of this season,
during which, over and above sundry fatiguing
marches and counter-marches, he was
personally engaged in the affair of Hallch, which
was very obstinate, where being in the skirts
of the detachment, he was actually wounded
in the face by the sword of an hussar; but this
was, luckily for him, the last time he found
himself under the necessity of exerting his military
prowess; for a cessation of arms was proclaimed,
before he was cured of his wound,
and peace concluded about the end of the campaign. 
During his sojourn in the French Camp, he
assumed the character of a man of family, who
being disgusted at some supercilious treatment
he had met with in the German service, and
at the same time ambitious of carrying arms
under the banners of France, took the opportunity
of retreating by stealth from his friends,
accompanied only by one with whom he could
intrust his intention. In this capacity, he had
managed his matters to such advantage, that
many French officers of rank were very well 

disposed to contribute their interest in his behalf,
had his inclination verged towards promotion
in the army; but he thought proper
to conceal his real design, under the specious
pretext of longing to see the metropolis of
France, that centre of pleasure and politeness,
in which he proposed to spend some time for
the improvement of his address and understanding. 
These were motives too laudable to
be opposed by his new patrons, some of whom
furnished him with letters of recommendation
to certain noblemen of the first rank at the
court of Versailles, for which place he and his
companion set out from the banks of the
Rhine, very well satisfied with the honourable
dismission they had obtained from a life of inconvenience,
danger and alarm.
