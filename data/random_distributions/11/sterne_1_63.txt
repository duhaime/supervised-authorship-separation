The man who either disdains or
fears to walk up a dark entry
may be an excellent good man, and
fit for a hundred things; but he will
not do to make a good sentimental
traveller. I count little of the many
things I see pass at broad noon day
in large and open streets. —Nature
is shy, and hates to act before
spectators; but in such an unobserved
corner, you sometimes see a
single short scene of her's worth all
the sentiments of a dozen French
plays compounded together—and yet 

they are absolutely fine;—and whenever
I have a more brilliant affair
upon my hands than common, as
they suit a preacher just as well as a
hero, I generally make my sermon
out of 'em—and for the text—“Capadosia,
Pontus and Asia, Phrygia
and Pamphilia”—is as good as any
one in the Bible. 
There is a long dark passage issuing
out from the opera comique into
a narrow street; 'tis trod by a few
who humbly wait for a fiacre* , or
wish to get off quietly o'foot when the
opera is done. At the end of it, towards
the theatre, 'tis lighted by a small candle, 

the light of which is almost lost before
you get half-way down, but near
the door—'tis more for ornament
than use: you see it as a fix'd star of
the least magnitude; it burns—but
does little good to the world that we
know of. 
In returning along this passage, I
discern'd, as I approach'd within five
or six paces of the door, two ladies
standing arm in arm, with their backs
against the wall, waiting, as I imagined,
for a fiacre—as they were next
the door, I thought they had a prior
right; so edged myself up within a
yard or little more of them, and
quietly took my stand—I was in
black, and scarce seen. 

The lady next me was a tall lean
figure of a woman of about thirty-six; 
the other of the same size and make,
of about forty; there was no mark
of wife or widow in any one part of
either of them—they seem'd to be
two upright vestal sisters, unsapp'd
by caresses, unbroke in upon by
tender salutations: I could have
wish'd to have made them happy— 
their happiness was destin'd, that
night, to come from another quarter. 
A low voice, with a good turn of
expression, and sweet cadence at the
end of it, begg'd for a twelve-sous
piece betwixt them, for the love of
heaven. I thought it singular, that 

a beggar should fix the quota of an
alms—and that the sum should be
twelve times as much as what is usually
given in the dark. They both seemed
astonish'd as it as much as myself. — 
Twelve sous! said one—A twelve-sous
piece! said the other—and made no
reply. 
The poor man said, He knew not
how to ask less of ladies of their
rank, and bow'd down his head to
the ground. 
Poo! said they, we have no
money. 
The beggar remained silent for a
moment or two, and renew'd his supplication. 

Do not, my fair young ladies, said
he, stop your good ears against me
—Upon my word, honest man! said
the younger, we have no change— 
Then God bless you, said the poor
man, and multiply those joys which
you can give to others without
change! —I observed the elder sister
put her hand into her pocket—I'll
see, said she, if I have a sous. —A
sous! give twelve, said the supplicant
Nature has been bountiful to
you, be bountiful to a poor man. 
I would, friend, with all my heart,
said the younger, if I had it. 
My fair charitable! said he,
addressing himself to the elder— 

What is it but your goodness and humanity
which makes your bright
eyes so sweet, that they outshine
the morning even in this dark
passage? and what was it which
made the Marquis de Santerre and
his brother say so much of you both
as they just pass'd by? 
The two ladies seemed much affected; 
and impulsively at the same
time they both put their hands into
their pocket, and each took out a
twelve-sous piece. 
The contest betwixt them and the
poor supplicant was no more—it was
continued betwixt themselves, which 

of the two should give the twelve-sous
piece in charity—and to end the
dispute, they both gave it together,
and the man went away.
