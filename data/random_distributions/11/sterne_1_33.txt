When the barber came, he
absolutely refused to have
any thing to do with my wig: 'twas
either above or below his art: I
had nothing to do, but to take one
ready made of his own recommendation. 
—But I fear, friend! said I, this
buckle won't stand. —You may immerge
it, replied he, into the ocean,
and it will stand— 
What a great scale is every thing
upon in this city! thought I —The 

utmost stretch of an English periwig-maker's
ideas could have gone no
further than to have “dipped it into
a pail of water” —What difference!
'tis like time to eternity. 
I confess I do hate all cold conceptions,
as I do the puny ideas
which engender them; and am generally
so struck with the great
works of nature, that for my own
part, if I could help it, I never
would make a comparison less than a
mountain at least. All that can be
said against the French sublime in
this instance of it, is this—that the
grandeur is more in the word; and
less in the thing. No doubt the
ocean fills the mind with vast ideas; 

but Paris being so far inland, it was
not likely I should run post a
hundred miles out of it, to try the
experiment—the Parisian barber
meant nothing.— 
The pail of water standing besides
the great deep, makes certainly but
a sorry figure in speech—but 'twill
be said—it has one advantage—'tis
in the next room, and the truth of
the buckle may be tried in it without
more ado, in a single moment. 
In honest truth, and upon a more
candid revision of the matter, The
French expression professes more than it
performs. 

I think I can see the precise and
distinguishing marks of national characters
more in these nonsensical minutiæ,
than in the most important
matters of state; where great men of
all nations talk and stalk so much
alike, that I would not give nine-pence
to chuse amongst them. 
I was so long in getting from
under my barber's hands, that it
was too late of thinking of going
with my letter to Madame R*** 
that night: but when a man is once
dressed at all points for going out,
his reflections turn to little account,
so taking down the name of the
Hotel de Modene where I lodged, I 

walked forth without any determination
where to go —I shall consider
of that, said I, as I walk along.
