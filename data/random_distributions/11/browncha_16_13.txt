Order could not readily be introduced into my
thoughts. The voice &longs;till rung in my ears. Every
accent that was uttered by Carwin was fre&longs;h in my
remembrance. His unwelcome approach, the recognition
of his per&longs;on, his ha&longs;ty departure, pro&longs;
duced a complex impre&longs;&longs;ion on my mind which no
words can delineate. I &longs;trove to give a &longs;lower motion
to my thoughts, and to regulate a confu&longs;ion
which became painful; but my efforts were nugatory.
I covered my eyes with my hand, and &longs;at,
I know not how long, without power to arrange or
utter my conceptions.
I had remained for hours, as I believed, in absolute
&longs;olitude. No thought of per&longs;onal danger
had mole&longs;ted my tranquillity. I had made no preparation
for defence. What was it that &longs;ugge&longs;ted
the de&longs;ign of peru&longs;ing my father's manu&longs;cript? If,
in&longs;tead of this, I had retired to bed, and to &longs;leep,
to what fate might I not have been re&longs;erved? The
ruffian, who mu&longs;t almo&longs;t have &longs;uppre&longs;&longs;ed his breathings
to &longs;creen him&longs;elf from di&longs;covery, would have
noticed this &longs;ignal, and I &longs;hould have awakened
only to peri&longs;h with affright, and to abhor my&longs;elf.
Could I have remained uncon&longs;cious of my danger?
Could I have tranquilly &longs;lept in the mid&longs;t of &longs;o
deadly a &longs;nare?
And who was he that threatened to de&longs;troy me?
By what means could he hide him&longs;elf in this clo&longs;et?
Surely he is gifted with &longs;upernatural power. Such
is the enemy of who&longs;e attempts I was forewarned.
Daily I had &longs;een him and conver&longs;ed with him.





Nothing could be di&longs;cerned through the impenetrable
veil of his duplicity. When bu&longs;ied in conjectures,
as to the author of the evil that was threatened, my
mind did not light, for a moment, upon his image.
Yet has he not avowed him&longs;elf my enemy? Why
&longs;hould he be here if he had not meditated evil?
He confe&longs;&longs;es that this has been his &longs;econd attempt.
What was the &longs;cene of his former conspiracy?
Was it not he who&longs;e whi&longs;pers betrayed
him? Am I deceived; or was there not a faint resemblance
between the voice of this man and that
which talked of gra&longs;ping my throat, and extinguishing
my life in a moment? Then he had a colleague
in his crime; now he is alone. Then death was
the &longs;cope of his thoughts; now an injury unspeakably
more dreadful. How thankful &longs;hould I be to
the power that has interpo&longs;ed to &longs;ave me!
That power is invi&longs;ible. It is &longs;ubject to the cognizance
of one of my &longs;en&longs;es. What are the means
that will inform me of what nature it is? He has
&longs;et him&longs;elf to counterwork the machinations of this
man, who had menaced de&longs;truction to all that is
dear to me, and who&longs;e cunning had &longs;urmounted
every human impediment. There was none to
re&longs;cue me from his gra&longs;p. My ra&longs;hne&longs;s even hastened
the completion of his &longs;cheme, and precluded
him from the benefits of deliberation. I had robbed
him of the power to repent and forbear. Had I
been apprized of the danger, I &longs;hould have regarded
my conduct as the means of rendering my e&longs;cape
from it impo&longs;&longs;ible. Such, likewi&longs;e, &longs;eem to have
been the fears of my invi&longs;ible protector. El&longs;e why
that &longs;tartling intreaty to refrain from opening the
clo&longs;et? By what inexplicable
in&longs;atuation was I
compelled to proceed?






Yet my conduct was wi&longs;e. Carwin, unable to
comprehend my folly, a&longs;cribed my behaviour to my
knowledge. He conceived him&longs;elf previou&longs;ly detected,
and &longs;uch detection being po&longs;&longs;ible to flow
only from my heavenly friend, and his enemy, his
fears acquired additional &longs;trength.
He is apprized of the nature and intentions of this
being. Perhaps he is a human agent. Yet, on
that &longs;uppo&longs;ition his atchievements are incredible.
Why &longs;hould I be &longs;elected as the object of his care;
or, if a mere mortal, &longs;hould I not recognize &longs;ome one,
whom, benefits imparted and received had prompted
to love me? What were the limits and duration
of his guardian&longs;hip? Was the genius of my birth
entru&longs;ted by divine benignity with this province?
Are human faculties adequate to receive &longs;tronger
proofs of the exi&longs;tence of un&longs;ettered and beneficent
intelligences than I have received?
But who was this man's coadjutor? The voice
that acknowledged an alliance in treachery with
Carwin warned me to avoid the &longs;ummer-hou&longs;e.
He a&longs;&longs;ured me that there only my &longs;afety was endangered.
His a&longs;&longs;urance, as it now appears, was sallacious.
Was there not deceit in his admonition?
Was his compact really annulled? Some purpo&longs;e
was, perhaps, to be accompli&longs;hed by preventing my
future vi&longs;its to that &longs;pot. Why was I enjoined
&longs;ilence to others, on the &longs;ubject of this admonition,
unle&longs;s it were for &longs;ome unauthorized and guilty
purpo&longs;e?
No one but my&longs;elf was accu&longs;tomed to vi&longs;it it.
Backward, it was hidden from di&longs;tant view by the
rock, and in front, it was &longs;creened from all examination,
by creeping plants, and the branches of cedars.
What rece&longs;s could be more propitious to &longs;ecrecy?




The &longs;pirit which haunted it formerly was pure and
rapturous. It was a &longs;ane &longs;acred to the memory of
infantile days, and to bli&longs;sful imaginations of the
future! What a gloomy rever&longs;e had &longs;ucceeded
&longs;ince the ominous arrival of this &longs;tranger! Now,
perhaps, it is the &longs;cene of his meditations. Purposes
fraught with horror, that &longs;hun the light, and
contemplate the pollution of innocence, are here
engendered, and fo&longs;tered, and reared to maturity.
Such were the ideas that, during the night, were
tumultuou&longs;ly revolved by me. I reviewed every
conver&longs;ation in which Carwin had borne a part.
I &longs;tudied to di&longs;cover the true inferences deducible
from his deportment and words with regard to his
former adventures and actual views. I pondered
on the comments which he made on the relation
which I had given of the clo&longs;et dialogue. No new
ideas &longs;ugge&longs;ted them&longs;elves in the cour&longs;e of this review.
My expectation had, from the fir&longs;t, been
di&longs;appointed on the &longs;mall degree of &longs;urprize which
this narrative excited in him. He never explicitly
declared his opinion as to the nature of tho&longs;e voices,
or decided whether they were real or vi&longs;ionary.
He recommended no mea&longs;ures of caution or prevention.

But what mea&longs;ures were now to be taken? Was
the danger which threatened me at an end? Had
I nothing more to fear? I was lonely, and without
means of defence. I could not calculate the motives
and regulate the foot&longs;teps of this per&longs;on. What
certainty was there, that he would not re-a&longs;&longs;ume
his purpo&longs;es, and &longs;wiftly return to the execution of
them?
This idea covered me once more with di&longs;may.
How deeply did I regret the &longs;olitude in which I was
placed, and how ardently did I de&longs;ire the return of




day! But neither of the&longs;e inconveniencies were
&longs;u&longs;ceptible of remedy. At fir&longs;t, it occurred to me
to &longs;ummon my &longs;ervant, and make her &longs;pend the
night in my chamber; but the inefficacy of this expedient
to enhance my &longs;afety was ea&longs;ily &longs;een. Once
I re&longs;olved to leave the hou&longs;e, and retire to my brother's,
but was deterred by reflecting on the unseasonableness
of the hour, on the alarm which my
arrival, and the account which I &longs;hould be obliged
to give, might occa&longs;ion, and on the danger to which
I might expo&longs;e my&longs;elf in the way thither. I began,
likewi&longs;e, to con&longs;ider Carwin's return to mole&longs;t me
as exceedingly improbable. He had relinqui&longs;hed,
of his own accord, his de&longs;ign, and departed without
compul&longs;ion.
“Surely,” &longs;aid I, “there is omnipotence in the
cau&longs;e that changed the views of a man like Carwin.
The divinity that &longs;hielded me from his attempts will
take &longs;uitable care of my future &longs;afety. Thus to yield
to my fears is to de&longs;erve that they &longs;hould be real.”
Scarcely had I uttered the&longs;e words, when my
attention was &longs;tartled by the &longs;ound of foot&longs;teps.
They denoted &longs;ome one &longs;tepping into the piazza in
front of my hou&longs;e. My new-born confidence was
extingui&longs;hed in a moment. Carwin, I thought,
had repented his departure, and was ha&longs;tily returning.
The po&longs;&longs;ibility that his return was prompted
by intentions con&longs;i&longs;tent with my &longs;afety, found no
place in my mind. Images of violation and murder
a&longs;&longs;ailed me anew, and the terrors which succeeded
almo&longs;t incapacitated me from taking any
mea&longs;ures for my defence. It was an impul&longs;e of
which I was &longs;carcely con&longs;cious, that made me fa&longs;ten
the lock and draw the bolts of my chamber door.
Having done this, I threw my&longs;elf on a &longs;eat; for I
trembled to a degree which di&longs;abled me from




standing, and my &longs;oul was &longs;o perfectly ab&longs;orbed in the
act of li&longs;tening, that almo&longs;t the vital motions were
&longs;topped.
The door below creaked on its hinges. It was
not again thru&longs;t to, but appeared to remain open.
Foot&longs;teps entered, traver&longs;ed the entry, and began
to mount the &longs;tairs. How I dete&longs;ted the folly of
not pur&longs;uing the man when he withdrew, and bolting
after him the outer door! Might he not conceive
this omi&longs;&longs;ion to be a proof that my angel had
de&longs;erted me, and be thereby fortified in guilt?
Every &longs;tep on the &longs;tairs, which brought him
nearer to my chamber, added vigor to my desperation.
The evil with which I was menaced was to
be at any rate eluded. How little did I preconceive
the conduct which, in an exigence like this, I
&longs;hould be prone to adopt. You will &longs;uppo&longs;e that
deliberation and de&longs;pair would have &longs;ugge&longs;ted the
&longs;ame cour&longs;e of action, and that I &longs;hould have, unhesitatingly,
re&longs;orted to the be&longs;t means of per&longs;onal
defence within my power. A penknife lay open
upon my table. I remembered that it was there,
and &longs;eized it. For what purpo&longs;e you will &longs;carcely
inquire. It will be immediately &longs;uppo&longs;ed that I
meant it for my la&longs;t refuge, and that if all other
means &longs;hould fail, I &longs;hould plunge it into the heart
of my ravi&longs;her.
I have lo&longs;t all faith in the &longs;tedfa&longs;tne&longs;s of human
re&longs;olves. It was thus that in periods of calm I had
determined to act. No cowardice had been held by
me in greater abhorrence than that which prompted
an injured female to de&longs;troy, not her injurer ere
the injury was perpetrated, but her&longs;elf when it was
without remedy. Yet now this penknife appeared
to me of no other u&longs;e than to baffle my a&longs;&longs;ailant,
and prevent the crime by de&longs;troying my&longs;elf. To




deliberate at &longs;uch a time was impo&longs;&longs;ible; but among
the tumultuous &longs;ugge&longs;tions of the moment, I do
not recollect that it once occurred to me to u&longs;e it
as an in&longs;trument of direct defence.
The &longs;teps had now reached the &longs;econd floor.
Every footfall accelerated the completion, without
augmenting, the certainty of evil. The consciousness
that the door was fa&longs;t, now that nothing but
that was interpo&longs;ed between me and danger, was a
&longs;ource of &longs;ome con&longs;olation. I ca&longs;t my eye towards
the window. This, likewi&longs;e, was a new suggestion.
If the door &longs;hould give way, it was my
&longs;udden re&longs;olution to throw my&longs;elf from the window.
Its height from the ground, which was covered
beneath by a brick pavement, would in&longs;ure
my de&longs;truction; but I thought not of that.
When oppo&longs;ite to my door the foot&longs;teps cea&longs;ed.
Was he li&longs;tening whether my fears were allayed,
and my caution were a&longs;leep? Did he hope to take
me by &longs;urprize? Yet, if &longs;o, why did he allow &longs;o
many noi&longs;y &longs;ignals to betray his approach? Presently
the &longs;teps were again heard to approach the
door. An hand was laid upon the lock, and the
latch pulled back. Did he imagine it po&longs;&longs;ible that
I &longs;hould fail to &longs;ecure the door? A &longs;light effort
was made to pu&longs;h it open, as if all bolts being withdrawn,
a &longs;light effort only was required.
I no &longs;ooner perceived this, than I moved &longs;wiftly
towards the window. Carwin's frame might be
&longs;aid to be all mu&longs;cle. His &longs;trength and activity
had appeared, in various in&longs;tances, to be prodigious.
A &longs;light exertion of his force would demoli&longs;h the
door. Would not that exertion be made? Too
&longs;urely it would; but, at the &longs;ame moment that this
ob&longs;tacle &longs;hould yield, and he &longs;hould enter the apartment,
my determination was formed to leap from




the window. My &longs;en&longs;es were &longs;till bound to this
object. I gazed at the door in momentary expectation
that the a&longs;&longs;ault would be made. The pau&longs;e
continued. The per&longs;on without was irre&longs;olute and
motionle&longs;s.
Suddenly, it occurred to me that Carwin might
conceive me to have fled. That I had not betaken
my&longs;elf to flight was, indeed, the lea&longs;t probable of all
conclu&longs;ions. In this per&longs;ua&longs;ion he mu&longs;t have been
confirmed on finding the lower door unfa&longs;tened,
and the chamber door locked. Was it not wi&longs;e
to fo&longs;ter this per&longs;ua&longs;ion? Should I maintain deep
&longs;ilence, this, in addition to other circum&longs;tances,
might encourage the belief, and he would once
more depart. Every new reflection added plausibility
to this rea&longs;oning. It was pre&longs;ently more
&longs;trongly enforced, when I noticed foot&longs;teps withdrawing
from the door. The blood once more
flowed back to my heart, and a dawn of exultation
began to ri&longs;e: but my joy was &longs;hort lived. Instead
of de&longs;cending the &longs;tairs, he pa&longs;&longs;ed to the door
of the oppo&longs;ite chamber, opened it, and having entered,
&longs;hut it after him with a violence that &longs;hook
the hou&longs;e.
How was I to interpret this circum&longs;tance? For
what end could he have entered this chamber? Did
the violence with which he clo&longs;ed the door te&longs;tify
the depth of his vexation? This room was u&longs;ually
occupied by Pleyel. Was Carwin aware of his
ab&longs;ence on this night? Could he be &longs;u&longs;pected of
a de&longs;ign &longs;o &longs;ordid as pillage? If this were his view
there were no means in my power to fru&longs;trate it. It
behoved me to &longs;eize the fir&longs;t opportunity to e&longs;cape;
but if my e&longs;cape were &longs;uppo&longs;ed by my enemy to
have been already effected, no a&longs;ylum was more
&longs;ecure than the pre&longs;ent. How could my pa&longs;&longs;age




from the hou&longs;e be accompli&longs;hed without noi&longs;es that
might incite him to pur&longs;ue me?
Utterly at a lo&longs;s to account for his going into
Pleyel's chamber, I waited in in&longs;tant expectation
of hearing him come forth. All, however, was profoundly
&longs;till. I li&longs;tened in vain for a con&longs;iderable
period, to catch the &longs;ound of the door when it
&longs;hould again be opened. There was no other
avenue by which he could e&longs;cape, but a door which
led into the girl's chamber. Would any evil from
this quarter befall the girl?
Hence aro&longs;e a new train of apprehen&longs;ions. They
merely added to the turbulence and agony of
my reflections. Whatever evil impended over her,
I had no power to avert it. Seclu&longs;ion and &longs;ilence
were the only means of &longs;aving my&longs;elf from the
perils of this fatal night. What &longs;olemn vows did
I put up, that if I &longs;hould once more behold the
light of day, I would never tru&longs;t my&longs;elf again
within the thre&longs;hold of this dwelling!
Minute lingered after minute, but no token was
given that Carwin had returned to the pa&longs;&longs;age.
What, I again a&longs;ked, could detain him in this
room? Was it po&longs;&longs;ible that he had returned, and
glided, unperceived, away? I was &longs;peedily aware
of the difficulty that attended an enterprize like
this; and yet, as if by that means I were capable
of gaining any information on that head, I ca&longs;t
anxious looks from the window.
The object that fir&longs;t attracted my attention was
an human figure &longs;tanding on the edge of the bank.
Perhaps my penetration was a&longs;&longs;i&longs;ted by my hopes.
Be that as it will, the figure of Carwin was clearly
di&longs;tingui&longs;hable. From the ob&longs;curity of my &longs;tation,
it was impo&longs;&longs;ible that I &longs;hould be di&longs;cerned by him,
and yet he &longs;carcely
&longs;uffered me to catch a glimp&longs;e





of him. He turned and went down the &longs;teep,
which, in this part, was not difficult to be &longs;caled.
My conjecture then had been right. Carwin
has &longs;oftly opened the door, de&longs;cended the &longs;tairs, and
i&longs;&longs;ued forth. That I &longs;hould not have overheard
his &longs;teps, was only le&longs;s incredible than that my eyes
had deceived me. But what was now to be done?
The hou&longs;e was at length delivered from this dete&longs;ted
inmate. By one avenue might he again re-enter.
Was it not wife to bar the lower door? Perhaps
he had gone out by the kitchen door. For this
end, he mu&longs;t have pa&longs;&longs;ed through Judith's chamber.
The&longs;e entrances being clo&longs;ed and bolted, as
great &longs;ecurity was gained as was compatible with my
lonely condition.
The propriety of the&longs;e mea&longs;ures was too manifest
not to make me &longs;truggle &longs;ucce&longs;sfully with my
fears. Yet I opened my own door with the utmo&longs;t
caution, and de&longs;cended as if I were affraid that
Carwin had been &longs;till immured in Pleyel's chamber.
The outer door was a-jar. I &longs;hut, with
trembling eagerne&longs;s, and drew every bolt that appended
to it. I then pa&longs;&longs;ed with light and le&longs;s cautious
&longs;teps through the parlour, but was &longs;urprized
to di&longs;cover that the kitchen door was &longs;ecure. I
was compelled to acquie&longs;ce in the fir&longs;t conjecture
that Carwin had e&longs;caped through the entry.
My heart was now &longs;omewhat ea&longs;ed of the load
of apprehen&longs;ion. I returned once more to my
chamber, the door of which I was careful to lock.
It was no time to think of repo&longs;e. The moon-light
began already to fade before the light of the
day. The approach of morning was betokened
by the u&longs;ual &longs;ignals. I mu&longs;ed upon the events of
this night, and determined to take up my abode
henceforth at my brother's. Whether I &longs;hould




inform him of what had happened was a que&longs;tion
which &longs;eemed to demand &longs;ome con&longs;ideration. My
&longs;afety unque&longs;tionably required that I &longs;hould abandon
my pre&longs;ent habitation.
As my thoughts began to flow with fewer impediments,
the image of Pleyel, and the dubiousness
of his condition, again recurred to me. I
again ran over the po&longs;&longs;ible cau&longs;es of his ab&longs;ence
on the preceding day. My mind was attuned to
melancholy. I dwelt, with an ob&longs;tinacy for which
I could not account, on the idea of his death. I
painted to my&longs;elf his &longs;truggles with the billows,
and his la&longs;t appearance. I imagined my&longs;elf a midnight
wanderer on the &longs;hore, and to have &longs;tumbled
on his corp&longs;e, which the tide had ca&longs;t up. The&longs;e
dreary images affected me even to tears. I endeavoured
not to re&longs;train them. They imparted a relief
which I had not anticipated. The more copiously
they flowed, the more did my general sensations
appear to &longs;ub&longs;ide into calm, and a certain
re&longs;tle&longs;&longs;ne&longs;s give way to repo&longs;e.
Perhaps, relieved by this effu&longs;ion, the &longs;lumber
&longs;o much wanted might have &longs;tolen on my &longs;en&longs;es,
had there been no new cau&longs;e of alarm.
