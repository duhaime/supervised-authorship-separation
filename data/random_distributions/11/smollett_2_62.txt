MY DEAREST LETTY,
NEVER did poor prisoner long for deliverance,
more than I have longed for an opportunity
to disburden my cares into your friendly bosom; 
and the occasion which now presents itself, is little
less than miraculous —Honest Saunders Macawly,
the travelling Scotchman, who goes every year to
Wales, is now at Glasgow, buying goods, and
coming to pay his respects to our family; has undertaken
to deliver this letter into your own hand — 

We have been six weeks in Scotland, and seen
the principal towns of the kingdom, where we
have been treated with great civility —The people
are very courteous; and the country being exceedingly
romantic, suits my turn and inclinations —I
contracted some friendships at Edinburgh, which
is a large and lofty city, full of gay company; 
and, in particular, commenced an intimate correspondence
with one miss R&wblank;t&wblank;n, an amiable
young lady of my own age, whose charms seemed
to soften, and even to subdue the stubborn
heart of my brother Jery; but he no sooner left
the place than he relapsed into his former insensibility 
—I feel, however, that this indifference is
not the family-constitution —I never admitted but
one idea of love, and that has taken such root in
my heart, as to be equally proof against all the
pulls of discretion, and the frests of neglect. 
Dear Letty! I had an alarming adventure at
the hunters ball in Edinburgh —While I sat discoursing
with a friend in a corner, all at once the
very image of Wilson stood before me, dressed exactly
as he was in the character of Aimwell! It
was one Mr. Gordon, whom I had not seen before 
—Shocked at the sudden apparition, I fainted
away, and threw the whole assembly in confusion — 
However, the cause of my disorder remained a secret
to every body but my brother, who was likewise
struck with the resemblance, and scolded after
we came home —I am very sensible of Jery's
affection, and know he spoke as well with a
view to my own interest and happiness, as in regard
to the honour of the family; but I cannot
bear to have my wounds probed severely —I was
not so much affected by the censure he passed upon
my own indiscretion, as with the reflection he
made on the conduct of Wilson —He observed, 

that if he was really the gentleman he pretended
to be, and harboured nothing but honourable designs,
he would have vindicated his pretensions
in the face of day —This remark made a deep
impression upon my mind —I endeavoured to conceal
my thoughts; and this endeavour had a bad
effect upon my health and spirits; so it was
thought necessary that I should go to the Highlands,
and drink the goat-milk-whey. 
We went accordingly to Lough-Lomond, one
of the most enchanting spots in the whole world; 
and what with this remedy, which I had every
morning fresh from the mountains, and the pure
air, and chearful company, I have recovered my
flesh and appetite; though there is something still
at bottom, which it is not in the power of air,
exercise, company, or medicine to remove — 
These incidents would not touch me so nearly,
if I had a sensible confidant to sympathize with
my affliction, and comfort me with wholesome
advice —I have nothing of this kind, except Win.
Jenkins, who is really a good body in the main,
but very ill qualified for such an office —The
poor creature is weak in her nerves, as well as in
her understanding; otherwise I might have known
the true name and character of that unfortunate
youth —But why do I call him unfortunate? perhaps
the epithet is more applicable to me for having
listened to the false professions of —But,
hold! I have as yet no right, and sure I have no
inclination to believe any thing to the prejudice of
his honour —In that reflection I shall still exert my
patience —As for Mrs. Jenkins, she herself is really
an object of compassion —Between vanity, methodism,
and love, her head, is almost turned. I
should have more regard for her however, if she
had been more constant in the object of her affection; 

but, truly, she aimed at conquest, and flirted
at the same time with my uncle's footman,
Humphry Clinker, who is really a deserving young
man, and one Dutton, my brother's valet de
chambre, a debauched fellow; who, leaving Win.
in the lurch, ran away with another man's bride
at Berwick. 
My dear Willis, I am am truly ashamed of my
own sex —We complain of advantages which
the men take of our youth, inexperience, sensibility,
and all that; but I have seen enough to believe,
that our sex in general make it their business
to ensnare the other; and for this purpose,
employ arts which are by no means to be justified 
—In point of constancy, they certainly have
nothing to reproach the male part of the creation 
—My poor aunt, without any regard to her years
and imperfections, has gone to market with her
charms in every place where she thought she
had the least chance to dispose of her person,
which, however, hangs still heavy on her hands 
—I am afraid she has used even religion as a decoy,
though it has not answered her expectation 
—She has been praying, preaching, and catechising
among the methodists, with whom this
country abounds; and pretends to have such manifestations
and revelations, as even Clinker himself
can hardly believe, though the poor fellow is
half crazy with enthusiasm. As for Jenkins, she
affects to take all her mistress's reveries for gospel 
—She has also her heart-heavings and motions
of the spirit; and God forgive me if I think
uncharitably, but all this seems to me to be down-right
hypocrisy and deceit —Perhaps, indeed, the
poor girl imposes on herself —She is generally in
a flutter, and is much subject to vapours —Since
we came to Scotland, she has seen apparitions, 

and pretends to prophesy —If I could put faith
in all these supernatural visitations, I should think
myself abandoned of grace; for I have neither
seen, heard, nor felt any thing of this nature, although
I endeavour to discharge the duties of religion
with all the sincerity, zeal, and devotion,
that is in the power of, 
Dear Letty,
your ever affectionate,
Lydia Melford. 
Glasgow, Sept. 7. 
We are so far on our return to Brambelton hall; 
and I would fain hope we shall take Gloucester
in our way, in which case I shall have the in
expressible pleasure of embracing my dear Willis 
—Pray remember me to my worthy governess.
