A shoe coming loose from the
fore-foot of the thill-horse, at
the beginning of the ascent of mount
Taurira, the postilion dismounted,
twisted the shoe off, and put it in
his pocket; as the ascent was of five
or six miles, and that horse our main
dependence, I made a point of having
the shoe fasten'd on again, as well as
we could; but the postilion had
thrown away the nails, and the hammer
in the chaise-box, being of no
great use without them, I submitted
to go on. 

He had not mounted half a mile
higher, when coming to a flinty
piece of road, the poor devil lost a
second shoe, and from off his other
fore-foot; I then got out of the
chaise in good earnest; and seeing
a house about a quarter of a mile to
the left-hand, with a great deal to do
I prevailed upon the postilion to
turn up to it. The look of the house,
and of every thing about it, as we
drew nearer, soon reconciled me
to the disaster. —It was a little
farm-house surrounded with about
twenty acres of vineyard, about as
much corn—and close to the house,
on one side, was a potagerie of an
acre and a half, full of every thing 

which could make plenty in a French
peasant's house—and on the other
side was a little wood which furnished
wherewithal to dress it. It was about
eight in the evening when I got to the
house—so I left the postilion to manage
his point as he could—and for
mine, I walk'd directly into the
house. 
The family consisted of an old
grey-headed man and his wife, with
five or six sons and sons-in-law and
their several wives, and a joyous genealogy
out of 'em. 
They were all sitting down together
to their lentil-soup; a large
wheaten loaf was in the middle of the 

table; and a flaggon of wine at each
end of it promised joy thro' the
stages of the repast—'twas a feast of
love. 
The old man rose up to meet me,
and with a respectful cordiality would
have me sit down at the table; my
heart was sat down the moment I enter'd
the room; so I sat down at once
like a son of the family; and to invest
myself in the character as speedily as I
could, I instantly borrowed the old
man's knife, and taking up the loaf
cut myself a hearty luncheon; and as I
did it I saw a testimony in every eye,
not only of an honest welcome,
but of a welcome mix'd with thanks
that I had not seem'd to doubt it. 

Was it this; or tell me, Nature,
what else it was which made this morsel
so sweet—and to what magick I
owe it, that the draught I took of
their flaggon was so delicious with
it, that they remain upon my palate
to this hour? 
If the supper was to my taste— 
the grace which follow'd it was much
more so.
