Miss Howe, To Miss Clarissa Harlowe. 

Sunday, May 14. 
How it is now, my dear, between you and Mr.
Lovelace, I cannot tell. But wicked as the man
is, I am afraid he must be your Lord and Master. 
I called him by several very hard names in my last. 
I had but just heard of some of his vilenesses, when I
sat down to write; so my indignation was raised. But
on enquiry, and recollection, I find that the facts laid
to his charge were all of them committed some time 

ago—not since he has had strong hopes of your favour. 
This is saying something for him. His generous
behaviour to the Innkeeper's Daughter, is a more recent
instance to his credit; to say nothing of the universal
good character he has as a kind Landlord. And
then I approve much of the motion he made to put
you in possession of Mrs. Fretchville's house, while
he continues at the other widow's, till you agree that
one house shall hold you. I wish this were done. Besure
you embrace this offer (if you do not soon meet
at the Altar) and get one of his Cousins with you. 
Were you once married, I should think you cannot
be very unhappy, tho' you may not be so happy
with him as you deserve to be. The stake he has in
his country, and his reversions; the care he takes of
his affairs; his freedom from obligation; nay, his
pride, with your merit, must be a tolerable security
for you, I should think. Tho' particulars of his
wickedness, as they come to my knowlege, hurt and
incense me; yet, after all, when I give myself time
to reflect, all that I have heard of him to his disadvantage
was comprehended in the general character
given of him long ago, by Lord M's and his own
dismissed bailiff (a) , and which was confirmed to me
by Mrs. Fortescue, as I heretofore told you (b) , and
to you by Mrs. Greme (c) . 
You can have nothing therefore, I think, to be
deeply concerned about, but his future good, and the
bad example he may hereafter set to his own family. 
These indeed are very just concerns: But were you
to leave him now, either with or without his consent,
his fortune and alliances so considerable, his person
and address so engaging (every one excusing you
now on those accounts, and because of your Relations
follies) it would have a very ill appearance for 

your reputation. I cannot therefore, on the most
deliberate consideration, advise you to think of that,
while you have no reason to doubt his honour. May
eternal vengeance pursue the villain if he give room
for an apprehension of this nature! 
Yet his teazing ways are intolerable: His acquiescence
with your slight delays, and his resignedness
to the distance you now keep him at (for a fault
so much slighter as he must think, than the punishment)
are unaccountable: He doubts your Love of
him, that is very probable; but you have reason to
be surprised at his want of ardor; a Blessing so great
within his reach, as I may say. 
By the time you have read to this place, you will
have no doubt of what has been the issue of the conference
between the Two Gentlemen. I am equally
shocked, and enraged against them All. Against them
All, I say; for I have tried your good Norton's
weight with your Mother (though at first I did not
intend to tell you so) to the same purpose as the gentleman
sounded your Uncle. Never were there such
determined brutes in the world! Why should I mince
the matter? Yet would I fain methinks make an exception
for your Mother. 
Your Uncle will have it, that you are ruined. ‘He
can believe every-thing bad of a creature, he says,
who could run away with a man; with such a one
especially as Lovelace. They expected applications
from you, when some heavy distress had fallen upon
you. But they are all resolved not to stir an inch in
your favour; no, not to save your life!’ 
My dearest soul, resolve to assert your right. Claim
your own, and go and live upon it, as you ought. 
Then, if you marry not, how will the wretches creep
to you, for your reversionary dispositions! 
You were accused (as in your Aunt's Letter) ‘of
premeditation and contrivance in your escape.’ Instead
of pitying you, the mediating person was called 

upon ‘to pity them; who once, your Uncle said,
doted upon you: Who took no joy but in your
presence: Who devoured your words as you spoke
them: Who trod over again your footsteps, as
you walked before them.’ —And I know not what
of this sort. 
Upon the whole, it is now evident to me, and so
it must be to you, when you read this Letter, that
you must be his. And the sooner you are so, the
better. Shall we suppose that marriage is not in your
power? —I cannot have patience to suppose that. 
I am concerned, methinks, to know how you will
do to condescend (now you see you must be his)
after you have kept him at such distance; and for
the revenge his pride may put him upon taking for it. 
But let me tell you, that if my going up, and sharing
fortunes with you, will prevent such a noble creature
from stooping too low; much more, were it likely
to prevent your ruin; I would not hesitate a moment
about it. What is the whole world to me, weighed
against such a friend as you are? Think you, that
any of the enjoyments of this life could be enjoyments
to me, were you involved in calamities, from
which I could either alleviate or relieve you, by giving
up those enjoyments? And what in saying this,
and acting up to it, do I offer you, but the fruits of a
friendship your worth has created? 
Excuse my warmth of expression. The warmth of
my heart wants none. I am enraged at your Relations; 
for, bad as what I have mentioned is, I have
not told you all; nor now, perhaps, ever will. I am
angry at my own Mother's narrowness of mind, and
at her indiscriminate adherence to old notions. And
I am exasperated against your foolish, your low-vanity'd
Lovelace. But let us stoop to take the
wretch as he is, and make the best of him, since you
are destined to stoop, to keep grovelers and worldlings
in countenance. He has not been guilty of 

direct indecency to you. Nor dare he. —Not so much
of a devil as that comes to neither. Had he such villainous
intentions, so much in his power as you are,
they would have shewn themselves before now to
such a penetrating and vigilant eye, and to such a pure
heart as yours. Let us save the wretch then, if we
can, tho' we soil our fingers in lifting him up from
his dirt. 
There is yet, to a person of your fortune and independence,
a good deal to do, if you enter upon those
terms which ought to be entered upon. I don't find,
that he has once talked of Settlements; nor yet of
the Licence. A foolish wretch! —But as your evil
destiny has thrown you out of all other protection
and mediation, you must be Father, Mother, Uncle
to yourself; and enter upon the requisite points for
yourself. It is hard upon you; but indeed you must. 
Your situation requires it. What room for delicacy
now? —Or would you have me write to him? Yet
that would be the same thing, as if you were to write
yourself. Yet write you should, I think, if you cannot
speak. But speaking is certainly best: For words
leave no traces; they pass as breath; and mingle with
air; and may be explained with latitude. But the
pen is a witness on record. 
I know the gentleness of your spirit; I know the
laudable pride of your heart; and the just notion you
have of the dignity of our Sex, in these delicate points. 
But once more, all this is nothing now: Your honour
is concerned that the dignity I speak of, should
not be stood upon. 
‘Mr. Lovelace,’ would I say; yet hate the foolish
fellow, for his low, his stupid pride, in wishing to
triumph over the dignity of his own Wife;—‘I am
by your means deprived of every friend I have in
the world. In what light am I to look upon you? 
I have well considered of every-thing. You have
made some people, much against my liking, think 

me a Wife: Others know I am not married; nor
do I desire any-body should believe I am. Do you
think your being here in the same house with me
can be to my reputation? You talked to me of Mrs.
Fretchville's house.’ This will bring him to renew
his last discourse on that subject, if he does not revive
it of himself. ‘If Mrs. Fretchville knows not her
own mind, what is her house to me? You talked
of bringing up your Cousin Montague to bear me
company: If my Brother's schemes be your pretence
for not going yourself to fetch her, you can
write to her. I insist upon bringing these two points
to an issue: Off or on, ought to be indifferent to
me, if so to them.’ 
Such a declaration must bring all forward. There
are twenty ways, my dear, that you would find out
for another in your circumstances. He will disdain,
from his native insolence, to have it thought he has
any-body to consult. Well then, will he not be obliged
to declare himself? And if he does, no delays on your
side, I beseech you. Give him the day. Let it be a
short one. It would be derogating from your own
merit, and honour too, let me tell you, even altho' he
should not be so explicit as he ought to be, to seem but
to doubt his meaning; and to wait for that explanation
for which I should for ever despise him, if he
makes it necessary. Twice already have you, my
dear, if not oftener, modesty'd away such opportunities
as you ought not to have slipt. As to settlements, if
they come not in naturally, e'en leave them to his
own justice, and to the justice of his family. And
there's an end of the matter. 
This is my advice: Mend it as circumstances offer,
and follow your own. But indeed, my dear, this, or
something like it, would I do. &dotup;And let him tell
me afterwards, if he dared or would, that he humbled
down to his shoe-buckles the person it would
have been his glory to exalt. 

&dotup;Support yourself mean time with reflections
worthy of yourself. Tho' tricked into this man's
power, you are not meanly subjugated to it. All his
reverence you command, or rather, as I may say,
inspire; since it was never known, that he had any
reverence for aught that was good, till you was
with him: And he professes now-and-then to be
so awed and charmed by your example, as that the
force of it shall reclaim him. 
&dotup;I believe you will have a difficult task to keep
him to it: But the more will be your honour, if
you effect his Reformation: And it is my belief,
that if you can reclaim this great, this specious deceiver,
who has, morally speaking, such a number
of years before him, you will save from ruin a
multitude of innocents; for those seem to me to
have been the prey for which he has spread his
wicked snares. And who knows but, for this very
purpose principally, a person may have been permitted
to swerve, whose heart or will never was in
her error, and who has so much remorse upon her
for having, as she thinks, erred at all? Adieu, my
dearest friend.&dotup; 
Anna Howe. 
Inclosed in the above. 
I must trouble you with my concerns, tho' your
own are so heavy upon you. A piece of news I
have to tell you. Your Uncle Antony is disposed to
marry. With whom, think you? With my Mother. 
True indeed. Your family know it. All is laid with
redoubled malice at your door. And there the old
Soul himself lays it. 
Take no notice of this intelligence, not so much
as in your Letters to me, for fear of accidents. 
I think it can't do. But were I to provoke my
Mother, that might afford a pretence. Else, I should
have been with you before now, I fansy. 
The first likelihood that appears to me of encouragement, 

I dismiss Hickman, that's certain. If
my Mother disoblige me in so important an article, I
shan't think of obliging her in such another. It is
impossible, surely, that the desire of popping me off to
that honest man can be with such a view. 
I repeat, that it cannot come to any-thing. But
these widows—Then such a love in us all, both old
and young, of being courted and admired! —And
so irresistible to their Elderships to be flattered that
all power is not over with them; but that they may
still class and prank it with their daughters. —It
vexed me heartily to have her tell me of this proposal
with self-complaisant simperings; and yet she
affected to speak of it, as if she had no intention to
encourage it. 
These antiquated bachelors (old before they believe
themselves to be so) imagine, that when they have
once persuaded themselves to think of the State, they
have nothing more to do than to make their minds
known to the woman. 
Your Uncle's overgrown fortune is indeed a bait; 
a tempting one. A saucy Daughter to be got rid of! 
The memory of the Father of that Daughter not
precious enough to weigh much! —But let him advance
if he dare—Let her encourage—But I hope she
won't. 
Excuse me, my dear. I am nettled. They have
fearfully rumpled my gorget. You'll think me faulty. 
So I won't put my name to this separate paper. Other
hands may resemble mine. You did not see me write
it.
