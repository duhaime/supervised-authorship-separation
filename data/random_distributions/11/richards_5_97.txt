Miss Byron, To Miss Selby. 


Monday, Mar. 20. 
The active, the restless goodness, of this Sir
Charles Grandison, absolutely dazles me, Lucy! 
The good Dr. Bartlett has obliged us all with the
sight of two letters, which give an account of what
he has done for Lord W. his uncle. He has been
more than a father to his uncle: Does not that sound
strange? But he is to be the obliger of every-body. 
The Doctor said, that since Miss Grandison had
claimed the benefit of her brother's permission for
him to use his own discretion in communicating to us 

such of the letters as he was favoured with by Sir
Charles, he believed he could not more unexceptionably
oblige Lord L. and the sisters, than by reading to
them those two letters, as they were a kind of family
subject. 
After the Doctor had done reading, he withdrew
to his closet. I stole up after him, and obtained his
leave to transmit them to you. 
Lucy, be chary of them, and return them when
perused. 
There is no such thing as pointing out particular
passages of generosity, justice, prudence, disinterestedness,
beneficence, that strike one in those letters,
without transcribing every paragraph in them. And,
ah Lucy! there are other observations to be made; 
mortifying ones, I fear. 
Only let me say, That I think, if Sir Charles
Grandison could and would tender himself to my acceptance,
I ought to decline his hand. Do you think,
if I were his, I should not live in continual dread of
a separation from him, even by that inevitable stroke
which, alone, could be the means of completing his
existence? 
This is the man, ye modest, ye tender-hearted fair
ones, whom ye should seek to intitle to your vows:
Not the lewd, the obscene libertine, foul Harpy, son
of Riot, and of Erebus; glorying in his wickedness,
triumphing in your weakness, and seeking by storm to
win an heart that ought to shink at his approach. 
Shall not Like cleave to Like? â€”Henceforth may it be
so, wishes 
Your Harriet Byron.
