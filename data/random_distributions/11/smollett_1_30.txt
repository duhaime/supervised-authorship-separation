Another providential deliverance, from the effects
of the smuggler's ingenious conjecture. 
During these deliberations, the wine-merchant,
with a view to make a parade of
his superior parts and breeding, as well as to
pave the way for a match at backgammon, made
a tender of his snuff box to our adventurer,
and asked in bad French, how he travelled
from Paris. This question produced a series
of interrogations, concerning the place of Ferdinand's
abode in that city, and his business in
England; so that he was was fain to practise
the science of defence, and answered with such
ambiguity, as arroused the suspicion of the
smuggler, who began to believe our hero had
some very cogent reason, for evading his curiosity. 
He immediately set his reflection at work,
and after various conjectures, fixed upon Fathom's
being the young pretender. Big with
this supposition, he eyed him with the most
earnest attention, comparing his features with
those of the chevalier's portrait, which he had
seen in France, and though the faces were as
unlike as any two human faces could be, found
the resemblance so striking as to dispel all his
doubts, and persuade him to introduce the
stranger to some Justice on the road: a step
by which he would not only manifest his zeal
for the protestant succession, but also acquire
the splendid reward proposed by parliament, to
any person who should apprehend that famous
adventurer. 

These ideas intoxicated the brain of this man,
to such a pitch of enthusiasm, that he actually
believed himself in possession of the thirty thousand
pounds, and amused his fancy with a variety
of magnificent projects to be executed by
means of that acquisition; until his reverie was
interrupted by the halting of the coach at the
inn: where the passangers used to eat their
breakfasts. Waked as he was from the dream
of happiness, it had made such impression upon
his mind, that seeing Fathom rise up with an
intention to alight, he took it for granted his
design was to escape, and seizing him by the
collar, called aloud for assistance, in the king's
name. 
Our hero, whose sagacity and presence of
mind very often supplied the place of courage,
instead of being terrified at this assault, which
might have disturbed the tranquility of an ordinary
villain, was so perfectly master of every
circumstance of his own situation, as to know
at once, that the agressor could not possibly
have the least cause of complaint against him; 
and therefore, imputing this violence either to
madness or mistake, very deliberately suffered
himself to be made prisoner by the people of
the house, who ran to the coach-door, in obedience
to the summons of the wine merchant. 
The rest of the company were struck dumb
with surprize and consternation at this sudden
adventure, and the quaker dreading some fell
resistance on the side of the outlandish-man,
unpinned the other coach door in the twinkling
of an eye, and trundled himself into the
mud for safety. The others seeing the temper
and resignation of the prisoner, soon recovered 

their recollection, and began to enquire into
the cause of his arrest: Upon which the captor,
whose teeth chattered with terror and impatience,
gave them to understand that he was
a state criminal, and demanded their help in
conveying him to justice. 
Luckily for both parties, there happened to
be at the inn a company of squires just returned
from the death of a leash of hares, which
they had ordered to be dressed for dinner, and
among these gentlemen, was one of the Quorum,
to whom the accuser had immediate recourse,
marching before the captive, who walked
very peaceably between the landlord and
one of his waiters, and followed by a croud of
spectators, some whom had secured the faithful
Maurice, who, in his behaviour, closely imitated
the deliberation of his master. In this
order did the procession advance to the apartment,
in which the magistrate with his fellows
of the chace, sat smoaking his morning pipe
over a tankard of strong ale; and the smuggler
being directed to the right person, “May
it please your worship, said he, I have brought
this foreigner before you, on a violent suspicion
of his being a proclaimed out-law, and I
desire before these witnesses, that my title may
be made good to the reward that shall become
due upon his conviction.” 
“Friend, replied the justice, I know nothing
of you or your titles, but this I know,
if you have any information to give in, you
must come to my house when I am at home,
and proceed in a lawful way, that is, d'ye mind
me, if you swear as how this here person is an
outlaw, then if so be as he has nothing to say 

to the contrary, my clerk shall make out a
mittimus; and so to jail with him till next
size.” “But Sir,” answered the impeacher,
“this is a case that admits of no delay, the person
I have apprehended, is a prisoner of consequence
to the state.” “How! fellor,” cried
the magistrate, interrupting him, “is there
any person of more consequence than one of
his majesty's justices of the peace, who is besides
a considerable member of the landed interest?
d'ye know sirrah, who you are talking
to? if you don't go about your business, I believe
I shall lay you by the heels.” 
The smuggler fearing his prize would escape,
through the ignorance, pride and obstinacy of
this country justice, approached his worship,
and in a whisper, which was overheard by all
the company, assured him, he had indubitable
reason to believe the foreigner was no other
than the pretender's eldest son. At mention
of this formidable name, every individual of
the audience started, with signs of terror and
amazement. The justice dropped his pipe, recoilled
upon his chair, and looking most ridiculously
aghast, exclaimed, “Seize him in the
name of God and his majesty king George!
has he get no secret arms about him?” 
Fathom being thus informed of the suspicion
under which he stood, could not help smiling
at the eagerness with which the spectators
flew upon him; and suffered himself to be
searched with great composure, well knowing
they would find no moveables about his person,
but such as upon examination, would
turn to his account; he, therefore, very calmly
presented to the magistrate his purse, and a 

small box that contained his jewels, and in the
French language, desired they might be preserved
from the hands of the mob. This request
was interpreted by the accuser, who at the
same time laid claim to the booty; the justice
took charge of the deposit, and one of his neighbours
having undertaken the office of clerk,
he proceeded to the examination of the culprit,
whose papers were by this time laid on the table
before him. “Stranger, said he, you stand
charged with being son of the pretender to
these realms: what have you to say in your own
defence?” Our hero assured him in the French
language that he was falsely impeached, and demanded
justice on the accuser, who, without
the least reason, had made such a malicious
attack upon the life and honour of an innocent
gentleman. 
The smuggler, instead of acting the part of
a faithful interpreter, told his Worship that the
prisoner's answer was no more than a simple
denial, which every felon would make, who
had nothing else to plead in his own behalf; 
and that this alone was a strong presumption
of his guilt; because, if he was not really the
person they suspected him to be, the thing
would speak for itself: for, if he was not the
young pretender, who then was he?” This
argument had great weight with the justice,
who assuming a very important aspect, observed,
“Very true, friend, if you are not the
pretender, in the name of God who are you?
one may see with half an eye, that he is no
better than a promiscuous fellow.” 
Ferdinand now began to repent of having
pretended ignorance of the English language, 

as he found himself at the mercy of a rascal,
who put a false gloss upon all his words; and
addressed himself to the audience successively
in French, High Dutch, Italian, and Hungarian
Latin, desiring to know if any person present
understood any of these tongues, that his
answers might be honestly explained to the
bench. But, he might have accosted them in
Chinese with the same success: there was not
one person present tolerably versed in his mother
tongue, much less acquainted with any foreign
language, except the wine-merchant, who
incensed at this appeal, which he considered as
an affront to his integrity, gave the judge to understand,
that the delinquent, instead of speaking
to the purpose, contumaciously insulted
his authority, in sundry foreign lingo's, which
he apprehended, was an additional proof of
his being the chevalier's son, inasmuch, as no
person would take the pains to learn such a
variety of gibberish, except with some sinister
intent. 
This annotation was not lost upon the squire,
who was too jealous of the honour of his office,
to overlook such a flagrant instance of
contempt. His eyes glistened, his cheeks were
inflated with rage: “The case is plain,” said
he, “having nothing of signification to offer
in his own favour, he grows refectory, and abuses
the court in his base Roman catholic jargon:
but I'll let you know, for all you pretend
to be a prince, you are no better than an
outlawed vagrant; and I'll shew you what a
thing are, when you come in composition with
an English justice like me, who have more than
once extinguished myself in the service of my 

country. As nothing else accrues, your purse,
black box and papers shall be sealed up before
witnesses, and sent by express to one of his majesty's
secretaries of state; and as for yourself,
I will apply to the military at Canterbury, for
a guard to conduct you to London.” 
This was a very unwelcome declaration to
our adventurer, who was on the point of harranguing
the justice and spectators in their own
language, when he was relieved from the necessity
of taking that step, by the interposition
of a young nobleman just arrived at the inn,
who being informed of this strange examination,
entered the court, and at first sight of the
prisoner, assured the justice he was imposed
upon: for that he himself had often seen the
young Pretender in Paris, and that there was
no kind of resemblance between that adventurer
and the person now before him. The accuser
was not a little mortified at his lordship's
affirmation, which met with all due regard from
the bench; though the magistrate took notice,
that granting the prisoner was not the young
chevalier himself, it was highly probable, he
was an emissary of that house, as he could give
no satisfactory account of himself, and was
possessed of things of such value as no honest
man would expose to the accidents of the road. 
Fathom having thus found an interpreter,
who signified to him in the French tongue, the
doubts of the justice, told his lordship that he
was a gentleman of a noble house in Germany,
who, for certain reasons, had come abroad
incognito, with a view to see the world; and
that although the letters they had seized, would
prove the truth of that assertion, he should be 

loth to expose his private concerns to the
knowledge of strangers, if he could possibly be
released without that mortification. The young
nobleman explained his desire to the court; 
but his own curiosity being interested, observed
at the same time, that the justice could not
be said to have discharged the duty of his station,
until he should have examined every circumstance
relating to the prisoner: upon which
remonstrance, he was requested by the bench
to peruse the papers, and accordingly communicated
the substance of one letter, to this
effect. 

“My dear son,
Thou I am far from approving the rash
step you have taken in withdrawing yourself
from your father's house, in order to avoid
an engagement, which would have been
equally honourable and advantageous to
your family, I cannot so far suppress my affection,
as to bear the thought of your undergoing
those hardships, which, for your
disobedience, you deserve to suffer. I have
therefore, without the knowledge of your
father, sent the bearer to attend you in your
peregrinations; his fidelity you know hath
been tried in a long course of service, and I
have entrusted to his care for your use, a
purse of two hundred ducats, and a box of
jewels to the value of twice that sum, which,
though not sufficient to support an equipage
suitable to your birth, will, at least for some
time, preserve you from the importunities
of want. When you are dutiful enough to
explain your designs and situation, you may 

expect further indulgence from your too
tender and disconsolate mother, 
“The countess of Fathom.” 
This letter, which, as well as the others, our
hero had forged for the purpose, effectually answered
his intent, in throwing dust in the eyes
and understanding of the spectators, who now
regarded the prisoner with looks of respectful
remorse, as a man of quality who had been falsely
accused: his lordship, to make a parade of
his own politeness and importance, assured the
bench, he was no stranger to the family of the
Fathoms, and with a compliment, gave Ferdinand
to understand he had formerly seen him
at Versailles. There being no longer room
for suspicion, the justice ordered our adventurer
to be set at liberty, and even invited him to
be seated, with an apology for the rude manner
in which he had been treated, owing to the
misinformation of the accuser, who was threatned
with the stocks for his malice and presumption. 
But, this was not the only triumph our hero
obtained over the wine-merchant. Maurice
was no sooner unfettered, than advancing into
the middle of the room; “My lord, (said he,
addressing himself in French, to his master's
deliverer,) since you have been so generous as
to protect a noble stranger from the danger of
such a false accusation, I hope you will still lay
an additional obligation upon the count, by retorting
the vengeance of the law upon his perfidious
accuser, whom I know to be a trader
in those articles of merchandize, which are prohibited
by the ordonnances of this nation. I 

have seen him lately at Bullogne, and am perfectly
well acquainted with some persons who
have supplied him with French lace and embroidery; 
and as a proof of what I alledge, I
desire you will order him and this barber, who
is his understrapper, to be examined on the
spot.” 
This charge, which was immediately explained
to the bench, yielded extraordinary
satisfaction to the spectators, one of whom,
being an officer of the customs, forthwith began
to exercise his function upon the unlucky
Perruquier, who being stripped of his upper
garments, and even of his shirt, appeared
like the mummy of an Egyptian king, most
curiously rolled up in bandages of rich, figured
gold shalloon, that covered the skirts of four
embrodered waistcoats. The merchant seeing
his expectation so unhappily reversed, made
an effort to retire with a most rueful aspect; 
but was prevented by the officer, who demanded
the interposition of the civil power, that
he might undergo the same examination, to
which the other had been subjected. He was
accordingly rifled without loss of time, and
the enquiry proved well worth the care of
him who made it; for, a considerable booty
of the same sort of merchandize was found in
his boots, breeches, hat, and between the
buchram and lining of his surtout. Yet not
contented with this prize, the experienced spoiler
proceeded to search his baggage, and perceiving
a false bottom in his portmanteau, detected
beneath it a valuable accession to the
plunder he had already obtained.
