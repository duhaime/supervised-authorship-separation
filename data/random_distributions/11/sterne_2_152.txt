'Tis a point settled,—and I mention
it for the comfort of †  Confucius,
who is apt to get entangled in telling a
plain story—that provided he keeps along
the line of his story,—he may go backwards
and forwards as he will,—'tis still
held to be no digression. 
This being premised, I take the benefit
of the act of going backwards myself.
