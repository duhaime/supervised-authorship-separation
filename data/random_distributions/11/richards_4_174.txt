My dearest Lady,
A Thousand Thanks for your Goodness
to me: But I hope all will be well. I hope
God will enable me to act so prudent a Part, as 

will touch his generous Breast. Be pleased to tell
me what your Ladyship has heard: But it becomes
not me, I think, till I cannot help it, to make any
Appeals; for, I know, those will not be excus'd; 
and I do all I can to suppress my Uneasiness before
him. But I pay for it, when I am alone. My
Nursery, and my Reliance on God, (I should have
said the latter first) are all my Consolation.â€” 
God preserve and bless you, my good Lady, and
my noble Lord; (but I am apt to think your Ladyship's
Presence will not avail) prays 
Your affectionate and obliged
P. B.
