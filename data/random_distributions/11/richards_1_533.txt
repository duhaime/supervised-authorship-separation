Mr. Belford, To Colonel Morden. 

Thursday, Sept. 21. 
Give me leave, dear Sir, to address myself to you
in a very serious and solemn manner on a subject
that I must not, cannot, dispense with; as I promised
the divine Lady, that I would do every-thing in my
power to prevent that further mischief of which she was
so very apprehensive. 
I will not content myself with distant hints. It is
with very great concern that I have just now heard of a
declaration which you are said to have made to your
relations at Harlowe-Place, That you will not rest till
you have avenged your Cousin's wrongs upon Mr. Lovelace. 
Far be it from me to offer to defend the unhappy
man, or even unduly to extenuate his crime! But yet I
must say, that the family, by their persecutions of the
dear Lady at first, and by their implacableness afterwards,
ought, at least, to share the blame with him. 
There is even great reason to believe, that a Lady of
such a religious turn, her virtue neither to be surprised
nor corrupted, her will inviolate, would have got over
a mere personal injury; especially as he would have done
all that was in his power to repair it; and as, from the
application of all his family in his favour, and other
circumstances attending his sincere and voluntary offer,
the Lady might have condescended, with greater glory
to herself, than if he had never offended. 
When I have the pleasure of seeing you next, I will
acquaint you, Sir, with all the circumstances of this
melancholy Story; from which you will see, that Mr.
Lovelace was extremely ill-treated at first, by the whole
family, this admirable Lady excepted. This exception, 

I know, heightens his crime: But as his principal intention
was but to try her virtue; and that he became
so earnest a suppliant to her for marriage; and as he has
suffered so deplorably in the loss of his reason, for not
having it in his power to repair her wrongs; I presume
to hope, that much is to be pleaded against such a resolution
as you are said to have made. 
I will read to you at the same time some passages from
Letters of his; two of which (one but this moment received)
will convince you, that the unhappy man, who
is but now recovering his intellects, needs no greater
punishment than what he has from his own reflections. 
I have just now re'd over the Copies of the dear Lady's
posthumous Letters. I send them all to you, except
that directed for Mr. Lovelace; which I reserve till I
have the pleasure of seeing you. Let me entreat you to
read once more that written to yourself; and that to
her Brother (a) ; which latter I now send you; as they
are in point to the present subject. 
I think, Sir, they are unanswerable. Such, at least,
is the effect they have upon me, that I hope I shall never
be provoked to draw my sword again in a private
quarrel. 
To the weight these must needs have upon you, let
me add, that the unhappy man has given no new occasion
of offence, since your visit to him at Lord M's,
when you were so well satisfied of his intention to atone
for his crimes, that you yourself urged to your dear
Cousin her forgiveness of him. 
Let me also (tho' I presume to hope there is no need,
when you coolly consider every-thing) remind you of
your own promise to your departing Cousin; relying
upon which, her last moments were the easier. 
Reflect, my dear Colonel Morden, that the highest
injury was to her: Her family all have a share in the
cause: She forgives it: Why should we not endeavour
to imitate what we admire? 

You asked me, Sir, when in town, If a brave man
could be a premeditatedly base one? â€”Generally speaking,
I believe Bravery and Baseness are incompatible. But
Mr. Lovelace's character, in the instance before us,
affords a proof of the truth of the common observation,
That there is no general rule but has its exceptions: 
For England, I believe, as gallant a nation as it is
deemed to be, has not in it a braver spirit than his; nor
a man who has greater skill at his weapons; nor more
calmness with his skill. 
I mention not this with a thought that it can affect
Col. Morden; who, if he be not with-held by SUPERIOR
Motives, as well as influenced by those I have
reminded him of, will tell me, That this skill, and this
bravery, will make him the more worthy of being
called upon by him. 
To these SUPERIOR motives then I refer myself: 
And with the greater confidence; as a pursuit ending in
blood would not, at this time, have the plea lie for it
with any-body, which sudden passion might have with
some: But would be construed by all, to be a cool and
deliberate act of revenge for an evil absolutely irretrievable: 
An act, of which a brave and noble spirit
(such as is the Gentleman's to whom I now write) is
not capable. 
Excuse me, Sir, for the sake of my executorial duty
and promise, keeping in eye the dear Lady's personal
injunctions, as well as written Will, enforced by Letters
posthumous. Every article of which (solicitous as we
both are to see it duly performed) she would have dispensed
with, rather than farther mischief should happen
on her account. I am, 
Dear Sir,
Your affectionate and faithful Servant,
J. Belford. 
The following is the posthumous Letter to Col. Morden,
referred to in the above.
