Discovers something which may serve to prove, that though love is the original source from which jealousy is derived, yet the latter of these passions is the most difficult of the two to be conceal'd, and also less under the government of reason. 
There are so many secret windings, such obscure recesses in the human mind, that it is very difficult, if not wholly impossible, for speculation to arrive at the real spring or first mover of any action whatsoever. 
How indeed should it be otherwise, as the most virtuous and the most vicious propensities of nature are frequently in a more or less degree lodged and blended together in the same composition, and both equally under the influence of a thousand different passions, which disguise and vary the face of their operations, so as not to be distinguish'd even by the persons themselves. 
It has already been observ'd, that there were some peculiarities in the humour and conduct of lady Speck, which she had policy and prudence enough to conceal entirely from the world; and though not the most intimate of her acquaintance, nor even her sister, could ever penetrate into the secret motives of a behaviour, which to them seem'd frequently pretty strange, it is fit the reader should not be deny'd that satisfaction, at least as far as the above-mentioned premises will admit. 
As her ladyship had found very little happiness in marriage, she had been too much rejoiced at being released from that bondage by the death of her husband, ever to think of entering into the same state a second time; but having observ'd that this was commonly the profession of 
all widows, and as commonly ridiculed by those who heard it, she forbore making any mention of her resolution in this point. 
She had very little vanity in her composition, but loved a variety of company;—she was pleas'd to find herself continually surrounded by a crowd of gentlemen; but had been equally, if not more so, if they had visited her on any other score than that of courtship: she behaved to each of them so much alike, that jealousy was a thing unknown among these rivals; and as none of them had any great cause to hope, so likewise none of them thought he had cause to despair of being one day the happy man; and her youth,—her beauty,—her wit,—her fortune, made her appear too valuable a prize not to persevere in the pursuit of. 
Thus easy, thus happy in herself, and delightful to all that saw her, did she live and reign the general toast and admiration of the town; when Celandine arriv'd from his travels, full frought with all those superficial accomplishments so enchanting to the unthinking part of the fair sex. 
What attracts the eye is too apt to have an influence over the heart;—his agreeable person,—his gaudy equipage, and the shew he made, dazzled the senses of even those who most affected to be thought wits;—he was the theme of every tea-table, and the chief object for whom the arts of the toylet were employ'd. 
Lady Speck had heard much of him before she saw him, but he was soon introduced to her acquaintance by a lady who frequently visited her, and had always spoke wonders in his praise; whether it were that she was prepossess'd by the good opinion she found others had of him, or whether it was to himself alone he was indebted for the impression he made on her is uncertain; but nothing can be more true, than that at first sight she felt for him what she had never done for any man after whole years of assiduity. 
It is also altogether as impossible to determine if it was by any kind looks he perceived in her towards him, or by the great confidence he had in his own merits, that he was emboldened to declare himself her lover; it was, however, either to the one or the other that she owed 
the triumph of this new conquest, and he had not made her many visits before she was confirm'd of it by the most violent protestations that tongue could utter. 
It seem'd, notwithstanding, extremely strange to her, that amidst all the testimonies he endeavour'd to give her of his love, he never once mention'd marriage; but, on the contrary, would frequently in her presence ridicule the institution,—say it was a clog upon inclinations, and only fit to link two people together who had no notion of the true joys of love, or of living politely in the world. 
He often had the impudence even to repeat to her, in justification of his prophane position, all the lines he could remember from any of the poets who had exercised their talents in satirising that sacred ceremony; particularly these of mr. Dryden: 
Marriage, thou curse of love, and snare of life!
That first debas'd a mistress to a wife!
Love, like a scene, at distance should appear,
But marriage views the gross-daub'd landscape near.

Love's nauseous cure! thou cloy'st whom thou should'st please,
And when that's cur'd, then thou art the disease;
When hearts are loose, thy chain our bodies ties;
Love couples friends, but marriage enemies.
But his behaviour on this score gave her not the least disgust towards him;—she was herself an enemy to marriage;—and besides his estate, though large, was not an equivalent for that she was in possession of; nor was any part of his character such as she thought becoming a man whom she would make a husband of;—she nevertheless loved him, nor took any pains to repel the kindness which every day grew stronger for him in her heart;—she was amused with his conversation, delighted with his addresses, look'd on him as a pretty plaything,—a charming toy which it would be doing too great a violence to her humour to throw away. 
All this will doubtless give the reader no very favourable idea of her virtue; but we will suppose it was only a platonic liking she had for him:—how far indeed, the dangerous liberties she 
allow'd herself to take with him might have carried her, if they had been continued much longer, no one can pretend to say. 
She was not, however, so much lost in the tender folly she indulg'd, as not to be perfectly sensible that the manner in which she conversed with Celandine could not, if known to the world, but occasion a great deal of discourse, little to the advantage of her reputation; and that it behoved her, above all things, to keep this secret of her soul from taking air:—to do this, she put in practice all the arts that a just fear of censure could inspire her with. —When Celandine was present with other company she affected to rally, and turn into bagatelle every thing he said or did; and when he was absent, to ridicule those vanities and fopperies which she had understanding enough to see in him, though not in reality to condemn him for. —She not only treated those gentlemen, who before made their addresses to her, with a greater shew of favour than she had been accustomed to do; but also encouraged every new offer of that kind that was presented to her; and this conduct proved effectual for the purpose she intended it, that no one person suspected Celandine was 
among the number of her lovers, much less that he was the darling favourite of her bosom. 
Being in this situation, it is easy to conceive what racks of mind she must sustain on the account that had been just given by mrs. M&wblank;&wblank;; —to be told that Celandine had an amour, and to hear it averr'd by the very woman who had been her rival, was a mere trifle in comparison with what follow'd;—that he was found in the close arbour with Jenny was the thing that stung her to the quick, when she remember'd that Celandine had met herself and sister in the walks, and how instead of squireing them as usual, he had only made a slight compliment and abruptly left them; and that Jenny had excused herself from going out on account of some letters she said she had to write, it appear'd plainly to her, that he went not from the walks but with a design of going to Jenny;—that she stay'd not at home but in expectation of his coming, and the appointment was previously agreed upon between them. 
Most women have naturally so good an opinion of themselves, as not to believe easily that the man who has once 
lov'd them can transfer his affections to another, without some very extraordinary arts put in practice for that purpose by the new object. —Lady Speck thought herself as handsome as Jenny, and therefore concluded that the amorous inclination which Celandine had all at once testified for that young lady, could be owing to nothing but some advances made to him on her part. 
How unjust and how cruel a passion is that of jealousy!—it destroys all the nobler principles of the foul,—it eraces thence all the ideas of virtue, religion, and morality; it makes us not only condemn the innocent, and acquit the guilty, but also inspires us with the most savage and inhuman sentiments. —Lady Speck now hated her fair friend more than ever she had loved her;—her beauty,—her wit,—all those accomplishments which had excited her esteem, render'd her now the object of her aversion;—she was almost tempted to wish mrs. M&wblank;&wblank; had perpetrated her outrageous design, if not to the destruction of her life, yet, to the defacing of those charms which had triumph'd over her in the heart of Celandine; and was little less angry with him for having prevented the fatal blow 
aimed against her rival, than she was for his falshood to herself. 
Of all the various agitations which by turns convulse and rend the human heart, there are none which instigate to more pernicious purposes, or bring on, if continued, more disastrous consequences; but the flame, however violent it may flash for the present, can have no long existence in a mind not wholly divested of all good nature and generosity;—cooler and more reasonable sentiments, on a little reflection, soon abated the force of those turbulent emotions which had taken possession of this lady's bosom; but as yet were not powerful enough to suppress them entirely; what effects follow'd, either of the one or the other, will hereafter appear,—but the conflict between them was for this time interrupted, by some company coming in, whom lady Speck was oblig'd to go down to receive, as they were more her guests than her sister's, and altogether strangers to Jenny.
