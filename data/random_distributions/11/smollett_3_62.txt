They depart from Ghent. Our hero engages in a
political dispute with his mistress, whom he offends,
and pacifies with submission. He practises
an expedient to detain the carriage at Alost,
and confirms the priest in his interest. 
Next day, about one o'clock, after having
seen every thing remarkable in town,
and been present at the execution of two youths,
who were hanged for ravishing a whore, they
took their departure from Ghent, in the same
carriage which had brought them thither; and
the conversation turning upon the punishment
they had seen inflicted, the Flemish beauty expressed
great sympathy and compassion for the
unhappy sufferers, who (as she had been informed)
had fallen victims to the malice of the accuser. 
Her sentiments were espoused by all the
company, except the French lady of pleasure,
who, thinking the credit of the sisterhood concerned
in the affair, bitterly inveighed against
the profligacy of the age, and particularly the
base and villainous attempts of man, upon the
chastity of the weaker sex; saying, with a look
of indignation directed to the painter, that for
her own part, she should never be able to manifest
the acknowledgment she owed to providence,
for having protected her, last night, from the
wicked aims of unbridled lust. This observation
introduced a series of jokes, at the expence of
Pallet, who hung his ears, and sat with a silent
air of dejection, fearing that through the malevolence
of the physician, his adventure might 

reach the ears of his wife. Indeed, though we
have made shift to explain the whole transaction
to the reader, it was an inextricable mystery to
every individual in the diligence; because the
part which was acted by the Capuchin, was
known to himself alone; and even he was utterly
ignorant of Pickle's being concerned in the
affair; so that the greatest share of the painter's
sufferings were supposed to be the exaggerations
of his own extravagant imagination. 
In the midst of their discourse on this extraordinary
subject, the driver told them, that they
were now on the very spot where a detachment
of the allied army had been intercepted and cut
off by the French; and stopping the vehicle, entertained
them with a local description of the
battle of Melle. Upon this occasion, the Flemish
lady, who since her marriage had become a keen
partizan for the French, gave a minute detail of
all the circumstances, as they had been represented
to her by her husband's brother, who was
in the action; and this account, which sunk the
number of the French to sixteen, and raised that
of the allies to twenty thousand men, was so disagreeable
to truth, as well as to the laudable
partiality of Peregrine, that he ventured to contradict
her assertions, and a fierce dispute commenced,
that not only regarded the present question,
but also comprehended all the battles in
which the duke of Marlborough had commanded
against Lewis the fourteenth. In the course of
these debates, she divested that great general of
all the glory he had acquired, by affirming, that
every victory he gained, was purposely lost by
the French generals, in order to bring the schemes
of madam de Maintenon into discredit; and as a 

particular instance, alledged that while the citadel
of Lisle was besieged, Lewis said, in presence of
the Dauphin, that if the allies should be obliged to
raise the siege, he would immediately declare his
marriage with that lady; upon which, the son
sent private orders to marshal Boufflers to surrender
the place. This strange allegation was supported
by the asseverations of the priest and the
courtezan, and admitted as truth by the governor,
who pretended to have heard it from good
authority: while the doctor sat neutral, as one
who thought it scandalous to know the history of
such modern events; and the Israelite, being a
true Dutchman, listed himself under the banners
of our hero, who in attempting to demonstrate
the absurdity and improbability of what they had
advanced, raised such a hue and cry against himself,
and being insensibly heated in the altercation,
irritated his Amanda to such a degree, that
her charming eyes kindled with fury, and he saw
great reason to think, that if he did not fall upon
some method to deprecate her wrath, she would
in a twinkling sacrifice all her esteem for him,
to her own zeal for the glory of the French nation. 
Swayed by this apprehension, his ardour
cooled by degrees, and he insensibly detached
himself from the argument, leaving the whole
care of supporting it on the Jew, who finding
himself deserted, was fain to yeild at discretion; 
so that the French remained masters of the field,
and their young heroine resumed her good humour. 
And let the circumstances of this contention
warn the reader, against all disputes with female
politicians; unless he is desirous of incuring
their animosity and implacable resentment; 
for, in matters of state, they are all, to a woman, 

enthusiasts, who believe that all those who
differ from them in opinion, are in a state of reprobation; 
and, far from laying any stress upon
probability, in the articles of their faith, like believers
of another class, disdainfully reject the
evidence of reason, and trust to the revelation of
their own fancy. 
Our hero having therefore prudently submitted
to the superior intelligence of his fair enslaver,
began to be harrassed with the fears of
losing her for ever, upon their arrival at Brussels,
and set his invention at work, to contrive some
means of indemnifying himself for his assiduities,
presents, and the disappointment he had already
undergone, before they should reach that city:
on pretence of enjoying a freer air, he mounted
the box, and employed his elocution and generosity
with such success, that the driver undertook
to disable the Diligence from proceeding
beyond the town of Alost for that day; and in
consequence of his promise, gently overturned it,
when they were about a mile short of that baiting
place. He had taken his measures so discreetly,
that this accident was attended with no
other inconvenience than a fit of fear, that took
possession of the ladies, and the necessity to which
they were reduced, by the declaration of the
coachman, who, upon examining the carriage,
assured the company that the axle-tree had given
way, and advised them to walk forward to the
inn, while he would jog after them at a slow
pace, and do his endeavour that the damage
should be immediately repaired. Peregrine pretended
to be very much concerned at what had
happened, and even cursed the driver for his inadvertency,
expressing infinite impatience to be 

at Brussels, and wishing that this misfortune
might not detain them another night upon the
road; but when his understapper, according to
his instructions, came afterwards to the inn, and
gave them to understand, that the workman he
had employed, could not possibly refit the machine
in less than six hours, the crafty youth affected
to lose all temper, stormed at his emissary,
whom he reviled in the most opprobious
terms, and threatened to cane for his misconduct. 
The fellow protested, with great humility, that
their being overturned was owing to the failure
of the axle-tree, and not to his want of care or
dexterity in driving; though rather than be
thought the cause of incommoding him, he would
inquire for a post-chaise, in which he might depart
for Brussels immediately. This expedient
Pickle rejected, unless the whole company could
be accommodated in the same manner; and he
had been previously informed by the driver, that
the town could not furnish more than one vehicle
of that sort. His governor, who was quite
ignorant of his scheme, represented that one
night would soon be passed, and exhorted him to
bear this small disappointment with a good grace,
especially as the house seemed to be well provided
for their entertainment, and the company
so much disposed to be sociable. The Capuchin,
who had found his account in cultivating the acquaintance
of the young stranger, was not ill-pleased
at this event, which might, by protracting
the term of their intercourse, yield him some
opportunity of profiting still further by his liberality:
he therefore joined Mr. Jolter in his admonitions,
congratulating himself upon the prospect
of enjoying his conversation a little longer 

than he had expected; and our young gentleman
received a compliment to the same purpose from
the Hebrew, who had that day exercised his gallantry
upon the French coquette, and was not
without hope of reaping the fruits of his attention,
his rival, the painter, being quite disgraced
and dejected by the adventure of last night. As
for the doctor, he was too much engrossed in the
contemplation of his own importance, to interest
himself in the affair, or its consequences, further
than by observing, that the European powers
ought to establish public games, like those that
were celebrated of old in Greece; in which case,
every state would be supplied with such dextrous
charioteers, as could drive a machine at full
speed, within a hair's breadth of a precipice, without
any danger of its being overthrown. Peregrine
could not help yielding to their remonstrances,
and united complaisance, for which he thanked
them in very polite terms, and his passion seeming
to subside, proposed that they should amuse
themselves in walking round the ramparts, with
a view of enjoying some private conversation
with his admired Fleming, who had this whole
day behaved with remarkable reserve. The
proposal being embraced, he (as usual) handed
her into the street, and took all opportunities of
promoting his suit; but they were attended so
closely by her father confessor, that he foresaw it
would be impracticable to accomplish his aim,
without the connivance of that ecclesiastick,
which he was obliged to purchase with another
purse, that he offered, and was accepted as a
charitable atonement for his criminal behaviour
during the interview which the friar had procured
for the good of his soul. This benefaction 

was no sooner made, than the pious mendicant
edged off by little and little, till he joined the
rest of the company, leaving his generous patron
at full liberty to prosecute his purpose. It is not
to be doubted that our adventurer made a good
use of this occasion: he practised a thousand
flowers of rhetoric, and actually exhausted his
whole address, in persuading her to have compassion
upon his misery, and indulge him with
another private audience, without which he
should run distracted, and be guilty of extravagancies,
which, in the humanity of her disposition,
she would weep to see. But, instead of
complying with his request, she chid him severely
for his presumption, in persecuting her with his
vicious addresses; and assured him, that although
she had secured a chamber for herself in this
place, because she had no ambition to be better
acquainted with the other lady, he would be in
the wrong to disturb her with another nocturnal
visit; for she was determined to deny him admittance. 
The lover was comforted by this
hint, which he understood in the true acceptation,
and his passion being inflamed by the obstacles
he had met with in this intrigue, his heart
beat high with the prospect of possession. These
raptures of expectation produced an inquietude,
which disabled him from bearing that share of
the conversation for which he used to be distinguished. 
His behaviour at supper was a vicissitude
of startings, and reveries; and the Capuchin
imputing this disorder to a second repulse
from his charge, began to be invaded with the
apprehension of being obliged to refund, and in
a whisper forbad our hero to despair.
