A little more to the purpose. 
Jemmy knew that his fair mistress kept a great deal of company, and that most of her afternoons were taken up with giving and receiving visits;—whenever, therefore, he had any particular conversation to entertain her with, he always went to her in a morning; the business he had now to communicate seeming to him of too much importance to be delay'd, his impatience carried him thither more early than was his custom; yet had he not the satisfaction of finding her alone; the two lovely daughters of mrs. G&wblank; were just gone up stairs before him; but he was not much disconcerted at their presence, as he saw they were in their deshabillee, and he could not doubt but that the hour of the day would soon call them home, in order to ornament those charms which were too much admired not to make them desirous of shewing them to the best advantage, whenever they appeared in public places, which they seldom or rather never fail'd to take all opportunities of doing. 
These ladies, whose history it is probable will some time or other make a very interesting figure in the world, were distinguish'd more by the name of the two beautiful sisters, than by that of their family; they were, indeed, lovely beyond what language can describe, or fancy, without seeing them, delineate; both of them were tall, finely shaped, of a most graceful air, had the most regular features; eyes at once commanding and attracting love and admiration; and so equally had nature dealt her bounties to them, that hard it is to say which of them excell'd in any one of those perfections which each possess'd in so lavish an abundance. 
But being so alike beautiful was certainly a misfortune to them; for each seeming most lovely when the other was away, yet neither of them having the preference when together, the beholder's eye was kept in a continual motion, without knowing on which to fix; and this it was, which, join'd with some other considerations not my business to enquire into, that perhaps kept them much longer from being married, than many who have not the thousandth part of their power of charming. 
This consideration, however, seem'd to have but little weight with them; they lived in the most perfect harmony, were rarely seen asunder,—whether at the play, the opera,—the court,—the mall,—vauxhall,—ranelagh, in all places of resort they were inseparable as the twin stars that grace the zodiac. 
In fine, so much the same in every respect was this pair of charmers, that if mr. Waller had lived in their days, one would have imagined he could have no other in his eye when he wrote these lines: 
Not the silver Doves that fly,
 Yoak'd in Cytharea's car;
Not the wings which soar so high,
 And convey her son so far,
Are so lovely, sweet and fair,
 Or do more ennoble love,
Are so choicely match'd a pair,
 Or with more consent to move.
Fortunately for Jemmy's design, it so fell out that the conversation turn'd chiefly on the subject of gaming on account of a certain lady, who having no more than five and twenty hundred pounds per annum, had, according to her own confession, lost nine thousand in one season at play. 
Jenny express'd, with so much warmth and spirit, the contempt she had of those who made a kind of business, or trade, as it were of this amusement, as sufficiently denoted the sincerity of her heart, while she was speaking, and gave Jemmy an infinite satisfaction in hearing her. 
The two beautiful sisters made but a very short visit, as Jemmy had conjectured, and after they were gone, he resumed the topic they had all been talking on; ‘You women, said he smiling, have much the advantage over us men; some of you, at least, have been ingenious enough to have found out a very easy method of discharging all the debts they contract at play: I could give you, continued he, a thousand instances of what I say; but shall content myself with only one, in which a friend of mine made me the confidant, and on whose veracity I dare as much depend, as if I had been in his place, and one of the chief parties concern'd in it.’ 
Finding Jenny look'd earnestly upon him all the time he had been speaking, and seem'd in a disposition to give attention to every thing he said upon that subject, he went on, and related to her, with as much brevity and modesty as such an affair would permit, all that had pass'd between himself, Liberia, and the other gentleman, who had been a sharer with him in the favour of that lady, hiding from her only the names and some few circumstances which might have given her room to guess more than he wish'd she should do. 
Jenny was shock'd to the very soul at this recital; she had been witness of many extravagancies that women, who devote themselves to gaming, are often guilty of; she knew very well that they reduced themselves to great streights, sometimes even to the total ruin of their own and husbands fortune; but could never have imagined that any of them, merely for the sake of play, would have proceeded to those frightful lengths she now was told of. 
After having expressed some part of her astonishment and indignation at such a depravity of nature, ‘How ought, cried she, every one to guard against the first approaches of this dangerous propensity! and then again, bless me! added she, how can any one, who has a tongue to speak, and common sense to dictate what they say, lavish those hours in gaming, which might be pass'd in an agreeable and improving conversation! If no other ill consequences than bearly loss of time attended it, methinks it were enough to hinder any one, not altogether void of reason, from pursuing, with the eagerness some do, an amusement at the best trifling and idle.’ 
It is not to be doubted but that Jemmy was quite transported, at finding in his fair mistress sentiments so just and so exactly conformable to those he had, with the greatest ardency, wish'd she should be inspired with; he had no words which seem'd to him sufficient to praise, as they deserved, her prudence and penetration, yet said enough on that occasion to put her modesty to the blush. 
‘Do not fancy me to be possess'd of more merit than I have, answer'd she; I believe that many of our sex, with as little inclination as myself to play, have been enticed to it by the examples of those whom we are so silly as to think it an honour to imitate, even in their vices; whatever we see practised by those of the great world becomes a law to us of the inferior class; and I can tell you, that it is not to my own judgment, but to mere accident, that I am brought to a more reasonable way of thinking. 
‘You must know, continued she, that a lady, who is a distant relation of mine, took me with her one evening to the route of a person of condition; there was a prodigious deal of company, three large rooms made into one, and no less than fourteen tables set out for different sorts of gaming;—every body played, and though I never was fond of cards, yet was ashamed, in so public an assembly, not to do as others did, so engaged myself with a party who were sitting down to whist: either through want of skill, or attention, I soon lost twenty pieces, which was all I had about me at that time; but having no notion of giving over, as the others were for continuing, I went to my cousin, who was at quadrille at another table, in order to get a fresh supply from her; but, to my great mortification, found she was entirely stript as well as myself; there was none of the company, with whom I was intimate enough to become a borrower. 
‘I must confess, pursued she, that I then was silly enough to be heartily vex'd at this disappointment, and retired to the other end of the room, debating within myself whether I should go quite away, or stay to see how my cousin would behave, who I found was still at play with the same party she had been engaged in. As I was in this perplexity, the earl of ***, who had betted at our table, and been witness both of my ill luck and present confusion, came towards me, and putting a purse, that seem'd very weighty, into my hand, which he held fast grasp'd between both his,—It is pity, said he, that so fine a young lady should be deprived of her diversion on any account whatever, much less on that of a little paultry cash; accept these few pieces, they may be more lucky to you than your own; but if it prove otherwise, command as many from me as you shall stand in need of. 
‘I protest to you, went she still on, that I was so confounded at finding myself accosted in this manner, that I had neither courage nor presence of mind enough to resent at first so impudent an overture, as I ought to have done; and it was the simplicity of my behaviour which, perhaps, encouraged him to proceed; for I only asking what his lordship meant, he reply'd with an air and voice sufficiently explanatory of the base thoughts he had of me,’ ‘I mean to devote myself, and all I have, at the altar of your charms; happy if you smile upon the sacrifice.’ 
‘Never was any poor creature so overwhelm'd with different passions as I then was; amazement, shame, disdain, and rage, at once rose in my bosom, and almost stopp'd the passage of my breath. I forgot all respect of his birth and place; and throwing the purse he had given me upon the floor,—carry your offers, said I, to those who want them, I despise both them and the hand from which they came. 
‘With these words I burst from him and rejoin'd the company; my cousin was still playing, having borrow'd of some person she was acquainted with, and I kept leaning over the back of her chair all the time we stay'd; his lordship pass'd by me more than once, and discover'd by his looks that he was no less affronted at my behaviour than I had been at his, which, contrary to what it is likely his vanity might make him imagine, gave me more satisfaction than discontent. 
‘I was, however, very much agitated to think that any man, how great soever, had dared to treat me with the freedom he had done; on coming home I complained of it to my cousin, but she only ridiculed me for it; told me I was a novice in the ways of the town; that if she had been in my place, she would have taken his money and laugh'd at him afterwards for bestowing it; for which I liked her so ill, that I have ever since avoided her as much as possible. 
‘Thus you see, my dear Jemmy,’ added she, on concluding her little narrative, ‘that my dislike of gaming is not owing to my prudence in considering the folly of it, for I confess I never thought much about the matter, but merely to my lord ***'s behaviour; for certainly no young woman of common modesty, if treated as I was, will ever indulge herself in an amusement that renders her virtue liable to be exposed to such insolent attacks.’ 
It was not in the power of all she could say, however, to make Jemmy desist from giving her the praises she deserved, nor from entertaining in his mind the most high idea of her understanding, as well as her virtue, insomuch, that could he have thought himself equally qualified in what might be expected from a husband, as she was in every thing that could be wish'd for in a wife, he would have seen no reason for delaying their mutual happiness one moment. 
But a just consciousness of some little frailties, which afforded him too much pleasure to be able as yet to rectify, made him forbear to press her on the subject of their marriage for the present.
