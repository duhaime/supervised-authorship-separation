Sir Charles Grandison, To Lady Clementina. 
[Under Cover, directed as before.] 


Friday morn. Febr. 16. 
To the questions of dear Lady Clementina I answer
thusâ€”I will endeavour to prevail upon your parents,
and other friends, to leave you absolutely free
to choose your own state, without using either compulsion,
or over-earnest persuasion. 
Who, madam, can forbid the Count of Belvedere
to hope? Leave him hope. If he has not the overearnest
entreaties of your own relations to give weight
to his addresses, it will be in your power to give him
either encouragement or despair. 
I will engage for the joyful reconciliation to her of
all the dear Clementina's friends. I am sure I can. 
Laura shall be forgiven, and provided for by an annuity
equal to her wages, if the continuance of her
service be not accepted. 
I will myself entertain your young man; and place
and reward him according to his merits. 
And now, madam, admit to the honour of your
presence, 
Your Brother, your Friend, your ever-grateful
and affectionate humble Servant,
Charles Grandison.
