A Dialogue between the Ordinary of
Newgate and Mr. Jonathan Wild
the Great: In which the Subjects
of Death, Immortality, and other
grave Matters, are very learnedly
handled by the former. 
Ordinary.
Good Morrow to you, Sir; I hope
you rested well last Night. 
Jonathan.
D&wblank;n'd ill, Sir. I dreamt so confoundedly
of hanging, that it disturbed my
Sleep. 
Ordinary.
Fie upon it. You should be more resigned. 
I wish you would make a little
better Use of those Instructions which I have
endeavoured to inculcate into you, and particularly
last Sunday, and from those Words: 

Those who do Evil shall go into everlasting
Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels,
I undertook to shew you, First, What
is meant by EVERLASTING FIRE; 
and, Secondly, Who were THE DEVIL
AND HIS ANGELS. I then proceeded
to draw some Inferences from the
whole a ; in which I am mightily deceived,
if I did not convince you, that you yourself
was one of those ANGELS; and,
consequently, must expect EVERLASTING
FIRE to be your Portion in the
other World. 
Jonathan.
Faith, Doctor, I remember very little
of your Inferences; for I fell asleep soon
after your naming your Text: But did you
preach this Doctrine then, or do you repeat
it now, in order to comfort me? 
Ordinary.
I do it, in order to bring you to a true Sense
of your manifold Sins, and, by that Means, to
induce you to Repentance. Indeed, had I 

the Eloquence of Cicero, or of Tully, it
would not be sufficient to describe the
Pains of Hell, or the Joys of Heaven. The
utmost that we are taught is, that Ear
hath not heard, nor can Heart conceive. 
Who then would, for the pitiful Consideration
of the Riches and Pleasures of this
World, forfeit such inestimable Happiness! 
Such Joys! Such Pleasures! Such Delights!
Or who would run the Venture of such
Misery, which, but to think on, shocks
the human Understanding! Who, in his
Senses, then would prefer the latter to the
former? 
Jonathan.
Ay, who indeed! I assure you, Doctor, I
had much rather be happy than miserable.

Despair is sinful. You should place your
Hopes in Repentance and Grace; and
though, it is most true, you are in Danger
of the Judgment; yet there is still Room
for Mercy, and no Man, unless excommunicated,
is absolutely without Hopes of a
Reprieve. 
Jonathan.
I am not without Hopes of a Reprieve
from the Cheat yet: I have pretty good Interest; 

but if I cannot obtain it, you shall
not frighten me out of my Courage, I will
not die like a Pimp. D&wblank;n me what
is Death? It is nothing but to be with
Plato's and with Cœsars,—as the Poet
says, and all the other great Heroes of Antiquity.

Ay, all this is very true; but Life is
sweet for all that, and I had rather live to
Eternity, than go into the Company of any
such Heathens, who are, I doubt not, in
Hell with the Devil and his Angels; and,
as little as you seem to apprehend it, you
may find yourself there before you expect
it. Where then will be your Tauntings
and your Vauntings, your Boastings and
your Braggings? You will then be ready
to give more for a Drop of Water than
you ever gave for a Bottle of Wine. 
Jonathan.
Faith, Doctor, well minded. What
say you to a Bottle of Wine? 

Ordinary.
I will drink no Wine with an Atheist. 
I should expect the Devil to make a
third in such Company; for, since he knows
you are his, he may be impatient to have
his Due. 
Jonathan.
It is your Business to drink with the
Wicked, in order to amend them. 
Ordinary.
I despair of it; and so I consign you over
to the Devil, who is ready to receive you. 
Jonathan.
You are more unmerciful to me than the
Judge, Doctor. He recommended my
Soul to Heaven; and it is your Office to
shew me the Way thither. 
Ordinary.
No: The Gates are barred against all
Revilers of the Clergy. 

Jonathan.
I revile only the wicked ones, if any such
are, which cannot affect you, who, if Men
were preferred in the Church by Merit only,
would have long since been a Bishop. 
Indeed, it might raise any good Man's Indignation
to observe one of your vast Learning
and Abilities obliged to exert them in
so low a Sphere, when so many of your
Inferiors wallow in Wealth and Preferment. 
Ordinary.
Why, it must be confest, there are bad
Men in all Orders; but you should not
censure too generally. I must own, I might
have expected higher Promotion; but I
have learnt Patience and Resignation; and
I would advise you to the same Temper of
Mind, which, if you can attain, I know
you will find Mercy; nay, I do now promise
you, you will. It is true, you are a
Sinner; but your Crimes are not of the
blackest Dye: You are no Murtherer, nor
guilty of Sacrilege. And if you are guilty
of Theft, you make some Attonement by 

suffering for it, which many others do not. 
Happy is it indeed for those few who are
detected in their Sins, and brought to exemplary
Punishment for them in this
World. So far, therefore, from repining
at your Fate when you come to the
Tree, you should exult and rejoice in it; 
and, to say the Truth, I question whether,
to a wise Man, the Catastrophe of many a
Man who dies by a Halter, is not more to
be envied than pitied. Nothing is so sinful
as Sin, and Murther is the greatest of all
Sins; it follows, that whoever commits
Murther is happy in suffering for it; if
therefore a Man who commits Murther is
so happy in dying for it, how much better
must it be for you, who have committed a
less Crime. 
Jonathan.
All this is very true; but let us take a
Bottle of Wine to cheer our Spirits. 
Ordinary.
Why Wine? Let me tell you, Mr.
Wild, there is nothing so deceitful as the
Spirits given us by Wine. If you must 

drink, let us have a Bowl of Punch; a Liquor
I the rather prefer, as it is no where
spoken against in Scripture, and as it is
more wholsome for the Gravel; a Distemper
with which I am grievously afflicted. 
Jonathan (having called for a Bowl.)
I ask your Pardon, Doctor, I should have
remembered, that Punch was your favourite
Liquor. I think you never taste Wine
while there is any Punch remaining on the
Table. 
Ordinary.
I confess, I look on Punch to be the more
eligible Liquor, as well for the Reasons I
have before mentioned, as likewise for one
other Cause, viz. it is the properest for a
Draught. I own I took it a little unkind
of you to mention Wine, thinking you knew
my Palate. 
Jonathan.
You are in the right; and I will take a
swinging Cup to your being made a Bishop. 

Ordinary.
And I will wish you a Reprieve in as
large a Draught. Come, don't despair: It
is yet Time enough to think of dying, you
have good Friends, who very probably may
prevail for you. I have known many a
Man reprieved, who had less Reason to expect
it. 
Jonathan.
But, if I should flatter myself with such
Hopes, and be deceived, what then would
become of my Soul? 
Ordinary.
Pugh! Never mind your Soul, leave
that to me; I will render a good Account
of it, I warrant you. I have a Sermon in
my Pocket, which may be of some Use to
you to hear. I do not value myself on the
Talent of Preaching, since no Man ought
to value himself for any Gift in this World: 
But perhaps there are not many such Sermons. 
—But to proceed, since we have
nothing else to do till the Punch comes. 

—My Text is the latter Part of a Verse
only. 
—To the Greeks Foolishness.
The Occasion of these Words was principally,
that Philosophy of the Greeks which
at that Time had over-run great Part of the
Heathen World, had poisoned, and as it
were puffed up their Minds with Pride, so
that they disregarded all Kinds of Doctrine
in Comparison of their own; and however
safe, and however sound the Learning of
others might be, yet, if it any wise contradicted
their own Laws, Customs, and received
Opinions, away with it, it is not for
us. It was to the Greeks Foolishness. 
In the former Part therefore of my Discourse
on these Words, I shall principally
confine myself to the laying open and demonstrating
the great Emptiness and Vanity
of this Philosophy, with which these
idle and absurd Sophists were so proudly
blown up and elevated: 

And here I shall do two Things: First,
I shall expose the Matter; and secondly,
The Manner of this absurd Philosophy. 
And First, for the First of these, namely
the Matter. Now here we may retort the
unmannerly Word, which our Adversaries
have audaciously thrown in our Faces; for
what was all this mighty Matter of Philosophy,
this Heap of Knowledge, which was
to bring such large Harvests of Honour to
those who sowed it, and so greatly and nobly
enrich the Ground on which it fell; 
what was it, but Foolishness? An inconsistent
Heap of Nonsense, of Absurdities
and Contradictions, bringing no Ornament
to the Mind in its Theory, nor exhibiting
any Usefulness to the Body in its
Practice. What were all the Sermons and
the Sayings, the Fables and the Morals of
all these wise Men, but, to use the Word
mentioned in my Text once more, Foolishness? 
What was their great Master
Plato, or their other great Light Aristotle? 
Mere Quibblers and Sophists, idly and
vainly attached to certain ridiculous Notitions
of their own, founded neither on Truth 

nor Reason. Their whole Works are a
strange Medley of the greatest Falshoods,
scarce covered over with the Colour of
Truth: Their Precepts are neither borrowed
from Nature, nor guided by Reason: 
Mere Fictions, serving only to evince the
dreadful Height of human Pride. It may
be, perhaps, expected of me, that I should
give some Instances from their Works to
prove this Charge; but as, to transcribe
every Passage tending to prove what I have
here asserted, would be to transcribe their
whole Works, and as in such a plentiful
Crop, it is difficult to chuse; instead of trespassing
on your Patience, I shall conclude
this first Head with a small Alteration of
the Words of my Text. The Philosophy
of the Greeks was Foolishness. 
Proceed we now in the second Place,
to consider the Manner in which this inane
and simple Doctrine was propagated. 
And here—But here, the Punch by entring
put a Stop to his Reading at this time: 
Nor could we obtain of Mr. Wild any further
Account of the Conversation which
past at this Interview.
