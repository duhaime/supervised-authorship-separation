Mr. Belford, To Robert Lovelace, Esq; 

Monday, Aug. 14. 
I am extremely concerned for thy illness. I should be
very sorry to lose thee. Yet, if thou diest so soon, I
could wish, from my soul, it had been before the beginning
of last April: And this as well for thy sake, as for the sake
of the most excellent woman in the world: For then thou
wouldst not have had the most crying sin of thy life to answer
for. 
I was told on Saturday, that thou wert very much out
of order; and this made me forbear writing till I heard
further. Harry, on his return from thee, confirmed the 

bad way thou art in. But I hope Lord M. in his unmerited
tenderness for thee, thinks the worst of thee. What can it
be, Bob? A violent fever, they say; but attended with
odd and severe symptoms. 
I will not trouble thee, in the way thou art in, with
what passes here with Miss Harlowe. I wish thy repentance
as swift as thy illness; and as efficacious, if thou diest; 
for it is else to be feared, that She and You will never
meet in one place. 
I told her how ill you are. Poor man! said she. Dangerously
ill, say you? 
Dangerously indeed, Madam! —So Lord M. sends me
word! 
God be merciful to him, if he die! said the admirable
creature. —Then, after a pause, Poor wretch! —May he
meet with the mercy he has not shewn! 
I send this by a special messenger: For I am impatient
to hear how it goes with thee. —If I have received thy
last letter, what melancholy reflections will that last, so
full of shocking levity, give to 
Thy true Friend,
John Belford.
