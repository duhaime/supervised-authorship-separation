Miss Clarissa Harlowe, To Miss Howe. 

Sunday Morning, Seven o'Clock. 
I was at the Play last night with Mr. Lovelace and
Miss Horton. It is, you know, a deep and most
affecting Tragedy in the reading. You have my
Remarks upon it, in the little book you made me
write upon the principal acting Plays. You will not
wonder, that Miss Horton, as well as I, was greatly
moved at the Representation, when I tell you, and
have some pleasure in telling you, that Mr. Lovelace
himself was very sensibly touched with some of the
most affecting Scenes. I mention this in praise of
the author's performance; for I take M. Lovelace to
be one of the most hard-hearted men in the world. 
Upon my word, my dear, I do. 
His behaviour, however, on this occasion and on
our return, was unexceptionable; only that he would 

oblige me to stay to supper with the women below,
when we came back, and to sit up with him and them
till near One o'clock this morning. I was resolved to
be even with him; and indeed I am not very sorry to
have the pretence; for I love to pass the Sundays by
myself. 
To have the better excuse to avoid his teazing, I
am ready dressed to go to church this morning. I will
go only to St. James's Church, and in a chair; that I
may be sure I can go out and come in when I please,
without being intruded upon by him, as I was twice
before. 
Near Nine o'clock. 
I have your kind Letter of yesterday. He knows
I have. And I shall expect, that he will be inquisitive
next time I see him after your opinion of his
proposals. I doubted not your approbation of them,
and had written an answer on that presumption; 
which is ready for him. He must study for occasions
of procrastination, and to disoblige me, if now anything
happen to set us at variance again. 
He is very importunate to see me. He has desired
to attend me to church. He is angry that I have declined
to breakfast with him. I am sure that I should
not have been at my own liberty if I had. –––I bid
Dorcas tell him, that I desired to have this day to myself. 
I would see him in the morning as early as he
pleased. She says, she knows not what ails him, but
that he is out of humour with every-body. 
He has sent again in a peremptory manner. He
warns me of Singleton. I sent him word, that if he was
not afraid of Singleton at the Play-house last night, I
need not at Church to-day: So many Churches to one
Play-house. I have accepted of his servant's proposed
attendance. But he is quite displeased, it seems. I
don't care. I will not be perpetually at his insolent
beck. —Adieu, my dear, till I return. The chair
waits. He won't stop me, sure, as I go down to it. 

* *
I did not see him as I went down. He is, it
seems, excessively out of humour. Dorcas says, Not
with me neither, she believes: But something has
vexed him. This is put on perhaps to make me dine
with him. But I will not, if I can help it. I shan't
get rid of him for the rest of the day, if I do. 
* *
He was very earnest to dine with me. But I was
resolved to carry this one small point; and so denied
to dine myself. And indeed I was endeavouring to
write to my Cousin Morden; and had begun three
different times, without being able to please myself. 
He was very busy in writing, Dorcas says; and pursued
it without dining, because I denied him my company. 
He afterwards demanded, as I may say, to be admitted
to afternoon-tea with me: And appealed by
Dorcas to his behaviour to me last night; as if, as I
sent him word by her, he thought he had a merit in
being unexceptionable. However, I repeated my promise
to meet him as early as he pleased in the morning,
or to breakfast with him. 
Dorcas says, he raved: I heard him loud, and I
heard his servant fly from him, as I thought. You,
my dearest friend, say, in one of yours (a) , that you
must have somebody to be angry at, when your Mother
sets you up. I should be very loth to draw comparisons: 
But the workings of passion, when indulged,
are but too much alike, whether in man or woman. 
* *
He has just sent me word, that he insists upon supping
with me. As we had been in a good train for
several days past, I thought it not prudent to break
with him for little matters. Yet, to be, in a manner,
threatened into his will, I know not how to bear
that. 
* *

While I was considering, he came up, and, tapping
at my door, told me, in a very angry tone, he
must see me this night. He could not rest, till he had
been told what he had done to deserve the treatment
I gave him. 
Treatment I give him! —A wretch! —Yet perhaps
he has nothing new to say to me. I shall be very angry
with him. 
As the Lady could not know what Mr. Lovelace's designs
were, nor the cause of his ill humour, it will
not be improper to pursue the subject from his Letter. 
Having described his angry manner of demanding, in
person, her company at supper; he proceeds as
follows: 
'Tis hard, answered the fair Perverse, that I am
to be so little my own mistress. I will meet you in
the Dining-room half an hour hence. 
I went down to wait that half-hour. All the women
set me hard to give her cause for this tyranny. 
They demonstrated, as well from the nature of the
Sex, as of the Case, that I had nothing to hope for
from my tameness, and could meet with no worse
treatment, were I to be guilty of the last offence. They
urged me vehemently to try at least what effect some
greater familiarities than I had ever taken with her,
would have: And their arguments being strengthened
by my just resentments on the discoveries I had made,
I was resolved to take some liberties, and, as they were
received, to take still greater, and lay all the fault
upon her tyranny. In this humour I went up, and
never had Paralytic so little command of his joints,
as I had, while I walked about the Dining-room, attending
her motions. 
With an erect mien she entered, her face averted,
her lovely bosom swelling, and the more charmingly
protuberant for the erectness of her mien. O Jack!
that Sullenness and Reserve should add to the charms of 

this haughty maid! But in every attitude, in every
humour, in every gesture, is Beauty beautiful. —By her
averted face, and indignant aspect, I saw the dear Insolent
was disposed to be angry—But by the fierceness
of mine, as my trembling hands seized hers,
I soon made Fear her predominant passion. And
yet the moment I beheld her, my heart was dastardized; 
and my reverence for the Virgin Purity so
visible in her whole deportment, again took place. 
Surely, Belford, this is an Angel. And yet, had
she not been known to be a Female, they would
not from babyhood have dressed her as such, nor
would she, but upon that conviction, have continued
the dress. 
Let me ask you, Madam, I beseech you tell me,
what I have done to deserve this distant treatment? 
And let me ask you, Mr. Lovelace, why are my
Retirements to be thus invaded? –––What can you have
to say to me since last night, that I went with you so
much against my will to the Play? And after sitting up
with you, equally against my will, till a very late
hour? 
This I have to say, Madam, that I cannot bear to be
kept at this distance from you under the same roof. 
Under the same roof, Sir! –––How came you––– 
Hear me out, Madam [letting go her trembling
hands, and snatching them back again with an eagerness
that made her start]–––I have a thousand things to
say, to talk of, relating to our present and future prospects; 
but when I want to open my whole soul to you,
you are always contriving to keep me at a distance. 
You make me inconsistent with myself. Your heart
is set upon delays. You must have views that you
will not own. Tell me, Madam, I conjure you to
tell me, this moment, without subterfuge or reserve,
in what light am I to appear to you in future? I
cannot bear this distance. The suspense you hold me
in I cannot bear. 

In what light, Mr. Lovelace! [visibly terrified] In
no bad light, I hope—Pray, Mr. Lovelace, do not
grasp my hands so hard [endeavouring to withdraw
them]. Pray let me go.— 
You hate me, Madam— 
I hate nobody, Sir— 
You hate me, Madam, repeated I. 
Instigated and resolved, as I came up, I wanted
some new provocation. The devil indeed, as soon
as my angel made her appearance, crept out of my
heart; but he had left the door open, and was no
farther off than my elbow. 
You come up in no good temper, I see, Mr.
Lovelace—But pray be not violent—I have done you
no hurt—Pray be not violent— 
Sweet creature! And I clasped one arm about her,
holding one hand in my other—You have done me no
hurt! —I could have devoured her—But restraining
myself—You have done me the greatest hurt! —In
what have I deserved the distance you keep me at? — 
I knew not what to say. 
She struggled to disengage herself—Pray, Mr.
Lovelace, let me withdraw. I know not why this
is. I know not what I have done to offend you. I
see you are come with a design to quarrel with me. If
you wold not terrify me by the ill-humour you are
in, permit me to withdraw. I will hear all you have
to say another time—To-morrow morning, as I sent
you word—But indeed you frighten me. I beseech
you, if you have any value for me, permit me to
withdraw. 
Night, mid-night, is necessary, Belford. Surprize,
Terror, must be necessary to the ultimate Trial of this
charming creature, say the women below what they
will. I could not hold my purposes. This was not
the first time that I had intended to try if she could
forgive. 
I kissed her hand with a fervor, as if I would have 

left my lips upon it. —Withdraw then, dearest and
ever-dear creature. Indeed I entered in a very ill humour. 
I cannot bear the distance at which you so
causlesly keep me. Withdraw, Madam, since it is
your will to withdraw; and judge me generously; 
judge me but as I deserve to be judged; and let me
hope to meet you to-morrow morning early, in such
a temper as becomes our present situation, and my
future hopes. 
And so saying, I conducted her to the door, and
left her there. But instead of going down to the
women, I went into my own chamber, and locked
myself in; ashamed of being awed by her majestic
loveliness, and apprehensive virtue, into so great a
change of purpose, notwithstanding I had such just
provocations from the Letters of her saucy Friend,
founded on her own representations of facts and situations
between herself and me. 
The Lady (dating Sunday night) thus describes her
terrors, and Mr. Lovelace's behaviour, on the
occasion: 
On my entering the dining-room, he took my
hands in his, in such a humour, as I saw plainly he
was resolved to quarrel with me—And for what? — 
What had I done to him? —I never in my life beheld
in any-body such wild, such angry, such impatient
airs. I was terrified; and instead of being as angry
as I intended to be, I was forced to be all mildness. 
I can hardly remember what were his first words, I
was so frighted. But, You hate me, Madam! You
hate me, Madam! were some of them—with such a
fierceness—I wished myself a thousand miles distant
from him. I hate no-body, said I; I thank God I
hate no-body—You terrify me, Mr. Lovelace—Let
me leave you. —The man, my dear, looked quite
ugly—I never saw a man look so ugly as passion made
him look—And for what? —And he so grasped my 

hands! —Fierce creature! —He so grasped my hands! 
In short, he seemed by his looks, and by his words
(once putting his arms about me) to wish me to provoke
him. So that I had nothing to do but to beg
of him (which I did repeatedly) to permit me to withdraw; 
and to promise to meet him at his own time
in the morning. 
It was with a very ill grace that he complied, on
that condition; and at parting he kissed my hand
with such a savageness, that a redness remains upon
it still. 
&dotup;Do you not think, my dear, that I have reason
to be incensed at him, my situation considered? 
Am I not under a necessity, as it were, of quarrelling
with him; at least every other time I see him? 
No Prudery, no Coquetry, no Tyranny in my
heart, or in my behaviour to him, that I know of. 
No affected Procrastination. Aiming at nothing
but decorum. He as much concerned, and so he
ought to think, as I, to have That observed. Too
much in his power: Cast upon him by the cruelty
of my relations. No other protection to fly to but
his. One plain path before us; yet such embarrasses,
such difficulties, such subjects for doubt,
for cavil, for uneasiness; as fast as one is obviated,
another to be introduced, and not by myself—I
know not how introduced—What pleasure can I
propose to myself in meeting such a wretch?&dotup; 
Perfect for me, my dearest Miss Howe, perfect
for me, I beseech you, your kind scheme with Mrs.
Townsend; and I will then leave this man. 
&dotup;My temper, I believe, is changed. No wonder
if it be. I question whether ever it will be what it
was. But I cannot make him half so uneasy by the
change, as I am myself.&dotup; See you not how, from
step to step, he grows upon me? —I tremble to look
back upon his encroachments. And now to give me
cause to apprehend more evil from him, than indignation 

will permit me to express! –––O my dear, perfect
your scheme, and let me fly from so strange a
wretch! 
&dotup;Yet, to be first an eloper from my friends to
him, as the world supposes; and now to be so from
him [To whom I know not!] how hard to one
who ever endeavoured to shun intricate paths!&dotup; 
But he must certainly have views in quarrelling with
me thus, which he dare not own! —Yet what can
they be? —I am terrified but to think of what they
may be! 
&dotup;Let me but get from him! —As to my reputation,
if I leave him—That is already too much wounded
for me, now, to be careful about any-thing, but
how to act so, as that my own Heart shall not reproach
me. As to the world's censure, I must be
content to suffer that—An unhappy composition,
however. —What a wreck have my fortunes suffered,
to be obliged to throw overboard so many
valuables, to preserve, indeed, the only valuable! — 
A composition that once it would have half-broken
my heart to think there would have been the least
danger that I should be obliged to submit to. 
&dotup;You, my dear, could not be a stranger to my
most secret failings, altho' you would not tell me
of them. What a pride did I take in the applause
of every one! —What a pride even in supposing I
had not that pride! —Which concealed itself from
my unexamining heart under the specious veil of
Humility, doubling the merit to myself by the supposed,
and indeed imputed, gracefulness in the manner
of conferring benefits, when I had not a single
merit in what I did, vastly overpaid by the pleasure
of doing some little good, and impelled, as I
may say, by talents given me—For what! —Not to
be proud of. 
&dotup;So desirous, in short, to be considered as an
Example! A vanity which my partial admirers 

put into my head! —And so secure in my own
virtue! 
&dotup;I am punished enough, enough mortified, for
this my vanity—I hope, enough, if it so please the
all-gracious Inflicter: Since now, I verily think, I
more despise myself for my presumptuous self-security,
as well as vanity, than ever I secretly
vaunted myself on my good inclinations: Secretly,
I say, however; for indeed I had not given myself
leisure to reflect, till I was thus mortified, how
very imperfect I was; nor how much truth there
is in what Divines tell us, That we sin in our best
performances. 
&dotup;But I was very young—But here let me watch
over myself again: For in those four words, I
was very young, is there not a palliation couched,
that were enough to take all efficacy from the discovery
and confession? 
&dotup;What strange imperfect beings! —But Self here,
which is at the bottom of all we do, and of all we
wish, is the grand misleader. 
&dotup;I will not apologize to you, my dear, for these
grave reflections. Is it not enough to make the
unhappy creature look into herself, and endeavour
to detect herself, who, from such an high Reputation,
left to proud and presumptuous Self, should,
by one thoughtless step, be brought to the dreadful
situation I am in? 
&dotup;Let me, however, look forward: To despond
would be to add sin to sin. And whom have I to
raise me up, whom to comfort me, if I desert myself? 
—Thou, O Father! who, I hope, hast not
yet deserted, hast not yet cursed me! —For I am
thine! —It is fit that meditation should supply the
rest.–––&dotup; 
* *
I was so disgusted with him, as well as frighted
by him, that, on my return to my chamber, in a fit 

of passionate despair, I tore almost in two, the Answer
I had written to his proposals. 
I will see him in the morning, because I promised
I would. But I will go out, and that without him,
or any attendant. If he account not tolerably for
his sudden change of behaviour, and a proper opportunity
offer of a private lodging in some creditable
house, I will not any more return to this: –––At present
I think so. –––And there will I either attend the
perfecting of your scheme; or, by your epistolary
mediation, make my own terms with the wretch; 
since it is your opinion, that I must be his, and cannot
help myself: Or, perhaps, take a resolution to
throw myself at once into Lady Betty's protection; 
and this will hinder him from making his insolently-threatened
visit to Harlowe-Place. 
The Lady writes again on Monday evening; and
gives her friend an account of all that passed between
herself and Mr. Lovelace that day; and
of her being terrified out of her purpose of going
out: But Mr. Lovelace's next Letters giving a
more ample account of all, hers are omitted. 
It is proper, however, to mention, that she re-urges
Miss Howe (from the dissatisfaction she has reason
for from what passed between Mr. Lovelace
and herself) to perfect her scheme in relation to
Mrs. Townsend. She concludes this Letter in these
words: 
I should say something of your last favour (but a
few hours ago received) and of your dialogue with
your Mother–––Are you not very whimsical, my dear? 
I have but two things to wish for on this occasion. — 
The one, that your charming pleasantry had a better
subject than that you find for it in this dialogue––– 
The other, that my situation were not such, as must
too often damp that pleasantry in you, and will not 

permit me to enjoy it, as I used to do. Be, however,
happy in yourself, tho' you cannot in 
Your Clarissa Harlowe.
