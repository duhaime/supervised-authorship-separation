This Day, as Matters could not be ready
for our Appearance at a better Place, we
staid at home; and my dear Master imploy'd 

himself a good deal in his Library. And I have
been taken up pretty much, I hope, as I ought
to be, in Thankfulness, Prayer and Meditation,
in my newly presented Closet: And I hope
God will be pleased to give a Blessing to me; 
for I have the Pleasure to think I am not puff'd
up with this great Alteration, and yet am not
wanting to look upon all these Favours and
Blessings in the Light wherein I ought to receive
them, both at the Hands of Heaven, and
my dear Benefactor. 
We dined together with great Pleasure, and
I had, in every Word and Action, all the Instances
of Kindness and Affection, that the most
indulg'd Heart could wish. My Master said, He
would return to his Closet again; and at Five
o'Clock would come and take a Walk with me
in the Garden; and so retired as soon as he
had dined, and I went up to mine. 
About Six he was pleased to come up to
me, and said, Now, my Dear, I will attend you
for a little Walk in the Garden; and I gave him
my Hand with great Pleasure. 
This Garden is much better cultivated than
the Lincolnshire one; but that is larger; and
has nobler Walks in it; and yet there is a
pretty Canal in this, and a Fountain, and Cascade. 
We had a deal of sweet Conversation as
we walk'd; and, after we had taken a Turn
round, I bent towards the little Garden; and
when I came near the Summer-house, took the
Opportunity to slip from him, and just whipt
up the Steps of this once frightful Place, and
kneeled down, and said, I bless thee, O God, 

for my Escapes, and for thy Mercies! O let me
always possess a grateful humble Heart! And I
whipt down again, and join'd him; and he
hardly miss'd me. 
Several of the neighbouring Gentry sent
their Compliments to him on his Return, but
not a Word about his Marriage; particularly
'Squire Arthur, Lady Towers, 'Squire Brooks,
and 'Squire Martin of the Grove.
