Miss Clarissa Harlowe, To Miss Howe. 

Wednesday, March 1. 
You both nettled and alarmed me, my dearest
Miss Howe, by the concluding part of your last. 
At first reading it, I did not think it necessary, said I
to myself, to guard against a critic, when I was writing
to so dear a friend. But then recollecting myself,
Is there not more in it, said I, than the result of a
vein so naturally lively? Surely, I must have been
guilty of an inadvertence. —Let me enter into the
close examination of myself, which my beloved friend
advises. 
I did so; and cannot own any of the glow, any of
the throbs you mention. —Upon my word, I will repeat,
I cannot. And yet the passages in my letter
upon which you are so humourously severe, lay me
fairly open to your agreeable raillery. I own they do. 
And I cannot tell what turn my mind had taken, to
dictate so oddly to my pen. 
But-pray-now—Is it saying so much, when one,
who has no very particular regard to any man, says,
There are some who are preferable to others? And is
it blameable to say, Those are the preferable, who are
not well used by one's relations; yet dispense with
that usage out of regard to one's self, which they would
otherwise resent? Mr. Lovelace, for instance, I may
be allow'd to say, is a man to be preferr'd to Mr.
Solmes; and that I do prefer him to that man: But,
surely, this may be said, without its being a necessary
consequence, that one must be in love with him. 
Indeed, I would not be in love with him, as it is
called, for the world: First, because I have no opinion
of his morals; and think it a fault in which our
whole family, my brother excepted, has had a share, 

that he was permitted to visit us with a hope; which,
however being distant, did not, as I have observed
heretofore, intitle any of us to call him to account for
such of his immoralities as came to our ears. Next,
because I think him to be a vain man, capable of triumphing,
secretly at least, over a person whose heart
he thinks he has engaged. And, thirdly, because the
assiduities and veneration which you impute to him,
seem to carry an haughtiness in them, as if his address
had a merit in it, that would be an equivalent for a
lady's favour. In short, he seems to me so to behave,
when most unguarded, as if he thought himself above
the very politeness which his birth and education (perhaps
therefore more than his choice) oblige him to shew. 
In other words, his very politeness appears to me to
be constrained; and, with the most remarkably easy
and genteel person, something seems to be behind in
his manner, that is too studiously kept in. Then, goodhumour'd
as he is thought to be in the main to other
peoples servants, and this even to familiarity (altho',
as you have observ'd, a familiarity that has dignity in it,
not unbecoming a man of quality), he is apt sometimes
to break out into passion with his own: An oath or a
curse follows; and such looks from those servants as
plainly shew terror; and that they should have far'd
worse, had they not been in my hearing: With a confirmation
in the master's looks of a surmize too well
justify'd. 
Indeed, my dear, THIS man is not THE man. I
have great objections to him. My heart throbs not
after him: I glow not, but with indignation against
myself, for having given room for such an imputation. — 
But you must not, my dearest friend, construe common
Gratitude into Love. I cannot bear that you should. 
But if ever I should have the misfortune to think it
Love, I promise you, upon my word, which is the same
as upon my honour, that I will acquaint you with it. 

You bid me to tell you very speedily, and by the
new-found expedient, that I am not displeased with
you for your agreeable raillery: I dispatch this therefore
immediately; postponing to my next the account
of the inducements which my friends have to promote
with so much earnestness the address of Mr. Solmes. 
Be satisfy'd, my dear, mean time, that I am not
displeased with you: Indeed I am not: On the contrary,
I give you my hearty thanks for your friendly
premonitions. And I charge you, as I have often
done, that if you observe any thing in me so very
faulty, as would require, from you to others, in
my behalf, the palliation of friendly and partial love,
you acquaint me with it: For, methinks, I would
to conduct myself, as not to give reason even for an
adversary to censure me: And how shall so weak and
so young a creature avoid the censure of such, if my
friend will not hold a looking-glass before me, to let
me see my imperfections? 
Judge me then, my dear, as any indifferent person
knowing what you know of me) would do: —I may,
at first, be a little pained; may glow a little, perhaps,
to be found less worthy of your friendship, than I wish
to be; but assure yourself, that your kind correction
will give me reflection, that shall amend me. If it
do not, you will have a fault to accuse me of, that
will be utterly in-excusable: A fault, let me add,
that should you not accuse me of it, if in your opinion
I am guilty, you will not be so much, so warmly,
my friend, as I am yours; who have never spar'd
you, you know, my dear, on the like occasions. 
Here I break off; to begin another letter to you; 
with the assurance, mean time, that I am, and ever
will be, 
Your equally affectionate
and grateful
Cl. Harlowe.
