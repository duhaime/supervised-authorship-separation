Mr. Belford, To Robert Lovelace, Esq; 

Tuesday Morn. (July 18.) 6 o'Clock. 
Having sat up late to finish and seal in readiness
my Letter to the above period, I am disturbed
before I wished to have risen, by the arrival of thy
second fellow, man and horse in a foam. 
While he baits, I will write a few lines, most heartily
to congratulate thee on thy expected rage and impatience,
and on thy recovery of mental feeling. 
How much does the idea thou givest me of thy
deserved torments, by thy upright awls, bodkins,
pins, and packing-needles, by thy rolling hogshead
with iron spikes, and by thy macerated sides, delight
me! 
I will, upon every occasion that offers, drive more
spikes into thy hogshead, and roll thee down-hill, and
up, as thou recoverest to sense, or rather returnest back
to senselesness. Thou knowest therefore the terms on
which thou art to enjoy my correspondence. Am not
I, who have all along, and in time, protested against
thy barbarous and ungrateful perfidies to a woman so
noble, entitled to drive remorse, if possible, into thy
hitherto callous heart? 
Only let me repeat one thing, which perhaps I
mentioned too slightly before, That the Lady was
determined to remove to new lodgings, where neither
you nor I should be able to find her, had I not solemnly
assured her, that she might depend upon being
free from your visits. 
These assurances I thought I might give her, not 

only because of your promise, but because it is necessary
for you to know where she is, in order to address
yourself to her by your friends. 
Enable me therefore to make good to her this my
solemn engagement; or adieu to all friendship, at least
to all correspondence, with thee for ever. 
J. Belford.
