MRS. GWYLLIM,
WHEN this cums to hand, be sure to pack up
in the trunk male that stands in my closet, to be
sent me in the Bristol waggon without loss of time
the following articles, viz. my rose collard neglejay,
with green robins, my yellow damask, and my
black velvet suit, with the short hoop; my bloo
quilted petticot, my green manteel, my laced apron,
my French commode, Macklin head and lappets,
and the litel box with my jowls. Williams may
bring over my bum-daffee, and the viol with the
easings of Dr. Hill's dock-water, and Chowder's
lacksitif. The poor creature has been terribly constuprated
ever since we left huom. Pray take particular
care of the house while the family is absent. Let
there be a fire constantly kept in my brother's
chamber and mine. The maids, having nothing
to do, may be sat a spinning. I desire you'll clap
a pad-luck on the wind-seller, and let none of the
men have excess to the strong bear—don't forget to
have the gate shit every evening before dark. — 
The gardnir and the hind may lie below in the
landry, to partake the house, with the blunderbuss
and the great dog; and I hope you'll have a watchfull
eye over the maids. I know that hussy, Mary
Jones, loves to be rumping with the men. Let
me know if Alderney's calf be should yet, and what
he fought—if the ould goose be sitting; and if the
cobler has cut Dicky, and how the pore anemil
bore the operation. —No more at present, but rests, 
Yours,
Tabitha Bramble.
