Mr. Williams has been here; but we have
had no Opportunity to talk together: He
seem'd confounded at Mrs. Jewkes's Change of
Temper, and Reservedness, after her kind Visit,
and their Freedom with one another, and much
more at what I am going to tell you. He ask'd,
if I would take a Turn in the Garden with
Mrs. Jewkes and him. No, said she, I can't
go. Said he, May not Mrs. Pamela take a
Walk? â€”No, said she, I desire she won't. 
Why, Mrs. Jewkes? said he: I am afraid I
have some-how disobliged you. Not at all,
reply'd she; but I suppose you will soon be at
Liberty to walk together as much as you
please: And I have sent a Messenger for my
last Instructions, about this and more weighty
Matters; and when they come, I shall leave you
to do as you both will; but till then, it is no
matter how little you are together. This
alarm'd us both; and he seem'd quite struck of
a Heap, and put on, as I thought, a self-accusing
Countenance. So I went behind her Back, and
held my two Hands together, flat, with a Bit of
Paper I had, between them, and looked at
him; and he seemed to take me, as I intended,
intimating the renewing of the Correspondence
by the Tiles. 
I left them both together, and retired to
my Closet, to write a Letter for the Tiles; but
having no Time for a Copy, I will give you
the Substance only. 

I expostulated with him on his too
great Openness and Easiness to fall into Mrs.
Jewkes's Snares; told him my Apprehensions
of foul Play; and gave briefly the Reasons
which mov'd me: Begg'd to know what he
had said; and intimated, that I thought there
was the highest Reason to resume our Project
of the Escape by the Back-door. I put this in
the usual Place, in the Evening, and now wait
with Impatience for an Answer.
