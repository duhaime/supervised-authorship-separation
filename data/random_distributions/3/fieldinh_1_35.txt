A Dialogue matrimonial, which
passed between Jonathan Wild,
Esquire, and Lætitia his Wife,
on the Morning of the Day Fortnight
on which his Nuptials were
celebrated; which concluded more
amicably than those Debates generally
do. 
Jonathan.
My Dear, I wish you would lie a little
longer in Bed this Morning. 
Lætitia.
Indeed I cannot: I am engaged to breakfast
with Sir John. 
Jonathan.
I don't know what Sir John doth so
often at my House. I assure you I am uneasy 

at it; for though I have no Suspicion
of your Virtue, yet it may injure your Reputation
in the Opinion of my Neighbours. 
Lætitia.
I don't trouble my Head about my
Neighbours; and they shall no more tell
me what Company I am to keep than my
Husband shall. 
Jonathan.
A good Wife would keep no Company
which made her Husband uneasy. 
Lætitia.
You might have found one of those good
Wives, Sir, if you had pleased, I had no
Objection to it. 
Jonathan.
I thought I had found one in you. 
Lætitia.
You did! I am very much obliged to
you for thinking me so poor-spirited a
Creature; but I hope to convince you to 

the contrary. What, I suppose you took
me for a raw, senseless Girl, who knew
nothing what other married Women do! 
Jonathan.
No Matter what I took you for: I have
taken you for better and worse. 
Lætitia.
And at your own Desire too? For, I am
sure, you never had mine. I should not
have broken my Heart if Mr. Wild had
thought proper to bestow himself on any
other more happy Woman. ––––Ha, ha. 
Jonathan.
I hope, Madam, you don't imagine that
was not in my Power, or that I married you
out of any kind of Necessity. 
Lætitia.
O no, Sir, I am convinced there are silly
Women enough. And far be it from me
to accuse you of any Necessity for a Wife,
I believe you could have very well been
contented with the State of a Batchelor; 

but that, you know, a Woman cannot tell
beforehand. 
Jonathan.
I can't guess what you would insinuate; 
for I believe no Woman had ever less Reason
to complain of her Husband's Want of
Fondness. 
Lætitia.
Then some, I am certain, have great
Reason to complain of the Price they give
for them. —But I know better things. 
(These Words to be spoken with a very great
Air, and Toss of the Head.) 
Jonathan.
Well, my Sweeting, I will make it impossible
for you to wish me more fond.— 
Lætitia.
Pray, Mr. Wild, none of this nauseous
Behaviour, nor those odious Words. —I
wish you were fond! —I assure you— 
I don't know what you would pretend to
insinuate of me. —I have no Wishes
which misbecome a virtuous Woman— 

No, nor should not, if I had married
for Love. —And especially now when
no body, I am sure, can suspect me of any
such thing.— 
Jonathan.
If you did not marry for Love, why
did you marry? 
Lætitia.
Because it was convenient, and my
Parents forced me. 
Jonathan.
I hope, Madam, at least, you will not
tell me to my Face, you have made your
Convenience of me. 
Lætitia.
I have made nothing of you; nor do I
desire the Honour of making any thing of
you. 
Jonathan.
Yes, you have made a Husband of
me. 

Lætitia.
No, you made your self so; for I repeat
once more, It was not my Desire but
your own. 
Jonathan.
You should think yourself obliged to
me for that Desire. 
Lætitia.
La! Sir, you was not so singular in it. 
I was not in Despair. —I have had other
Offers, and better too. 
Jonathan.
I wish you had accepted them with all
my Heart. 
Lætitia.
I must tell you, Mr. Wild, this is a very
brutish Manner of treating a Woman, to
whom you have such Obligations; but I
know how to despise it, and to despise you
too for shewing it me. Indeed I am well
enough paid for the foolish Preference I
gave to you. I flattered myself that I 

should at least have been used with good
Manners. I thought I had married a Gentleman; 
but I find you every way contemptible,
and below my Concern. 
Jonathan.
D&wblank;n you, Madam, have not I more
Reason to complain, when you tell me you
married me for your Convenience only? 
Lætitia.
Very fine, truly. Is it Behaviour worthy
a Man to swear at a Woman? Yet
why should I mention what comes from a
Wretch whom I despise. 
Jonathan.
Don't repeat that Word so often. I
despise you as heartily as you can me. And,
to tell you a Truth, I married you for my
Convenience likewise, to satisfy a Passion
which I have now satisfied, and you may
be d&wblank;d for any thing I care. 
Lætitia.
The World shall know how barbarously
I am treated by such a Villain. 

Jonathan.
I need take very little Pains to acquaint
the World what a B&wblank;ch you are, your
Actions will demonstrate it. 
Lætitia.
Monster, I would advise you not to
depend too much on my Sex, and provoke
me too far; for I can do you a Mischief,
and will, if you dare use me so, you Villain! 
Jonathan.
Begin whenever you please, Madam; 
but, assure yourself, the Moment you lay
aside the Woman, I will treat you as such
no longer; and if the first Blow is yours, I
promise you the last shall be mine. 
Lætitia.
Use me as you will; but d&wblank;n me if
ever you shall use me as a Woman again; 
for, may I be cursed, if ever I enter your
Bed more. 

Jonathan.
May I be cursed if that Abstinence be
not the greatest Obligation you can lay
upon me; for, I assure you faithfully, your
Person was all I had ever any Regard for; 
and that I now loath and detest, as much
as ever I liked it. 
Lætitia.
It is impossible for two People to agree
better; for I always detested your Person; 
and, as for any other Regard, you must be
convinced I never could have any for you. 
Jonathan.
Why, then, since we are come to a
right Understanding, as we are to live together,
suppose we agreed, instead of quarrelling
and abusing, to be civil to each other. 
Lætitia.
With all my Heart. 
Jonathan.
Let us shake Hands then, and henceforwards 

never live like Man and Wife; that
is, never be loving, nor never quarrel. 
Lætitia.
Agreed.—But pray, Mr. Wild, why
B&wblank;ch? Why did you suffer such a
Word to escape you? 
Jonathan.
It is not worth your Remembrance. 
Lætitia.
You agree I shall converse with whomsoever
I please? 
Jonathan.
Without Controul. And I have the
same Liberty? 
Lætitia.
When I interfere, may every Curse you
can wish attend me. 
Jonathan.
Let us now take a Farewel-Kiss; and
may I be hang'd if it is not the sweetest
you ever gave me. 

Lætitia.
But why, B&wblank;ch? —Methinks I
should be glad to know why B&wblank;ch? 
At which Words he sprang from the
Bed, d&wblank;ing her Temper heartily. She
returned it again with equal Abuse, which
was continued on both Sides while he was
dressing. However, they agreed to continue
stedfast in this new Resolution; and
the Joy arising on that Occasion at length
dismissed them pretty amicably from each
other, though Lætitia could not help concluding
with the Words, Why B&wblank;ch?
