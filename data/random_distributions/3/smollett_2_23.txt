SO then Mrs. Blackerby's affair has proved a
false alarm, and I have saved my money? I wish,
however, her declaration had not been so premature,
for though my being thought capable of making
her a mother, might have given me some credit,
the reputation of an intrigue with such a
cracked pitcher does me no honour at all—In my
last I told you I had hopes of seeing Quin, in his
hours of elevation, at the tavern, which is the temple
of mirth and good-fellowship; where he, as Priest
of Comus, utters the inspirations of wit and humour
—I have had that satisfaction. I have dined
with his club at the Three Tuns, and had the 

honour to sit him out. At half an hour past eight
in the evening, he was carried home with six good
bottles of claret under his belt; and it being then
Friday, he gave orders that he should not be disturbed
till Sunday at noon—You must not imagine
that this dose had any other effect upon his
conversation, but that of making it more extravagantly
entertaining—He had lost the use of his
limbs, indeed, several hours before we parted, but
he retained all his other faculties in perfection; and
as he gave vent to every whimsical idea as it rose, I
was really astonished at the brilliancy of his thoughts,
and the force of his expression. Quin is a real voluptuary
in the articles of eating and drinking; and
so confirmed an epicure, in the common acceptation
of the term, that he cannot put up with ordinary
fare. This is a point of such importance with him,
that he always takes upon himself the charge of catering; 
and a man admitted to his mess, is always
sure of eating delicate victuals, and drinking excellent
wine—He owns himself addicted to the delights
of the stomach, and often jokes upon his own
sensuality; but there is nothing selfish in this appetite
—He finds that good chear unites good company; 
exhilerates the spirits, opens the heart, banishes
all restraint from conversation, and promotes
the happiest purposes of social life. —But Mr. James
Quin is not a subject to be discussed in the compass
of one letter; I shall therefore, at present, leave him
to his repose, and call another of a very different
complexion. 
You desire to have further acquaintance with
the person of our aunt, and promise yourself much
entertainment from her connexion with Sir Ulic
Mackilligut: but in this hope you are baulked
already; that connexion is dissolved. The Irish
baronet is an old hound, that finding her carrion,
has quitted the scent—I have already told you, that 

Mrs. Tabitha Bramble is a maiden of forty-five. 
In her person, she is tall, raw-boned, aukward,
flat-chested, and stooping; her complexion is sallow
and freckled; her eyes are not grey, but
greenish, like those of a cat, and generally inflamed; 
her hair is of a sandy, or rather dusty hue; 
her forehead low; her nose long, sharp, and, towards
the extremity, always red in cool weather; 
her lips skinny, her mouth extensive, her teeth
straggling and loose, of various colours and conformation; 
and her long neck shrivelled into a thousand
wrinkles—In her temper, she is proud, stiff,
vain, imperious, prying, malicious, greedy, and
uncharitable. In all likelihood, her natural austerity
has been soured by disappointment in love; 
for her long celibacy is by no means owing to her
dislike of matrimony: on the contrary, she has
left no stone unturned to avoid the reproachful
epithet of old maid. 
Before I was born, she had gone such lengths in
the way of flirting with a recruiting officer, that
her reputation was a little singed. She afterwards
made advances to the curate of the parish, who
dropped some distant hints about the next presentation
to the living, which was in her brother's gift; 
but finding that was already promised to another,
he flew off at a tangent; and Mrs. Tabby, in revenge,
found means to deprive him of his cure. 
Her next lover was lieutenant of a man of war, a
relation of the family, who did not understand the
refinements of the passion, and expressed no aversion
to grapple with cousin Tabby in the way of
marriage; but before matters could be properly
adjusted, he went out on a cruise, and was killed in
an engagement with a French frigate. Our aunt,
though baffled so often, did not yet despair—She
layed all her-snares for Dr. Lewis, who is the fidus
Achates of my uncle. She even fell sick upon 

the occasion, and prevailed with Matt to interpose
in her behalf with his friend; but the Doctor
being a shy cock, would not be caught with chaff,
and flatly rejected the proposal: so that Mrs. Tabitha
was content to exert her patience once more,
after having endeavoured in vain to effect a rupture
betwixt the two friends; and now she thinks proper
to be very civil to Lewis, who is become necessary
to her in the way of his profession. 
These, however, are not the only efforts she has
made towards a nearer conjunction with our sex. 
Her fortune was originally no more than a thousand
pounds; but she gained an accession of five hundred
by the death of a sister, and the lieutenant left her
three hundred in his will. These sums she has
more than doubled, by living free of all expence,
in her brother's house; and dealing in cheese and
Welsh flannel, the produce of his flocks and dairy. 
At present her capital is increased to about four
thousand pounds; and her avarice seems to grow
every day more and more rapacious; but even this is
not so intolerable, as the perverseness of her nature,
which keeps the whole family in disquiet and uproar. 
She is one of those geniuses who find some
diabolical enjoyment in being dreaded and detested
by their fellow-creatures. 
I once told my uncle, I was surprised that a man
of his disposition could bear such a domestic plague,
when it could be so easily removed—The remark
made him sore, because it seemed to tax him with
want of resolution—Wrinkling up his nose, and
drawing down his eye-brows, “A young fellow,
(said he) when he first thrusts his snout into the
world, is apt to be surprised at many things,
which a man of experience knows to be ordinary
and unavoidable—This precious aunt of yours is
become insensibly a part of my constitution— 
Damn her! She's a noli me tangere in my flesh, 

which I cannot bear to be touched or tampered
with.” I made no reply; but shifted the conversation. 
He really has an affection for this original,
which maintains its ground in defiance of common
sense, and in despite of that contempt which
he must certainly fell for her character and understanding,
Nay, I am convinced, that she has likewise
a most virulent attachment to his person; 
though her love never shews itself but in the shape
of discontent; and she persists in tormenting him
out of sheer tenderness—The only object within
doors upon which she bestows any marks of affection,
in the usual stile, is her dog Chowder; a filthy
our from Newfoundland, which she had in a present
from the wife of a skipper in Swansey—One
would imagine she had distinguished this beast with
her favour on account of his ugliness and ill-nature; 
if it was not, indeed, an instinctive sympathy between
his disposition and her own. Certain it is,
she caresses him without ceasing; and even harrasses
the family in the service of this cursed animal,
which, indeed, has proved the proximate cause of
her breach with Sir Ulic Mackilligut. 
You must know, she yesterday wanted to steal
a march of poor Liddy, and went to breakfast in
the Room without any other companion than her
dog, in expectation of meeting with the Baronet,
who had agreed to dance with her in the evening— 
Chowder no sooner made his appearance in the Room
than the master of the Ceremonies, incensed at his
presumption, ran up to drive him away, and threatened
him with his foot; but the other seemed to
despise his authority, and displaying a formidable
case of long, white, sharp teeth, kept the puny
monarch at bay—while he stood under some trepidation,
fronting his antagonist, and bawling to the
waiter, Sir Ulic Mackilligut came to his assistance; 
and seeming ignorant of the connexion between this 

intruder and his mistress gave the former such a
kick in the jaws, as sent him howling to the door— 
Mrs. Tabitha incensed at this outrage, ran after
him, squalling in a tone equally disagreeable; 
while the Baronet followed her on one side, making
apologies for his mistake; and Derrick on the
other, making remonstrances upon the rules and
regulations of the place. 
Far from being satisfied with the Knight's excuses,
she said she was sure he was no gentleman; 
and when the Master of the Ceremonies offered to
hand her into the chair, she rapped him over the
knuckles with her fan. My uncle's footman being
still at the door, she and Chowder got into the
same vehicle, and were carried off amidst the jokes
of the chairmen and other populace—I had been
riding out on Clerkendown, and happened to enter
just as the fracas was over—The Baronet, coming
up to me with an affected air of chagrin recounted
the adventure; at which I laughed heartily, and
then his countenance cleared up. “My dear soul,
(said he) when I saw a sort of a wild baist,
snarling with open mouth at the Master of the
Ceremonies, like the red cow going to devour
Tom Thumb, I could do no less than go to
the assistance of the little man; but I never
dreamt the baist was one of Mrs. Bramble's
attendants—O! if I had, he might have made
his breakfast upon Derrick and welcome—But,
you know, my dear friend, how natural it is
for us Irishmen to blunder, and to take the
wrong sow by the ear—However I will confess
judgment, and cry her mercy; and 'tis to be
hoped, a penitent sinner may be forgiven.” I
told him, that as the offence was not involuntary
of his side, it was to be hoped he would not find
her implacable. 

But in truth, all this concern was dissembled. 
In his approaches of gallantry to Mrs. Tabitha,
he had been misled by a mistake of at least six thousand
pounds, in the calculation of her fortune; and
in this particular he was just undeceived. He,
therefore, seized the first opportunity of incurring
her displeasure decently, in such a manner as would
certainly annihilate the correspondence; and he
could not have taken a more effectual method, than
that of beating her dog. When he presented himself
at our door, to pay his respects to the offended
fair, he was refused admittance; and given to understand,
that he should never find her at home for
the future. She was not so inaccessible to Derrick,
who came to demand satisfaction for the insult she
had offered to him, even in the verge of his own
court. She knew it was convenient to be well with
the master of the Ceremonies, while she continued
to frequent the Rooms; and, having heard he was
a poet, began to be afraid of making her appearance
in a ballad or lampoon. —She therefore made
excuses for what she had done, imputing it to the
flutter of her spirits; and subscribed handsomely
for his poems: so that he was perfectly appeased,
and overwhelmed her with a profusion of compliment. 
He even solicited a reconciliation with
Chowder; which, however, the latter declined; 
and he declared, that if he could find a precedent
in the annals of the Bath, which he would carefully
examine for that purpose, her favourite should
be admitted to the next public breakfasting—But,
I believe she will not expose herself or him to the
risque of a second disgrace—Who will supply the
place of Mackilligut in her affections, I cannot
foresee; but nothing in the shape of man can come
amiss. Though she is a violent church-woman,
of the most intolerant zeal, I believe in my conscience
she would have no objection, at present, to 

treat on the score of matrimony with an Anabaptist,
Quaker, or Jew; and even ratify the treaty, at
the expence of her own conversion. But, perhaps,
I think too hardly of this kinswoman; who, I must
own, is very little beholden to the good opinion of 
Yours,
J. Melford.
