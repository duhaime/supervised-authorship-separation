Hannah Burton. In Answer. 

Monday, July 3. 
Honored Maddam,
I have not forgot to write, and never will forget
any-thing you, my dear young Lady, was so good
as to larn me. I am very sorrowfull for your misfortens,
my dearest young Lady; so sorrowfull, I do
not know what to do. Gladd at harte would I be to
be able to come to you. But indeed I have not been
able to stir out of my rome here at my Mother's, ever
since I was forsed to leave my plase with a Roomatise,
which has made me quite and clene helpless. I will
pray for you night and day, my dearest, my kindest,
my goodest young Lady, who have been so badly
used; and I am very sorry I cannot come to do you
love and service; which will ever be in the harte of
mee to do, if it was in my power: Who am 
Your most dewtifull Sarvant to command,
Hannah Burton.
