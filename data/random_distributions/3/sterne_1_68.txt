Tho' I hate salutations and
greetings in the market-place,
yet when we got into the middle of
this, I stopp'd to take my last look
and last farewel of Maria. 
Maria, tho' not tall, was nevertheless
of the first order of fine forms
—affliction had touch'd her looks
with something that was scarce earthly
—still she was feminine—and so much
was there about her of all that the 

heart wishes, or the eye looks for in
woman, that could the traces be
ever worn out of her brain, and those
of Eliza's out of mine, she should
not only eat of my bread and drink of my
own cup, but Maria should lay in
my bosom, and be unto me as a
daughter. 
Adieu, poor luckless maiden!—imbibe
the oil and wine which the compassion
of a stranger, as he journieth
on his way, now pours into thy
wounds—the being who has twice
bruised thee can only bind them up
for ever.
