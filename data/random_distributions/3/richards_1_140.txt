Miss Clarissa Harlowe. 
In Continuation. 

But this subject must not be pursued. Another
might, with more pleasure (tho' not with more
approbation) upon one of your lively excursions. It
is upon the high airs you give yourself upon the word
approve. 
How comes it about, I wonder, that a young Lady
so noted for a predominating generosity, should not
be uniformly generous? —That your generosity should
fail in an instance, where policy, prudence, gratitude,
would not permit it to fail? Mr. Hickman (as
you confess) has indeed a worthy mind. If I had not
long ago known that, he would never have found an
advocate in me for my Anna Howe's favour to him. 
Often and often have I been concerned, when I was
your happy guest, to see him, after a conversation in
which he had well supported his part in your absence,
sink at once into silence the moment you came into
company. 
I have told you of this before: And I believe I
hinted to you once, that the superciliousness you put
on only to him, was capable of a construction, which
at the time would have very little gratified your pride
to have had made; since it would have been as much
in his favour, as in your disfavour. 
Mr. Hickman, my dear, is a modest man. I never
see a modest man, but I am sure (if he has not wanted
opportunities) that he has a treasure in his mind, which 

requires nothing but the key of Encouragement to unlock
it, to make him shine—While a confident man,
who, to be confident, must think as meanly of his
company, as highly of himself, enters with magisterial
airs upon any subject; and, depending upon his assurance
to bring himself off when found out, talks of
more than he is master of. 
But a modest man! —O my dear, shall not a modest
woman distinguish and wish to consort with a modest
man? —A man, before whom, and to whom, she may
open her lips secure of his good opinion of all she says,
and of his just and polite regard for her judgment? and
who must therefore inspire her with an agreeable self-confidence. 
What a lot have I drawn! —We are all indeed apt
to turn teachers—But, surely, I am better enabled to
talk, to write, upon these subjects, than ever I was! — 
But I will banish myself, if possible, from an address
which, when I began to write, I was determined to
confine wholly to your own particular. 
My dearest, dearest friend, how ready are you to
tell us what others should do, and even what a Mother
should have done! But indeed you once, I remember,
advanced, that, as different attainments required different
talents to master them, so, in the writing way,
a person might not be a bad Critic upon the works
of others, altho' he might himself be unable to write
with excellence. But will you permit me to account
for all this readiness of finding fault, by placing it to
Human Nature, which, being sensible of the defects
of Human Nature (that is to say, of its own defects)
loves to be correcting? But in exercising that talent,
chuses rather to turn its eye outward than inward? 
In other words, to employ itself rather in the out-door
search, than in the in-door examination? 
And here give me leave to add (and yet it is with
tender reluctance) that altho' you say very pretty
things of notable wives; and altho' I join with you 

in opinion, that husbands may have as many inconveniencies
to encounter with, as conveniencies to boast
of, from women of that character; yet Lady Hartley
perhaps would have had milder treatment from your
pen, had it not been dipt in gall with a Mother in
your eye. 
&dotup;As to the Money you so generously and repeatedly
offer, don't be angry with me, if I again say,
that I am very desirous that you should be able to
averr, without the least qualifying or reserve, that
nothing of that sort has passed between us. I know
your Mother's strong way of putting the question
she is intent upon having answered. But yet I promise
that I will be obliged to nobody but you, when
I have occasion.&dotup;
