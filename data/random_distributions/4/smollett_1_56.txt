His Eclipse, and gradual Declination. 
Misfortunes seldom come single: upon
the back of this hue and cry, he unluckily
prescribed phlebotomy to a gentleman of
some rank, who chanced to expire during the
operation; and quarrelled with his landlord
the apothecary, who charged him with having
forgot the good offices he had done him in the
beginning of his career; and desired he would
provide himself with another lodging. 
All these mishaps treading upon the heels of
one another, had a very mortifying effect upon
his practice. At every tea-table, his name was
occasionally put to the torture, with that of the
vile creature whom he had seduced; though it
was generally taken for granted, by all those
female casuists, that she must have made the
first advances: for it could not be supposed,
that any man would take much trouble in laying
schemes for the ruin of a person, whose attractions
were so slender, especially considering
the ill state of her health, a circumstance that
seldom adds to a woman's beauty or good humour:
besides, she was always a pert minx, that
affected singularity, and a masculine manner
of speaking; and many of them had foreseen
that she would, some time or other, bring herself
into such a pr√¶munire. At all gossipings,
where the apothecary or his wife assisted, Fathom's
pride, ingratitude, and malpractice were
canvassed; in all clubs of married men, he
was mentioned with marks of abhorrence and
detestation; and every medical coffeehouse 

rung with his reproach. Instances of his ignorance
and presumption were quoted and
many particulars feigned for the purpose of defamation; 
so that our hero was exactly in the
situation of a horseman, who, in riding at full
speed for the plate, is thrown from the saddle
in the middle of the race, and left without sense
or motion upon the plain. His progress,
though rapid, had been so short, that he could
not be supposed to have laid up store against
such a day of trouble; and as he still cherished
hopes of surmounting those obstacles which
had so suddenly started up in his way, he would
not resign his equipage, nor retrench his expences; 
but appeared, as usual, in all public places,
with that serenity and confidence of feature
which he had never deposited; and maintained
his external pomp, upon the little he had
reserved in the days of his prosperity, and
the credit he had acquired by the punctuality
of former payments. Both these funds,
however, failed in a very little time; his
law-suit was a gulf that swallowed up all his ready
money; and the gleanings of his practice
were scarce sufficient to answer his pocket expences,
which now increased in proportion to
the decrease of business; for as he had more
idle time, and was less admitted into private families,
so he thought he had more occasion to
enlarge his acquaintance among his own sex,
who alone were able to support him in his disgrace
with the other. He accordingly listed
himself in several clubs, and endeavoured to
monopolize the venereal branch of trade; tho'
this was but an indifferent resource; for almost
all his patients of this class, were such as either 

could not, or would not properly recompence
the physician. 
For some time, he lingered in this situation,
without going upwards or downwards, floating
like a wisp of straw, at the turning of the tide,
until he could no longer amuse the person of
whom he had hired his coach horses, or postpone
the other demands, which multiplied upon
him every day. Then was his chariot overturning
with a hideous crash, and his face so much
wounded with the shivers of the glass, which
went to pieces in the fall, that he appeared in
the coffee house with half a dozen black patches
upon his countance, gave a most circumstantial
detail of the risque he had run, and declared,
that he did not believe he should ever hazard
himself again in any sort of wheel carriage. 
Soon after this accident, he took an opportunity
of telling his friends, in the same public
place, that he had turned away his footman, on
account of his drunkenness, and was resolved,
for the future, to keep none but maids in his service,
because the men servants are generally impudent,
lazy, debauched, or dishonest; and, after
all, neither so neat, handy, or agreeable, as the
other sex. In the rear of this resolution, he
shifted his lodgings into a private court, being
distracted with the din of carriages, that disturb
the inhabitants who live towards the open
street; and gave his acquaintance to understand,
that he had a medical work upon the anvil,
which he could not finish without being indulged
in silence and tranquillity. In effect,
he gradually put on the exteriors of an author:
his watch, with a horizontal movement
by Graham, which he had often mentioned,
and shewn as a very curious piece of workmanship, 

began, about this time, to be very
much out of order, and was committed to the
care of a mender, who was in no hurry to
restore it. His tye-wig degenerated into a major; 
he sometimes appeared without a sword,
and was even observed in public with a second
day's shirt: at last, his cloaths became rusty,
and when he walked about the streets, his
head turned round in a surprising manner, by
an involuntary motion in his neck, which he
had contracted by an habit of reconnoitering
the ground, that he might avoid all dangerous
or disagreeable encounters. 
Fathom, finding himself descending the hill
of fortune, with an acquired gravitation,
strove to catch at every twig, in order to stop
or retard his descent. He now regretted the
opportunities he had neglected, of marrying
one of several women of moderate fortune,
who had made advances to him, in the zenith
of his reputation; and endeavoured, by forcing
himself into a lower path of life than any
he had hitherto trod, to keep himself afloat,
with the portion of some tradesman's daughter,
whom he meant to espouse. While he
exerted himself in his pursuit, he happened,
in returning from a place about thirty miles
from London, to become acquainted, in the
stage coach, with a young woman, of a
very homely appearance, whom, from the
driver's information, he understood to be the
the niece of a country justice, and daughter of
a soap-boiler, who had lived and died in London,
and left her, in her infancy, sole heiress
of his effects, which amounted to four thousand
pounds. The uncle, who was her guardian,
had kept her sacred from the knowledge 

of the world, resolving to effect a match betwixt
her and his own son; and it was with
much difficulty he had consented to this journey,
which she had undertaken as a visit to
her own mother, who had married a second
husband in town. 
Fraught with these anecdotes, Fathom began
to put forth his gallantry and good humour,
and, in a word, was admitted by the
lady, to the privilege of an acquaintance, in
which capacity he visited her during the term
of her residence in London; and as there was
no time to be lost, declared his honourable
intention: he had such a manifest advantage,
in point of personal accomplishments, over
the young gentleman who was destined for her
husband, that she did not disdain his proposals,
and before she set out for the country, he
had made such progress in her heart, that the
day was actually fixed for their nuptials, on
which he faithfully promised to carry her off
in a coach and six. How to raise money for
this expedition, was all the difficulty that remained:
for, by this time, his finances were
utterly dried up, and his credit altogether exhausted. 
Upon a very pressing occasion, he
had formerly applied himself to a certain
wealthy quack, who had relieved his necessities
by lending him a small sum of money, in
return for having communicated to him a secret
medicine, which he affirmed to be the most
admirable specifick that ever was invented. 
The nostrum had been used, and luckily for
him, succeeded in the trial; so that the empyrick,
in the midst of his satisfaction, began to
reflect, that this same Fathom, who pretended
to be in possession of a great many remedies, 

equally efficacious, would certainly become a
formidable rival to him, in his business, should
he ever be able to extricate himself from his
present difficulties. 
In consequence of these suggestions, he resolved
to keep our adventurer's head under
water, by maintaining him in the most abject
dependance; accordingly he had, from time
to time, accommodated him with small trifles,
which barely served to support his existence,
and even for these had taken notes of hand,
that he might have a scourge over his head, in
case he should prove insolent or refractory. To
this benefactor, Fathom applied for a reinforcement
of twenty guineas, which he sollicited with
the more confidence, as that sum would certainly
enable him to repay all other obligations. 
The quack would advance the money upon no
other condition, than that of knowing the
scheme, which being explained, he complied
with Ferdinand's request; but, at the same
time, privately dispatched an express to the
young lady's uncle, with a full account of the
whole conspiracy; so that when the doctor
arrived at the inn, according to appointment,
he was received by his worship, in person,
who gave him to understand, that his niece
had changed her mind, and gone fifty miles
farther into the country to visit a relation. 
This was a grievous disappointment to Fathom,
who really believed his mistress had forsaken
him thro' mere levity and caprice, and
was not undeceived till several months after
her marriage with her cousin, when, at an accidental
meeting in London, she explained the
story of the secret intelligence, and excused 

her marriage, as the effect of rigorous usage
and compulsion. 
Had our hero been really enamoured of her
person, he might have, probably, accomplished
his wishes, notwithstanding the steps she
had taken: but this was not the case; his
passion was of a different nature, and the object
of it effectually without his reach. With
regard to his appetite for women, as it was an
infirmity of his constitution, which he could
not overcome, and as he was in no condition
to gratify it at a great expence, he had of late
chosen an house-keeper from the hundreds of
Drury, and, to avoid scandal, allowed her to
assume his name. As to the intimation which
had been sent to the country justice, he immediately
imputed it to the true author, whom
he marked for his vengeance accordingly; but,
in the mean time, suppressed his resentment,
because he, in some measure, depended upon
him for subsistence. On the other hand, the
quack, dreading the forwardness and plausibility
of our hero, which might, one time or
other, render him independent, put a stop to
those supplies, on pretence of finding them
inconvenient; but, out of his friendship and
good will to Fathom, undertook to procure
for him such letters of recommendation, as
would infallibly make his fortune in the West-Indies,
and even to fit him out in a genteel
manner for the voyage. Ferdinand preceived
his drift, and thanked him for his generous
offer, which he would not fail to consider with
all due deliberation: though he was determined
against the proposal, but obliged to temporize,
that he might not incur the displeasure
of this man, at whose mercy he lay. 

Mean while the prosecution against him, in
Doctors Commons, drew near a period, and
the lawyers were clamorous for money, without
which he foresaw he should lose the advantage
which his cause had lately acquired by
the death of his antagonist's chief evidence; 
he therefore, seeing every other channel shut
up, began to doubt, whether the risque of
being apprehended or slain in the character of
a highwayman, was not over-ballanced by the
prospect of being acquitted of a charge which
had ruined his reputation and fortune, and
actually entertained thoughts of taking the air
on Honslow Heath, when he was diverted from
this expedient by a very singular adventure.
