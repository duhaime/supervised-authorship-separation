Mr. Belford, To Robert Lovelace, Esq; 

Nine, Friday morn. 
I have no opportunity to write at length, having necessary
orders to give on the melancholy occasion. Joel,
who got to me by six in the morning, and whom I dispatched
instantly back with the letter I had ready from last
night, gives me but an indifferent account of the state of
your mind. I wonder not at it; but Time (and nothing 

else can) will make it easier to you: If (that is to say) you
have compounded with your conscience; else it may be
heavier every day than other.

Tourville tells me what a way you are in. I hope
you will not think of coming hither. The lady in her Will
desires you may not see her. Four copies are making of
it. It is a long one; for she gives her reasons for all she
wills. I will write to you more particularly as soon as
possibly I can. 
* *
Three letters are just brought by a servant in livery,
directed To Miss Clarissa Harlowe. I will send copies of
them to you. The contents are enough to make one mad. 
How would this poor lady have rejoiced to receive them
—And yet, if she had, she would not have been enabled
to say, as she nobly did (a) , That God would not let her
depend for comfort upon any but Himself—And, indeed, for
some days past, she had seemed to have got above all
worldly considerations—Her fervent love, even for her Miss
Howe, as she acknowleged, having given way to supremer
fervors (b) .
