A breach being made in the walls, our soldiers
give the assault, take the place without opposition
—our sailors at the same time
become masters of all the other strengths
near Bocca Chica, and take possession of the
harbour—the good consequence of this success
—we move nearer the town— 
find two forts deserted, and the channel
blocked up with sunk vessels; which however,
we find means to clear—land our
soldiers at La Quinta—repulse a body of
militia—attack the castle of St. Lazar,
and are forced to retreat with great loss
—the remains of our army are re-imbarked
—an effort of the admired to take
the Town—the æconomy of our expedition
described. 
Having cannonaded the fort, during the
space of four hours, we were all ordered to
slip our cables, and sheer off; but next day the
engagement was renewed, and continued from
the morning till the afternoon, when the enemy's
fire from Bocca Chica slackened, and towards
evening was quite silenced. —A breach being
made on the other side, by our land-battery,
large enough to admit a middle sized baboon, 

provided he could find means to climb up to it; our
general proposed to give the assault that very night,
and actually ordered a detachment on that duty: 
Providence stood our friend upon this occasion,
and put it into the hearts of the Spaniards to abandon
the fort, which might have been maintained by
resolute men, to the day of judgment against all
the force we could exert in the attack. —And while
our soldiers took possession of the enemy's ramparts,
without resistance, the same good luck attended
a body of sailors, who made themselves
masters of fort St. Joseph, the faschine batteries,
and one Spanish man of war; the other three
being burnt or sunk by the foe, that they might
not fall into our hands. —The taking of these
forts, in the strength of which the Spaniards
chiefly confided, made us masters of the outward
harbour, and occasioned great joy among us; as
we laid our accounts with finding little or no opposition
from the town: And indeed, if a few
great ships had sailed up immediately, before they
had recovered from the confusion and despair that
our unexpected success had produced among them,
it is not impossible that we might have finished
the affair to our satisfaction, without any more
blood-shed: but this our Heroes disdained, as a
barbarous insult over the enemy's distress; and
gave them all the respite they could desire, in
order to recollect themselves. —In the mean time,
Mackshane taking the advantage of this general
exultation, waited on our captain, and pleaded
his own cause so effectually, that he was re-established
in his good graces; and as for Crampley,
there was no more notice taken of his behaviour
towards me, during the action. —But of all the 

consequences of the victory, none was more
grateful than plenty of fresh water, after we had
languished five weeks on the allowance of a purser's
quart per diem for each man, in the Torrid
Zone, where the sun was vertical, and the expence
of bodily fluid so great, that a gallon of
liquor could scarce supply the waste of twenty-four
hours; especially, as our provision consisted
of putrid salt beef, to which the sailors gave the
name of Irish horse; salt pork of New England,
which though neither fish nor flesh, favoured of
both; bread from the same country, every biscuit
whereof, like a piece of clock work, moved by
its own internal impulse, occasioned by the myriads
of insects that dwelt within it; and butter
served out by the gill, that tasted like train-oil
thickened with salt. Instead of small-beer, each
man was allowed three half quarters of brandy
or rum, which was distributed every morning,
diluted with a certain quantity of his water,
without either sugar or fruit to render it palatable,
for which reason this composition, was by the
sailors not unaptly stiled Necessity. Nor was this
limitation of simple element owing to a scarcity
of it on board, there being at this time
water enough in the ship for a voyage of six
months, at the rate of half a gallon per day to
each man: But this fast must (I suppose) have
been injoined by way of pennance on the ship's
company for their sins; or rather with a view to
mortify them into a contempt of life, that they
might thereby become more resolute and regardless
of danger. How simply then do those people
argue, who ascribe the great mortality among
us, to our bad provision and want of water; 

and affirm, that a great many valuable lives might
have been saved, if the useless transports had been
employed in fetching fresh stock, turtle, fruit,
and other refreshments, from Jamaica and other
adjacent islands, for the use of the army and
fleet! seeing, it is to be hoped, that those who
died went to a better place, and those who survived
were the more easily maintained. —After
all, a sufficient number remained to fall before
the walls of St. Lazar, where they behaved like
their own country mastiss, which shut their eyes,
run into the jaws of a bear, and have their heads
crushed for their valour. 
But to return to my narration: After having
put garrisons into the forts we had taken, and
re imbarked out soldiers and artillery, which detained
us more than a week, we ventured up to
the mouth of the inner harbour, guarded by a
large fortification on one side, and a small re-doubt
on the other, both of which were deserted
before our approach, and the entrance of the
harbour blocked up by several old galleons that
the enemy had sunk in the channel. —We made
shift, however, to open a passage for some ships
of war, that favoured the second landing of our
troops at a place called La Quinta, not far from
the town, where, after a faint resistance from a
body of Spaniards, who opposed their disembarkation,
they encamped with a design of besieging
the castle of St. Lazar, which overlooked and
commanded the city: Whether our renowned
general had no body in his army who knew how
to approach it in form, or that he trusted intirely
to the fame of his arms, I shall not determine; 
but certain it is, a resolution was taken in 

a council of war, to attack the place with mufquetry
only, which was put in execution, and
succeeded accordingly; the enemy giving them
such an hearty reception, that the greatest part
of the detachment took up their everlasting residence
on the spot. —Our chief not relishing this
kind of complaisance in the Spaniards, was wise
enough to retreat on board with the remains of
his army, which, from eight thousand able men
landed on the beach near Bocca Chica, was now
reduced to fifteen hundred fit for service. —The
sick and wounded were squeezed into certain
vessels, which thence obtained the name of hospital
ships, though methinks they scarce deserved
such a creditable title, seeing none of them could
boast of either surgeon, nurse or cook; and the
space between decks was so confined, that the
miserable patients had not room to sit upright in
their beds. Their wounds and stumps being neglected,
contracted filth and putrefaction, and
millions of maggots were hatched amid the corruption
of their fores. This inhuman disregard
was imputed to the scarcity of surgeons; though
it is well known, that every great ship in the
fleet could have spared one at least for this duty,
which would have been more than sufficient to
remove this shocking inconvenience: But, perhaps,
the general was too much of a gentleman
to ask a favour of this kind from his fellow-chief,
who on the other hand, would not derogate so far
from his own dignity, as to offer such assistance
unasked; for I may venture to affirm, that by
this time, the Dæmon of discord with her footy
wings, had breathed her influence upon our counsels; 
and it might be said of these great men, 

(I hope they will pardon the comparison) as of
Cæsar and Pompey, the one could not brook a
superior, and the other was impatient of an equal: 
So that between the pride of one, and
insolence of another, the enterprize miscarried,
according to the proverb, “Between two stools
the backside falls to the ground.” —Not that
I would be thought to liken any publick concern
to that opprobrious part of the human body, although
I might with truth assert, if I durst use
such a vulgar idiom, that the nation did hang an
a&wblank;se at its disappointment on this occasion; neither
would I presume to compare the capacity of
our heroic leaders to any such wooden convenience
as a joint-stool or a close-stool; but only
signify by this simile, the mistake the people committed
in trusting to the union of two instruments
that were never joined. 
A day or two after the attempt on St. Lazar,
the admiral ordered one of the Spanish men of
war we had taken, to be mounted with sixteen
guns, and manned with detachments from our
great ships, in order to batter the town; accordingly,
she was towed into the inner harbour in
the night-time, and moored within half a mile of
the walls, against which she began to fire at daybreak; 
and continued about four hours exposed
to the opposition of at least forty pieces of cannon,
which at length obliged our men to set her
on fire, and get off as well as they could, in
their boats. —This piece of conduct afforded matter
of speculation to all the wits, either in the
army or the navy, who were at last fain to acknowledge
it a stroke of policy above their comprehension. 
—Some entertained such an irreverent 

opinion of the admiral's understanding, as
to think he expected the town would surrender
to his floating battery of sixteen guns: Others
imagined his sole intention was to try the enemy's
strength, by which he would be able to
compute the number of great ships that would
be necessary to bring the Spaniards to a capitulation: 
But this last conjecture soon appeared
groundless, in as much as no ships of any kind
whatever were afterwards employed on that service. 
—A third sort swore, that no other cause
could be assigned for this undertaking, than that
which induced Don Quixote to attack the windmill. 
A fourth class (and that the most numerous,
though without doubt, composed of the
sanguine and malicious) plainly taxed this commander
with want of honesty as well as sense; 
and alledged that he ought to have sacrificed private
pique to the interest of his country; that
where the lives of so many brave fellow citizens
were concerned, he ought to have concurred with
the general, without being sollicited or even desired,
towards their preservation and advantage; 
that if his arguments could not dissuade him from
a desperate enterprize, it was his duty to render it
as practicable as possible, without running extreme
hazard; that this could have been done,
with a good prospect of success, by ordering five
or six large ships to batter the town while the
land forces stormed the castle, by this means, a
considerable diversion would have been made in
favour of those troops, who in their march to
the assault and in the retreat, suffered much more
from the town than from the castle; that the inhabitants
seeing themselves vigorously attacked on 

all hands, would have been divided, distracted and
confused, and in all probability, unable to resist
the assailants. —But all these suggestions surely
proceed from ignorance and malevolence, or else the
admiral would not have found it such an easy matter,
as his return to England, to justify his conduct
to a ministry at once so upright and discerning. — 
True it is, that those who undertook to vindicate
him on the spot, asserted, there was not water
enough for our great ships near the town; tho'
this was a little unfortunately urged, because
there happened to be pilots in the fleet perfectly
well acquainted with the soundings of the harbour,
who affirmed there was water enough for
five eighty gun ships to lye a-breast in, almost
up at the very walls. —The disappointments we suffered,
occasioned an universal dejection, which
was not at all alleviated by the objects that daily
and hourly entertained our eyes, nor by the prospect
of what must inevitably happen, if we remained
much longer in this place. —Such was the
œconomy in some ships, that, rather than be at
the trouble of interring the dead, their commanders
ordered their men to throw the bodies over-board,
many without either ballast or winding-sheet; 
so that numbers of human carcasses floated in the
harbour, until they were devoured by sharks and
carrion crows; which afforded no agreeable spectacle
to those who survived. —At the same time
the wet season began, during which, a deluge of
rain falls from the rising to the setting of the
sun, without intermission; and that no sooner
ceases, than it begins to thunder and lighten with
such continual flashing, that one can see to read
a very small print by the illumination.
