We depart for Europe—a misunderstanding
arises between the captain and surgeon,
through the scandalous aspersions of Crampley
—the captain dies—Crampley tyrannizes
over the surgeon, who falls a victim to
his cruelty—I am also ill used—the
ship strikes—the behaviour of Crampley and
the seamen on that occasion. —I get on shore,
challenge the captain to single combat— 
am treacherously knocked down, wounded
and robbed. 
Now that I could return to my native
country in a creditable way, I felt excessive
pleasure in finding myself out of sight
of that fatal island, which has been the grave of 

so many Europeans; and as I was accommodated
with every thing to render the passage agreeable,
I resolved to enjoy myself as much as the
insolence of Crampley would permit. —This insidious
slanderer had found means already to
cause a misunderstanding between the surgeon and
captain, who by his age and infirmities was rendered
intolerably peevish, his disposition having also
been sowred by a long course of disappointments,
and had a particular aversion to all young men,
especially to surgeons, whom he considered as unnecessary
animals on board of a ship. —In consequence
of these sentiments, he never consulted
the doctor, notwithstanding his being seized with
a violent fit of the gout and gravel, but applied
to a cask of Holland-gin, which was his sovereign
prescription against all distempers: But whether
he was at this time too sparing, or took an overdose
of his cordial, certain it is, he departed in
the night, without any ceremony, which indeed
was a thing he always despised, and was found
stiff, next morning, to the no small satisfaction
of Crampley, who succeeded to the command of
the vessel. —For that very reason, Mr. Tomlins
and I had no cause to rejoice at this event, fearing
that the tyranny of our new commander would
now be as unlimited as his power. —The first day
of his command justified our apprehension: For
on pretence that the decks were too much
crowded, he ordered the surgeon's hen-coops,
with all his fowls, to be thrown over-board; and
at the same time, prohibited him and me from
appearing on the quarter-deck. Mr. Tomlins
could not help complaining of these injuries, and
in the course of his expostulation dropped some
hasty words, of which Crampley taking hold, 

confined him to his cabbin, where, in a few days,
for want of air, he was attacked by a fever,
which soon put an end to his life, after having
made his will, by which he bequeathed all his
estate, personal and real, to his sister; and left to
me his watch and instruments, as remembrances of
his friendship. —I was penetrated with grief on this
melancholy occasion! the more because there was
no body on board, to whom I could communicate
my griefs, or of whom I could receive the least
consolation or advice. —Crampley was so far from
discovering the least remorse for his barbarity, at
the news of the surgeon's death, that he insulted
his memory in the most abusive manner, and affirmed
he had poisoned himself out of pure fear,
dreading to be brought to a court-martial for mutiny; 
for which reason, he would not suffer the
service of the dead to be read over his body before
it was thrown over-board. 
Nothing but a speedy deliverance could have
supported me under the brutal sway of this bashaw; 
who to render my life the more irksome,
signified to my mess-mates, a desire that I should
be expelled from their society. —This was no
sooner hinted, than they granted his request; and
I was fain to eat in a solitary manner by myself
during the rest of the passage, which however
soon drew to a period. 
We had been seven weeks at sea, when the
gunner told the captain, that by his reckoning
we must be in soundings, and desired he would
order the lead to be heaved. —Crampley swore,
he did not know how to keep the ship's way, for
we were not within a hundred leagues of soundings,
and therefore he would not give himself the
trouble to cast the lead. —Accordingly, we continued 

our course all that afternoon and night,
without shortening fail, although the gunner pretended
to discover Scilly light; and next morning
protested in form against the captain's conduct; 
for which he was put in confinement. —We discovered
no land all that day, and Crampley was
still so infatuated as to neglect sounding: But at
three o'clock in the morning, the ship struck,
and remained fast on a sand bank. This accident
alarmed the whole crew; the boat was immediately
hoisted out, but as we could not discern
which way the shore lay, we were obliged to wait
for day-light. In the mean time, the wind increased,
and the waves beat against the sloop
with such violence, that we expected she would
have gone to pieces. The gunner was released
and consulted: He advised the captain to cut away
the mast, in order to lighten her; this was
performed without success: The sailors seeing
things in a desperate situation, according to
custom, broke up the chests belonging to the
officers, dressed themselves in their cloaths, drank
their liquors without ceremony; and drunkenness,
tumult, and confusion ensued. —In the
midst of this uproar, I went below to secure my
own effects; and found the carpenter's mate
hewing down the purser's cabbin with his hatchet,
whistling all the while, with great composure. 
When I asked his intention in so doing, he replied
very calmly, “I only want to taste the
purser's rum, that's all, master.” —At that
instant the purser coming down, and seeing his
effects going to wreck, complained bitterly of
the injustice done to him, and asked the fellow
what occasion he had for liquor, when in all
likelihood he would be in eternity in a few minutes. 

“All's one for that (said the plunderer)
let us live while we can.” —“Miserable
wretch that thou art! (cried the purser) what
must be thy lot in the other world, if thou
diest in the commission of robbery?” — 
“Why, hell, I suppose, (replied the other, with
great deliberation,)” while the purser fell on
his knees and begged of heaven that we might
not all perish for the sake of one Jonas. — 
During this dialogue, I cloathed myself in my
best apparel, girded on my hanger, stuck my
pistols loaded in my belt, disposed of all my
valuable moveables about my person, and
came upon deck, with a resolution of taking the
first opportunity to get on shore, which, when
the day broke, appeared at the distance of three
miles a-head. —Crampley finding his efforts to get
the ship off ineffectual, determined to consult his
own safety, by going into the boat, which he had
no sooner done, than the ship's company followed
so fast, that she would have sunk along-side, had
not some one wiser than the rest cut the rope and
put off. —But before this happened, I had made
several attempts to get in, and was always baulked
by the captain, who was so eager in excluding
me, that he did not mind the endeavours of any
other body. —Enraged at this inhuman partiality,
and seeing the rope cut, I pulled one of my
pistols from my belt, and cocking it, swore I
would shoot any man who should presume to obstruct
my entrance. So saying, I leaped with
my full exertion, and got on board of the boat
with the loss of the skin of one of my shins. — 
I chanced in my descent to overturn Crampley,
who no sooner got up than he struck at me several
times with a cutlass, and ordered the men to 

throw me overboard; but they were too anxious
about their own safety to mind what he said. — 
Though the boat was very deeply loaded, and the
sea terribly high, we made shift to get upon dry
land in less than an hour after we parted
from the sloop. —As soon as I set foot on terra
firma, my indignation, which had boiled so long
within me, broke out against Crampley, whom
I immediately challenged to single combat, presenting
my pistols, that he might take his choice: 
He took one without hesitation, and before I
could cock the other fired in my face throwing
the pistol after the shot. —I felt myself stunned,
and imagining the bullet had entered my
brain, discharged mine as quick as possible,
that I might not die unrevenged; then flying
upon my antagonist, knocked out several
of his fore-teeth with the but-end of the piece; 
and would certainly have made an end of him
with that instrument, had he not disengaged himself,
and seized his cutlass, which he had given to
his servant when he received the pistol. Seeing
him armed in this manner, I drew my hanger,
and having flung my pistol at his head, closed
with him in a transport of fury, and thrust my
weapon into his mouth, which it enlarged on
one side to his ear. —Whether the smart of this
wound disconcerted him, or the unevenness of the
ground made him reel, I know not, but he staggered
some paces back: I followed close, and with
one stroke cut the tendons of the back of his hand,
upon which his cutlass dropt, and he remained
defenceless. —I know not with what cruelty my
rage might have inspired me, if I had not at
that instant, been felled to the ground by a blow
on the back part of my head, which deprived me 

of all sensation. —When I received the use of
my understanding, I found myself alone in a desolate
place, stript of my cloaths, money, watch,
buckles, and every thing but my shoes, stockings,
breeches, and shirt. —What a discovery must this
be to me, who but an hour before, was worth
sixty guineas in cash! I cursed the hour of my
birth, the parents that gave me being, the sea
that did not swallow me up, the poignard of the
enemy, which could not find the way to my
heart, the villainy of those who had left me in
that miserable condition, and in the exstacy of despair,
resolved to lie still where I was and perish.
