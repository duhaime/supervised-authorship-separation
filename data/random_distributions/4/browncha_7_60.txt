To Jane Talbot.
New-York, October 9.
My dear Madam,

You judge truly when you imagine that your
character and history are not unknown to me;
and such is my opinion of you, that there is probably
no person in the world more solicitous for
your happiness, and more desirous to answer
any enquiries in a manner agreeable to you.
Mr. Colden has made no secret to us of the
relation in which he stood to you. We are well
acquainted with the cause of your late separation.
Will you excuse me for expressing the
deep regret which that event gave me? That
regret is the deeper, since the measures which





he immediately adopted, has put it out of his
power to profit by any change in your views.
My husband's brother being on the point of
embarking in a voyage to the western coast of
America and to China, Mr. Colden prevailed upon
his friends to permit him to embark also,
as a joint adventurer in the voyage. They have
been gone already upwards of a year. We
have not heard of them since their touching at
Tobago and Brazil.
The voyage will be very tedious, but as it
will open scenes of great novelty to the mind
of our friend, and as it may not be unprofitable
to him, we were the more easily disposed to
acquiesce.
Permit me, Madam, to proffer you my warmest
esteem and my kindest services. Your letter
I regard as a flattering proof of your good
opinion, which I shall be most happy to deserve
and to improve, by answering every enquiry
you may be pleased to make respecting one, for
whom I have ever entertained the affection be
coming a sister.

I am, &c.
M. Montford.
P. S. Mr. Montford desires to join me in my
offers of service, and in my good wishes.
