All were asleep at the cottage, when
lord Colambre arrived, except the widow,
who was sitting up, waiting for
him; and who had brought her dog
into the house, that he might not fly
at him, or bark at his return. She had a
roast chicken ready for her guest, and it
was—but this she never told him—the
only chicken she had left; all the
others had been sent with the duty
fowl, as a present to the under agent's
lady. While he was eating his supper,
which he ate with the better appetite,
as he had had no dinner, the good
woman took down from the shelf a
pocket-book, which she gave him: “Is
not that your book?” said she, “My
boy Brian found it after you in the potato
furrow, where you dropped it.”

“Thank you,” said Lord Colambre; 
“there are bank notes in it, which I
could not afford to lose.”
“Are there,” said she: “he never
opened it—nor I.”
Then, in answer to his inquiries
about Grace and the young man, the
widow answered, “They are all in
heart now, I thank ye kindly, sir, for
asking; they'll sleep easy to night any
way, and I'm in great spirits for them
and myself—for all's smooth now.— 
After we parted you, Brian saw Mr.
Dennis himself about the lase and memorandum,
which he never denied,
but knew nothing about. ‘But, be that
as it may,’ says he, ‘you're improving
tenants, and I'm confident my brother
will consider ye; so what you'll do is,
you'll give up the possession to morrow
to myself, that will call for it by
cock-crow, just for form's sake; and
then go up to the castle with the new
lase ready drawn, in your hand, and if
all's paid off clear of the rent, and all

that's due, you'll get the new lase
signed, I'll promise you that upon the
word and honour of a gentleman.’— 
And there's no going beyond that, you
know, sir.—So my boy came home as
light as a feather, and as gay as a lark,
to bring us the good news; only he
was afraid we might not make up the
rent, guineas and all; and because he
could not get paid for the work he
done, on account of the mistake in the
overseer's tally, I sold the cow to a
neighbour—dog-cheap;—but needs
must, as they say, when old Nick
drives, said the widow, smiling. Well,
still it was but paper we got for the
cow; then that must be gold before
the agent would take, or touch it—so
I was laying out to sell the dresser,
and had taken the plates and cups, and
little things off it, and my boy was
lifting it out with Andy the carpenter,
that was agreeing for it, when in comes
Grace, all rosy, and out of breath— 
it's a wonder I minded her run out,

and not missed her—Mother, says she,
here's the gold for you, don't be stirring
your dresser.—And where's your
gown and cloak, Grace? says I. But,
I beg your pardon, sir; may be I'm
tiring you?”
Lord Colambre encouraged her to go
on.
“Where's your gown and cloak,
Grace, says I.—‘Gone,’ says she. ‘The
cloak was too warm and heavy, and I
don't doubt, mother, but it was that
helped to make me faint this morning.
And as to the gown, sure I've a very
nice one here, that you spun for me
yourself, mother; and that I prize
above all the gowns ever came out of a
loom; and that Brian said become me
to his fancy above any gown ever he
see me wear, and what could I wish
for more.’—Now I'd a mind to scold her
for going to sell the gown unknown'st
to me, but I don't know how it was,
I couldn't scold her just then, so kissed
her, and Brian the same, and that was

what no man ever did before.—And
she had a mind to be angry with him,
but could not, nor ought not, says I; 
for he's as good as your husband now,
Grace; and no man can part yees now,
says I, putting their hands together.— 
Well, I never saw her look so pretty; 
nor there was not a happier boy that
minute on God's Earth than my son,
nor a happier mother than myself; and
I thanked God that had given them to
me; and down they both fell on their
knees for my blessing, little worth as
it was; and my heart's blessing they
had, and I laid my hands upon them.
‘It's the priest you must get to do
this for you to morrow,’ says I. And
Brian just held up the ring, to show me
all was ready on his part, but could
not speak. ‘Then there's no America
any more!’ said Grace, low to me,
and her heart was on her lips; but the
colour came and went, and I was a
feard she'd have swooned again, but
not for sorrow, so I carried her off.

Well, if she was not my own—but she
is not my own born, so I may say it— 
there never was a better girl, nor a
more kind hearted, nor generous; never
thinking any thing she could do, or
give, too much for them she loved,
and any thing at all would do for herself; 
the sweetest natured and tempered
both, and always was, from this
high, the bond that held all together,
and joy of the house.”
“Just like her namesake,” cried
lord Colambre.
“Plase your honour!”
“Is not it late?” said lord Colambre,
stretching himself and gaping; 
“I've walked a great way to day.”
The old woman lighted his rushlight,
showed him to his red check bed, and
wished him a very good night; not
without some slight sentiment of displeasure
at his gaping thus, at the panegyric
on her darling Grace. Before
she left the room, however, her short-lived
resentment vanished, upon his

saying that he hoped, with her permission,
to be present at the wedding of
the young couple.
Early in the morning Brian went to
the priest, to ask his reverence when it
would be convenient to marry him; 
and, whilst he was gone, Mr. Dennis
Garraghty came to the cottage, to receive
the rent and possession. The
rent was ready, in gold, and counted
into his hand.
“No occasion for a receipt; for a
new lase is a receipt in full for every
thing.”
“Very well, sir,” said the widow; 
“I know nothing of law.—You know
best—whatever you direct—for you are
acting as a friend to us now. My son
got the attorney to draw the pair of
new lases yesterday, and here they are
ready, all to signing.”
Mr. Dennis said, his brother must
settle that part of the business, and
that they must carry them up to the

castle; “but first give me the possession.”
Then, as he instructed her, she gave
up the key of the door to him, and a
bit of the thatch of the house; and he
raked out the fire, and said every living
creature must go out.—“It's only
form of law,” said he.
“And must my lodger get up and
turn out, sir,” said she.
“He must turn out to be sure—not
a living soul must be left in it, or its
no legal possession properly. Who is
your lodger?”
On lord Colambre's appearing, Mr.
Dennis showed some surprise, and said,
“I thought you were lodging at Brannagan's; 
are not you the man who
spoke to me at his house about the gold
mines?”
“No, sir, he never lodged at Brannagan's,” 
said the widow.
“Yes, sir, I am the person who
spoke to you about the gold mines at

Brannagan's; but I did not like to
lodge—”
“Well, no matter where you liked to
lodge; you must walk out of this lodging
now, if you please, my good friend.”
So Mr. Dennis pushed his lordship
out by the shoulders, repeating, as the
widow turned back and looked with
some surprise and alarm, “only for
form sake, only for form sake!” Then
locking the door, took the key and put
it into his pocket. The widow held out
her hand for it: “The form's gone
through now, sir; is not it? Be plased
to let us in again.”
“When the new lease is signed, I'll
give you possession again; but not till
then—for that's the law. So make
away with you to the castle, and mind,” 
added he, winking slily; “mind you
take sealing-money with you, and something
to buy gloves.”
“O, where will I find all that?” said
the widow: “I have it, mother, don't
fret,” said Grace. “I have it—the price

of—what I can want . So let us go off to
the castle without delay. Brian will meet
us on the road, you know.”
They set off for Clonbrony castle,
lord Colambre accompanying them.
Brian met them on the road. “Father
Tom is ready, dear mother, bring her in,
and he'll marry us; I'm not my own
man till she's mine. Who knows what
may happen.”
“Who knows? that's true,” said
the widow.
“Better go to the castle first,” said
Grace.
“And keep the priest waiting! You
can't use his reverence so,” said Brian.
So she let him lead her into the
priest's house, and she did not make
any of the awkward draggings back, or
ridiculous scenes of grimace sometimes
exhibited on these occasions, but blushing
rosy red, yet with more self-possession
than could have been expected
from her timid nature, she gave her

hand to the man she loved, and listened
with attenitve devotion to the holy ceremony.
“Ah!” thought lord Colambre,
whilst he congratulated the bride; 
“shall I ever be as happy as these poor
people are at this moment?” He longed
to make them some little present, but all
he could venture at this moment was to
pay the priest's dues.
The priest positively refused to take
any thing. “They are the best couple
in my parish,” said he; “and I'll take
nothing, sir, from you, a stranger and
my guest.”
“Now come what will, I'm a match
for it. No trouble can touch me,” said
Brian.
“O, don't be bragging,” said the
widow.
“Whatever trouble God sends, he
has given one now will help to bear it,
and sure I may be thankful,” said
Grace.
“Such good hearts must be happy,

shall be happy,” said lord Colambre.
—“O, you're very kind,” said the widow,
smiling; “and I wouldn't doubt
you, if you had the power. I hope then
the agent will give you encouragement
about them mines, that we may keep
you among us.”
“I am determined to settle among you,
warm hearted, generous people,” cried
lord Colambre; “whether the agent gives
me encouragement or not,” added he.
It was a long walk to Clonbrony
castle; the old woman, as she said herself,
would not have been able for it,
but for a lift given to her by a friendly
carman whom they met on the road with
an empty car. This carman was Finnucan,
who dissipated lord Colambre's
fears of meeting and being recognised
by Mrs. Raffarty, for he, in answer to the
question of, Who is at the castle? replied,
“Mrs. Raffarty will be in it afore
night; but she's on the road still.
There's none but old Nick in it yet; and
he's more of a neger than ever; for

think, that he would not pay me a farthing
for the carriage of his shister's
boxes and band-boxes down. If you're
going to have any dealings with him,
God grant ye a safe deliverance.”
“Amen!” said the widow, and her
son and daughter.
Lord Colambre's attention was now
engaged by the view of the castle and
park of Clonbrony. He had not seen
it since he was six years old. Some
faint reminiscence from his childhood
made him feel or fancy that he knew the
place. It was a fine castle, spacious
park: but all about it, from the broken
piers at the great entrance, to the mossy
gravel and loose steps at the hall-door,
had an air of desertion and melancholy.
Walks overgrown, shrubberies wild,
plantations run up into bare poles; fine
trees cut down and lying on the gravel
in lots, to be sold. A hill that had been
covered with an oak wood, in which, in
his childhood, our hero used to play,
and which he called the black forest,

was gone; nothing to be seen but the
white stumps of the trees, for it had
been freshly cut down, to make up
the last remittances.—“And how it
went, when sold!—but no matter,” said
Finnucan. “It's all alike.—It's the
back way into the yard, I'll take you,
I suppose—
And such a yard! “But it's no matter,” 
repeated Lord Colambre to himself.
“It's all alike.”
In the kitchen a great dinner was
dressing for Mr. Garraghty's friends,
who were to make merry with him
when the business of the day was over.
“Where's the keys of the cellar, till
I get out the claret for after dinner,” 
says one; “and the wine, for the cook,
—sure there's venison,” cries another.
“Venison!—That's the way my lord's
deer goes,” says a third, laughing.— 
“Ay, sure! and very proper when
he's not here to eat 'em.”—“Keep
your nose out of the kitchen, young
man, if you plase,” said the agent's

cook shutting the door in lord Colambre's
face.—“There's the way to
the office, if you've money to pay, up
the back stairs.”
“No; up the grand staircase they
must, Mr. Garraghty ordered,” said the
footman, “because the office is damp
for him, and it's not there he'll see any
body to day, but in my lady's dressing
room.”
So up the grand staircase they went,
and through the magnificent apartments,
hung with pictures of great value spoiling
with damp.—“Then isn't it a pity
to see them! There's my lady, and all
spoiling,” said the widow.
Lord Colambre stopped before a portrait
of miss Nugent—“Shamefully
damaged!” cried he.—“Pass on, or
let me pass, if you plase,” said one of
the tenants, “and don't be stopping
the door-way.” “I have business more
nor you with the agent:” said the surveyor
—“where is he?”
“In the presence-chamber,” replied

another: “Where should the viceroy
be, but in the presence-chamber?”
There was a full levee, and fine smell
of great coats.—“O! would you put
your hats on the silk cushions?” said
the widow to some men in the door-way,
who were throwing off their greasy
hats on a damask sofa.—“Why
not? where else?”—“If the lady was
in it, you wouldn't,” said she, sighing.
—“No, to be sure, I wouldn't: great
news! would I make no differ in the
presence of old Nick and my lady?” 
said he, in Irish.—“Have I no sense
or manners, good woman, think ye?” 
added he, as he shook the ink out of
his pen on the Wilton carpet, when he
had finished signing his name to a paper
on his knee.—“You may wait long
before you get to the speech of the great
man,” said another, who was working
his way through numbers. They continued
pushing forward, till they came
within sight of Mr. Nicholas Garraghty,
seated in state; and a worse countenance,

or a more perfect picture of an
insolent, petty tyrant in office, lord
Colambre had never beheld.
We forbear all further detail of this
levee. “It's all the same!” as lord
Colambre repeated to himself, on every
fresh instance of roguery or oppression
to which he was witness; and having
completely made up his mind on the
subject, he sat down quietly in the
back ground, waiting till it should come
to the widow's turn to be dealt with,
for he was now interested only to see
how she would be treated. The room
gradually thinned: Mr. Dennis Garraghty
came in and sat down at the table
to help his brother to count the
heaps of gold.
“O, Mr. Dennis, I'm glad to see you
as kind as your promise, meeting me
here,” said the widow O'Neill, walking
up to him,—“I'm sure you'll speak
a good word for me—here's the lases— 
who will I offer this to?” said she

holding the glove-money and sealingmoney,
for I'm strange and ashamed?”
“O, don't be ashamed—there's no
strangeness in bringing money or taking
it,” said Mr. Nicholas Garraghty, holding
out his hand. “Is this the proper
compliment?”
“I hope so, sir: your honour knows
best.”—
“Very well,” slipping it into his
private purse.—“Now, what's your
business?”
“The lases to sign—the rent's all paid
up.”
“Leases! Why, woman! is the possession
given up?,,
“It was, plase your honour; and
Mr. Dennis has the key of our little
place in his pocket.”
“Then I hope he'll keep it there.— 
Your little place—it's no longer yours,
I've promised it to the surveyor. You
don't think I'm such a fool as to renew
to you at this rent.”

Mr. Dennis named the rent—“but
any thing your honour plases—any
thing at all that we can pay.”
“O, it's out of the question—put
it out of your head. No rent you can
offer would do, for I've promised it to
the surveyor.”
“Sir, Mr. Dennis knows my lord
gave us his promise in writing of a renewal,
on the back of the ould lase.”
“Produce it.”
“Here's the lase, but the promise is
rubbed out.”
“Nonsense! coming to me with a
promise that's rubbed out. Who'll
listen to that in a court of justice, do
you think?”
“I don't know, plase your honour; 
but this I'm sure of, my lord and miss
Nugent, though but a child at the
time, God bless her, who was by when
my lord wrote it with his pencil, will
remember it.”
“Miss Nugent! What can she know
of business?—What has she to do

with the management of my lord Clonbrony's
estate, pray?”
“Management!—no, sir.”
“Do you wish to get miss Nugent
turned out of the house.”
“O, God forbid!—how could that
be?”
“Very easily; if you set about to
make her meddle and witness in what
my lord does not choose.”
“Well, then I'll never mention miss
Nugent's name in it at all, if it was
ever so with me. But be plased, sir,
to write over to my lord, and ask him; 
I'm sure he'll remember it.”
“Write to my lord about such a
trifle—trouble him about such nonsense!”
“I'd be sorry to trouble him. Then
take it on my word, and believe me,
sir; for I would not tell a lie, nor cheat
rich or poor, if in my power, for the
whole estate, nor the whole world: for
there's an eye above.”
“Cant! nonsense!—Take those

leases off the table; I never will sign
them. Walk off, ye canting hag! it's
an imposition—I will never sign them.”
“You will then, sir,” cried Brian,
growing red with indignation; “for the
law shall make you, so it shall—and
you'd as good have been civil to my
mother, whatever you did—for I'll
stand by her while I've life; and I
know she has right, and shall have law.
I saw the memorandum written before
ever it went into your hands, sir, whatever
became of it after; and will swear
to it, too.”
“Swear away, my good friend; 
much your swearing will avail in your
own case in a court of justice,” continued
old Nick.
“And against a gentleman of my
brother's established character and property,” 
said St. Dennis. “What's
your mother's character against a gentleman's,
like his!”
“Character! take care how you go
to that, any way, sir,” cried Brian.

Grace put her hand before his mouth,
to stop him.
“Grace! dear! I must speak, if I
die for it; sure it's for my mother,” 
said the young man, struggling forward,
while his mother held him back, “I
must speak.”
“Oh, he's ruin'd, I see it,” said
Grace, putting her hand before her eyes,
“and he won't mind me.”
“Go on, let him go on, pray, young
woman,” said Mr. Garraghty, pale with
anger and fear, his lips quivering; “I
shall be happy to take down his
words.”
“Write them; and may all the world
read it, and welcome.”
His mother and wife stopped his
mouth by force.
“Write you, Dennis,” said Mr. Garraghty,
giving the pen to his brother; 
for his hand shook so, he could not
form a letter. “Write the very words,
and at the top—(pointing)—after warning,
with malice prepense.”

“Write, then—mother, Grace—let
me,” cried Brian, speaking in a smothered
voice, as their hands were over
his mouth. “Write then, that if you'd
either of you a character like my mother,
you might defy the world; and
your word would be as good as your
oath.”
“Oath! mind that Dennis,” said
Mr. Garraghty.
“Oh, sir! sir! won't you stop him?” 
cried Grace, turning suddenly to lord
Colambre.
“Oh dear, dear! if you havn't lost
your feeling for us,” cried the widow.
“Let him speak,” said lord Colambre,
in a tone of authority; “let the
voice of truth be heard.”
“Truth!” cried St. Dennis, and
dropped the pen.
“And who the devil are you, sir?” 
said old Nick.
“Lord Colambre, I protest!” exclaimed
a female voice; and Mrs. Raffarty

at this instant appeared at the open
door.”
“Lord Colambre!” repeated all present,
in different tones.
“My lord, I beg pardon,” continued
Mrs. Raffarty, advancing as if her legs
were tied; “had I known you was
down here, I would not have presumed.
I'd better retire; for I see you're busy.”
“You'd best; for you're mad, sister,” 
said Saint Dennis, pushing her
back; “and we are busy: go to your
room, and keep quiet, if you can.”
“First, madam,” said lord Colambre,
going between her and the door; 
“let me beg that you will consider
yourself as at home in this house,
whilst any circumstances make it desirable
to you. The hospitality you
showed me, you cannot think that I
now forget.”
“Oh, my lord, you're too good— 
how few—too kind—kinder than my
own,” and bursting into tears, she
escaped out of the room.

Lord Colambre returned to the party
round the table, who were in various
attitudes of astonishment, and with faces
of fear, horrour, hope, joy, doubt.
“Distress,” continued his lordship,
“however incurred, if not by vice, will
always find a refuge in this house. I
speak in my father's name, for I know
I speak his sentiments. But never more
shall vice,” said he, darting such a look
at the brother agents as they felt to the
back bone—“never more shall vice,
shall fraud enter here.”
He paused, and there was a momentary
silence.
“There spoke the true thing! and the
rael gentleman; my own heart's satisfied,” 
said Brian, folding his arms, and
standing erect.
“Then so is mine,” said Grace, taking
breath, with a deep sigh.
The widow advancing, put on her
spectacles, and looking up close at lord
Colambre's face, “Then it's a wonder I
didn't know the family likeness.”

Lord Colambre now recollecting that
he still wore the old great coat, threw it
off.
“O, bless him! Then now I'd know
him any where. I'm willing to die now,
for we'll all be happy.”
“My lord, since it is so: my lord,
may I ask you,” said Mr. Garraghty,
now sufficiently recovered to be able to
articulate, but scarcely to express his
ideas; “if what your lordship hinted
just now—”
“I hinted nothing, sir; I spoke
plainly.”
“I beg pardon, my lord,” said old
Nick; “respecting vice was levelled at
me; because, if it was, my lord,” trying
to stand erect; “let me tell your
lordship, if I could think it was—”
“If it did not hit you, sir, no matter
at whom it was levelled.”
“And let me ask, my lord, if I may
presume, whether in what you suggested
by the word fraud, your lordship had any
particular meaning?” said St. Dennis

“A very particular meaning, sir,— 
feel in your pocket for the key of this
widow's house, and deliver it to her.”
“O, if that's all the meaning, with
all the pleasure in life. I never meant
to detain it longer than till the leases
were signed,” said St. Dennis.
“And I'm ready to sign the leases
this minute,” said the brother.
“Do it, sir, this minute; I have read
them; I will be answerable to my father.”
“O, as to that, my lord, I have power
to sign for your father.” He signed the
leases; they were duly witnessed by lord
Colambre.
“I deliver this as my act and deed,” 
said Mr. Garraghty:—“my lord,” continued
he, “you see, at the first word
from you; and had I known sooner the
interest you took in the family, there
would have been no difficulty; for I'd
make it a principle to oblige you, my
lord.”
“Oblige me!” said lord Colambre,
with disdain.

“But when gentlemen and noblemen
travel incognito, and lodge in cabins,” 
added St. Dennis, with a satanic
smile, glancing his eye on Grace; “they
have good reasons, no doubt.”
“Do not judge my heart by your
own, sir,” said lord Colambre, cooly; 
“no two things in nature can, I trust,
be more different. My purpose in travelling
incognito has been fully answered:
I was determined to see and
judge how my father's estates were
managed; and I have seen, compared,
and judged. I have seen the difference
between the Clonbrony and the Colambre
property; and I shall represent
what I have seen to my father.”
“As to that my lord, if we are to
come to that—but I trust your lordship
will suffer me to explain these matters.
—Go about your business, my good
friends, you have all you want—and, my
lord, after dinner, when you are cool, I
hope I shall be able to make you sensible
that things have been represented to

your lordship in a mistaken light; and
I flatter myself I shall convince you I
have not only always acted the part of
a friend to the family, but am particularly
willing to conciliate your lordship's
good will,” said he, sweeping the rouleaus
of gold into a bag; “any accommodation
in my power, at any time.”
“I want no accommodation, sir,— 
were I starving I would accept of none
from you. Never can you conciliate my
good will; for you can never deserve
it.”
“If that be the case, my lord, I must
conduct myself accordingly: but it's
fair to warn you, before you make any
representation to my lord Clonbrony,
that, if he should think of changing his
agent, there are accounts to be settled
between us—that may be a consideration.”
“No, sir; no consideration—my father
never shall be the slave of such a
paltry consideration.”
“O, very well, my lord; you know

best. If you choose to make an assumpsit,
I'am sure I shall not object to
the security. Your lordship will be of
age soon, I know—I'm sure, I'm satisfied
—but,” added he, with a malicious
smile, “I rather apprehend you don't
know what you undertake. I only premise,
that the balance of accounts between
us is not what can properly be
called a paltry consideration.”
“On that point, perhaps, sir, you
and I may differ.”
“Very well, my lord, you will follow
your own principles, if it suits your
convenience.”
“Whether it does, or not, sir, I shall
abide by my principles.”
“Dennis! the letters to the post— 
when do you go to England, my lord?”
“Immediately, sir,” said lord Colambre:
his lordship saw new leases
from his father to Mr. Dennis Garraghty,
lying on the table, unsigned.
“Immediately!” repeated Messrs.
Nicholas and Dennis, with an of dismay.

Nicholas got up, looked out of
the window, and whispered something
to his brother, who instantly left the
room.
Lord Colambre saw the post chaise
at the door, which had brought Mrs.
Raffarty to the castle, and Larry standing
beside it: his lordship instantly threw up
the sash, and holding between his finger
and thumb a six shilling piece, cried,
“Larry, my friend, let me have the
horses.”
“You shall have 'em,—your honour,” 
said Larry. Mr. Dennis Garraghty appeared
below, speaking in a magisterial
tone.—“Larry, my brother must have
the horses.”
“He can't, plase your honour, they're
engaged.”
“Half a crown!—a crown! half a
guinea!” said Mr. Dennis Garraghty,
raising his voice, as he increased his
proffer'd bribe.—To each offer Larry
replied, “You can't, plase your honour,
they're engaged.”—And looking up to

the window at Lord Colambre, he said,
“As soon as they have eaten their oats,
you shall have 'em.”
No other horses were to be had.— 
The agent was in consternation.—Lord
Colambre ordered that Larry should
have some dinner, and whilst the postillion
was eating, and the horses finishing
their oats, his lordship wrote the
following letter to his father, which,
to prevent all possibility of accident,
he determined to put (with his own
hand) into the post-office at Clonbrony,
as he passed through the town.
“My dear Father,
I hope to be with you in a few
days. Lest any thing should detain
me on the road, I write this, to make
an earnest request to you, that you
will not sign any papers or transact
any farther business with Messrs.
Nicholas or Dennis Garraghty, before
you see
Your affectionate son,
Colambre.”

The horses came out. Larry sent
word he was ready, and lord Colambre,
having first eaten a slice of his own
venison, ran down to the carriage,
followed by the thanks and blessings of
the widow, her son, and daughter,
who could hardly make their way after
him to the chaise door, so great was
the crowd, which had gathered on the
report of his lordship's arrival.
“Long life to your honour! Long
life to your lordship!” echoed on all
sides.—“Just come, and going, are
you!”
“Good bye to you all, good people.”
“Then good bye is the only word
we wouldn't wish to hear from your
honour.”
“For the sake both of landlord and
tenant, I must leave you now, my good
friends; but I hope to return to you, at
some future time.”
“God bless you! and speed ye!
and a safe journey to your honour!— 
and a happy return to us, and soon!”— 
cried a multitude of voices.

Lord Colambre stopped at the chaise
door, and beckoned to the widow
O'Neill, before whom others had pressed.
An opening was made for her instantly.
“There! that was the very way his
father stood, with his feet on the steps.
And miss Nugent was in it.”
Lord Colambre forgot what he was
going to say,—with some difficulty recollected.
“This pocket book,” said he,
“which your son restored to me,—I intend
it for your daughter—don't keep it,
as your son kept it, for me, without
opening it.—Let what is within side,” 
added he, as he got into the carriage,
“replace the cloak and gown, and let
all things necessary for a bride be
bought, ‘for the bride that has all things
to borrow, has surely mickle to do.’— 
Shut the door, and drive on.”
“Blessings be wid you,” cried the widow,
“and God give you Grace!”
