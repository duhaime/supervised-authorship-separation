To Henry Colden, Senior.
November 26.
S I R,

I was not informed till to-day, of the correspondence
that has passed between you and
my mother, nor of your aversion to the alliance
which was designed to take place between your
son and me.
It is my duty to inform you that, in my opinion,
your approbation was absolutely necessary
to such an union; and consequently, since your
concurrence is withheld, it will never take place.
Every tie or engagement between us, is, from
this moment dissolved, and all intercourse, by
letter or otherwise will here end.






Your son, in opposing your wishes, imagined
himself consulting my happiness. In that he
was mistaken; and I have now removed his error,
by acquainting him with my present determination.

I am deeply grieved that his attachment to
me has forfeited your favor. I hope that there
is no other obstacle to reconcilement, and that
the termination of all intercourse between us
may remove that obstacle.
Jane Talbot.
I join my daughter in assuring you that the
alliance for which a mutual aversion was entertained,
cannot take place; and that all her engagements
with your son are dissolved. I join
her likewise in entreating you to forget his disobedience,
and restore him to your protection
and favor.

M. Fielder.
