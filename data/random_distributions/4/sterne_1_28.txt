The concern which the poor
fellow's story threw me into,
required some attention: the postillion
paid not the least to it, but
set off upon the pavè in a full gallop. 
The thirstiest soul in the most
sandy desert of Arabia could not have
wished more for a cup of cold water,
than mine did for grave and quiet
movements; and I should have had
an high opinion of the postillion had
he but stolen off with me in something
like a pensive pace. —On the 

contrary, as the mourner finished his
lamentation, the fellow gave an unfeeling
lash to each of his beasts, and
set off clattering like a thousand
devils. 
I called to him as loud as I could,
for heaven's sake to go slower—and
the louder I called the more unmercifully
he galloped. —The deuce take
him and his galloping too—said I— 
he'll go on tearing my nerves to
pieces till he has worked me into
a foolish passion, and then he'll go
slow, that I may enjoy the sweets
of it. 
The postillion managed the point
to a miracle: by the time he had got 

to the foot of a steep hill about half
a league from Nampont,—he had
put me out of temper with him— 
and then with myself, for being so. 
My case then required a different
treatment; and a good rattling gallop
would have been of real service to
me.— 
—Then, prithee get on—get on,
my good lad, said I. 
The postillion pointed to the hill 
—I then tried to return back to the
story of the poor German and his
ass—but I had broke the clue—and
could no more get into it again,
than the postillion could into a
trot.— 

—The deuce go, said I, with it
all! Here am I sitting as candidly
disposed to make the best of the
worst, as ever wight was, and all
runs counter. 
There is one sweet lenitive at
least for evils, which nature holds
out to us; so I took it kindly at
her hands, and fell asleep; and the
first word which roused me was
Amiens. 
—Bless me! said I, rubbing my
eyes—this is the very town where my
poor lady is to come.
