I Imagined that I had forever laid a&longs;ide the pen;
and that I &longs;hould take up my abode in this part of
the world, was of all events the lea&longs;t probable.
My de&longs;tiny I believed to be accompli&longs;hed, and I
looked forward to a &longs;peedy termination of my life
with the fulle&longs;t confidence.
Surely I had rea&longs;on to be weary of exi&longs;tence, to
be impatient of every tie which held me from the
grave. I experienced this impatience in its fulle&longs;t
extent. I was not only enamoured of death, but
conceived, from the condition of my frame, that
to &longs;hun it was impo&longs;&longs;ible, even though I had ardently
de&longs;ired it; yet here am I, a thou&longs;and leagues
from my native &longs;oil, in full po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;ion of life and
of health, and not de&longs;titute of happine&longs;s.
Such is man. Time will obliterate the deepe&longs;t
impre&longs;&longs;ions. Grief the mo&longs;t vehement and hopeless,
will gradually decay and wear it&longs;elf out. Arguments
may be employed in vain: every moral
pre&longs;cription may be ineffectually tried: remonstrances,
however cogent or pathetic, &longs;hall have no
power over the attention, or &longs;hall be repelled with
di&longs;dain; yet, as day follows day, the turbulence of
our emotions &longs;hall &longs;ub&longs;ide, and our fluctuations be
finally &longs;ucceeded by a calm.
Perhaps, however, the conque&longs;t of de&longs;pair was
chiefly owing to an accident which rendered my




continuance in my own hou&longs;e impo&longs;&longs;ible. At the
conclu&longs;ion of my long, and as I then &longs;uppo&longs;ed,
my la&longs;t letter to you, I mentioned my re&longs;olution
to wait for death in the very &longs;pot which had been
the principal &longs;cene of my misfortunes. From this
re&longs;olution my friends exerted them&longs;elves with the
utmo&longs;t zeal and per&longs;everance to make me depart.
They ju&longs;tly imagined that to be thus &longs;urrounded by
memorials of the fate of my family, would tend to
fo&longs;ter my di&longs;ea&longs;e. A &longs;wift &longs;ucce&longs;&longs;ion of new objects,
and the exclu&longs;ion of every thing calculated
to remind me of my lo&longs;s, was the only method of
cure.
I refu&longs;ed to li&longs;ten to their exhortations. Great as
my calamity was, to be torn from this a&longs;ylum was
regarded by me as an aggravation of it. By a perverse
con&longs;titution of mind, he was con&longs;idered as my
greate&longs;t enemy who &longs;ought to withdraw me from a
&longs;cene which &longs;upplied eternal food to my melancholy,
and kept my de&longs;pair from langui&longs;hing.
In relating the hi&longs;tory of the&longs;e di&longs;a&longs;ters I derived
a &longs;imilar &longs;pecies of gratification. My uncle earnestly
di&longs;&longs;uaded me from this ta&longs;k; but his remonstrances
were as fruitle&longs;s on this head as they had
been on others. They would have withheld from
me the implements of writing; but they quickly
perceived that to with&longs;tand would be more injurious
than to comply with my wi&longs;hes. Having fini&longs;hed
my tale, it &longs;eemed as if the &longs;cene were clo&longs;ing. A
fever lurked in my veins, and my &longs;trength was
gone. Any exertion, however &longs;light, was attended
with difficulty, and, at length, I refu&longs;ed to ri&longs;e from
my bed.
I now &longs;ee the infatuation and inju&longs;tice of my
conduct in its true colours. I reflect upon the
&longs;en&longs;ations and rea&longs;onings of that period with




wonder and humiliation. That I &longs;hould be in&longs;en&longs;ible
to the claims and tears of my friends; that I &longs;hould
overlook the &longs;ugge&longs;tions of duty, and fly from that
po&longs;t in which only I could be in&longs;trumental to the
benefit of others; that the exerci&longs;e of the &longs;ocial
and beneficent affections, the contemplation of nature
and the acqui&longs;ition of wi&longs;dom &longs;hould not be
&longs;een to be means of happine&longs;s &longs;till within my reach,
is, at this time, &longs;carcely credible.
It is true that I am now changed; but I have
not the con&longs;olation to reflect that my change was
owing to my fortitude or to my capacity for instruction.
Better thoughts grew up in my mind
imperceptibly. I cannot but congratulate my&longs;elf
on the change, though, perhaps, it merely argues
a ficklene&longs;s of temper, and a defect of &longs;en&longs;ibility.
After my narrative was ended I betook my &longs;elf to
my bed, in the full belief that my career in this world
was on the point of fini&longs;hing. My uncle took up
his abode with me, and performed for me every
office of nur&longs;e, phy&longs;ician and friend. One night,
after &longs;ome hours of re&longs;tle&longs;&longs;ne&longs;s and pain, I &longs;unk
into deep &longs;leep. Its tranquillity, however, was of
no long duration. My fancy became &longs;uddenly distempered,
and my brain was turned into a theatre
of uproar and confu&longs;ion. It would not be ea&longs;y to
de&longs;cribe the wild and phanta&longs;tical incongruities that
pe&longs;tered me. My uncle, Wieland, Pleyel and
Carwin were &longs;ucce&longs;&longs;ively and momently di&longs;cerned
amid&longs;t the &longs;torm. Sometimes I was &longs;wallowed up
by whirlpools, or caught up in the air by half-&longs;een
and gigantic forms, and thrown upon pointed rocks,
or ca&longs;t among the billows. Sometimes gleams of
light were &longs;hot into a dark aby&longs;s, on the verge of
which I was &longs;tanding, and enabled me to di&longs;cover,
for a moment, its enormous depth and hideous




precipices. Anon, I was tran&longs;ported to &longs;ome ridge
of Ã†tna, and made a terrified &longs;pectator of its fiery
torrents and its pillars of &longs;moke.
However &longs;trange it may &longs;eem, I was con&longs;cious,
even during my dream, of my real &longs;ituation. I
knew my&longs;elf to be a&longs;leep, and &longs;truggled to break
the &longs;pell, by mu&longs;cular exertions. The&longs;e did not
avail, and I continued to &longs;uffer the&longs;e abortive creations
till a loud voice, at my bed &longs;ide, and &longs;ome
one &longs;haking me with violence, put an end to my
reverie. My eyes were un&longs;ealed, and I &longs;tarted from
my pillow.
My chamber was filled with &longs;moke, which,
though in &longs;ome degree luminous, would permit me
to &longs;ee nothing, and by which I was nearly suffocated.
The crackling of flames, and the deafening
clamour of voices without, bur&longs;t upon my ears.
Stunned as I was by this hubbub, &longs;corched with
heat, and nearly choaked by the accumulating vapours,
I was unable to think or act for my own
pre&longs;ervation; I was incapable, indeed, of comprehending
my danger.
I was caught up, in an in&longs;tant, by a pair of
&longs;inewy arms, borne to the window, and carried
down a ladder which had been placed there. My
uncle &longs;tood at the bottom and received me. I was
not fully aware of my &longs;ituation till I found my&longs;elf
&longs;heltered in the Hut, and &longs;urrounded by its inhabitants.

By neglect of the &longs;ervant, &longs;ome unextingui&longs;hed
embers had been placed in a barrel in the cellar of
the building. The barrel had caught fire; this was
communicated to the beams of the lower floor, and
thence to the upper part of the &longs;tructure. It was
fir&longs;t di&longs;covered by &longs;ome per&longs;ons at a di&longs;tance, who
ha&longs;tened to the &longs;pot and alarmed my uncle and the





&longs;ervants. The flames had already made considerable
progre&longs;s, and my condition was overlooked
till my e&longs;cape was rendered nearly impo&longs;&longs;ible.
My danger being known, and a ladder quickly
procured, one of the &longs;pectators a&longs;cended to my
chamber, and effected my deliverance in the manner
before related.
This incident, di&longs;a&longs;trous as it may at fir&longs;t &longs;eem,
had, in reality, a beneficial effect upon my feelings.
I was, in &longs;ome degree, rou&longs;ed from the &longs;tupor
which had &longs;eized my faculties. The monotonous
and gloomy &longs;eries of my thoughts was broken.
My habitation was levelled with the ground, and I
was obliged to &longs;eek a new one. A new train of
images, di&longs;connected with the fate of my family,
forced it&longs;elf on my attention, and a belief insensibly
&longs;prung up, that tranquillity, if not happine&longs;s, was
&longs;till within my reach. Notwith&longs;tanding the &longs;hocks
which my frame had endured, the angui&longs;h of my
thoughts no &longs;ooner abated than I recovered my
health.
I now willingly li&longs;tened to my uncle's solicitations
to be the companion of his voyage. Preparations
were ea&longs;ily made, and after a tedious passage,
we &longs;et our feet on the &longs;hore of the ancient
world. The memory of the pa&longs;t did not for&longs;ake
me; but the melancholy which it generated, and
the tears with which it filled my eyes, were not unprofitable.
My curio&longs;ity was revived, and I contemplated,
with ardour, the &longs;pectacle of living
manners and the monuments of pa&longs;t ages.
In proportion as my heart was rein&longs;tated in the
po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;ion of its ancient tranquillity, the &longs;entiment
which I had cheri&longs;hed with regard to Pleyel returned.
In a &longs;hort time he was united to the Saxon
woman, and made his re&longs;idence in the




neighbourhood of Bo&longs;ton. I was glad that circum&longs;tances
would not permit an interview to take place between
us. I could not de&longs;ire their mi&longs;ery; but I
reaped no plea&longs;ure from reflecting on their happiness.
Time, and the exertions of my fortitude,
cured me, in &longs;ome degree, of this folly. I continued
to love him, but my pa&longs;&longs;ion was digui&longs;ed to
my&longs;elf; I con&longs;idered it merely as a more tender
&longs;pecies of friend&longs;hip, and cheri&longs;hed it without compunction.

Through my uncle's exertions a meeting was
brought about between Carwin and Pleyel, and
explanations took place which re&longs;tored me at once
to the good opinion of the latter. Though &longs;eparated
&longs;o widely our corre&longs;pondence was punctual and frequent,
and paved the way for that union which can
only end with the death of one of us.
In my letters to him I made no &longs;ecret of my former
&longs;entiments. This was a theme on which I
could talk without painful, though not without delicate
emotions. That knowledge which I &longs;hould
never have imparted to a lover, I &longs;elt little &longs;cruple
to communicate to a friend.
A year and an half elap&longs;ed when There&longs;a was
&longs;natched from him by death, in the hour in which
&longs;he gave him the fir&longs;t pledge of their mutual affection.
This event was borne by him with his customary
fortitude. It induced him, however, to
make a change in his plans. He di&longs;po&longs;ed of his
property in America, and joined my uncle and me,
who had terminated the wanderings of two years
at Montpellier, which will henceforth, I believe,
be our permanent abode.
If you reflect upon that entire confidence which
had &longs;ub&longs;i&longs;ted from our infancy between Pleyel and
my&longs;elf; on the pa&longs;&longs;ion that I had contracted, and




which was merely &longs;mothered for a time; and on
the e&longs;teem which was mutual, you will not, perhaps,
be &longs;urprized that the renovation of our intercourse
&longs;hould give birth to that union which at
pre&longs;ent &longs;ub&longs;i&longs;ts. When the period had elap&longs;ed necessary
to weaken the remembrance of There&longs;a,
to whom he had been bound by ties more of honor
than of love, he tendered his affections to me. I
need not add that the tender was eagerly accepted.
Perhaps you are &longs;omewhat intere&longs;ted in the fate
of Carwin. He &longs;aw, when too late, the danger
of impo&longs;ture. So much affected was he by the
cata&longs;trophe to which he was a witne&longs;s, that he laid
a&longs;ide all regard to his own &longs;afety. He fought my
uncle, and confided to him the tale which he had
ju&longs;t related to me. He found a more impartial
and indulgent auditor in Mr. Cambridge, who imputed
to maniacal illu&longs;ion the conduct of Wieland,
though he conceived the previous and un&longs;een agency
of Carwin, to have indirectly but powerfully predisposed
to this deplorable perver&longs;ion of mind.
It was ea&longs;y for Carwin to elude the per&longs;ecutions
of Ludloe. It was merely requi&longs;ite to hide himself
in a remote di&longs;trict of Penn&longs;ylvania. This,
when he parted from us, he determined to do. He
is now probably engaged in the harmle&longs;s pur&longs;uits of
agriculture, and may come to think, without insupportable
remor&longs;e, on the evils to which his fatal
talents have given birth. The innocence and usefulness
of his future life may, in &longs;ome degree, atone
for the mi&longs;eries &longs;o ra&longs;hly or &longs;o thoughtle&longs;&longs;ly inflicted.

More urgent con&longs;iderations hindered me from
mentioning, in the cour&longs;e of my former mournful
recital, any particulars re&longs;pecting the unfortunate
father of Loui&longs;a Conway. That man &longs;urely was




re&longs;erved to be a monument of capricious fortune.
His &longs;outhern journies being fini&longs;hed, he returned
to Philadelphia. Before he reached the city he left
the highway, and alighted at my brother's door.
Contrary to his expectation, no one came forth to
welcome him, or hail his approach. He attempted
to enter the hou&longs;e, but bolted doors, barred windows,
and a &longs;ilence broken only by unan&longs;wered
calls, &longs;hewed him that the man&longs;ion was de&longs;erted.
He proceeded thence to my habitation, which he
found, in like manner, gloomy and tenantle&longs;s. His
&longs;urprize may be ea&longs;ily conceived. The ru&longs;tics who
occupied the hut told him an imperfect and incredible
tale. He ha&longs;ted to the city, and extorted
from Mrs. Baynton a full di&longs;clo&longs;ure of late disasters.

He was inured to adver&longs;ity, and recovered, after
no long time, from the &longs;hocks produced by this
di&longs;appointment of his darling &longs;cheme. Our intercourse
did not terminate with his departure from
America. We have &longs;ince met with him in France,
and light has at length been thrown upon the mo&longs;
tives which occa&longs;ioned the di&longs;appearance of his wife,
in the manner which I formerly related to you.
I have dwelt upon the ardour of their conjugal
attachment, and mentioned that no &longs;u&longs;picion had
ever glanced upon her purity. This, though the
belief was long cheri&longs;hed, recent di&longs;coveries have
&longs;hewn to be que&longs;tionable. No doubt her integrity
would have &longs;urvived to the pre&longs;ent moment, if an
extraordinary fate had not befallen her.
Major Stuart had been engaged, while in Germany,
in a conte&longs;t of honor with an Aid de Camp
of the Marquis of Granby. His adver&longs;ary had
propagated a rumour injurious to his character. A
challenge was &longs;ent; a meeting en&longs;ued; and Stuart





wounded and di&longs;armed the calumniator. The offence
was atoned for, and his life &longs;ecured by suitable
conce&longs;&longs;ions.
Maxwell, that was his name, &longs;hortly after, in
con&longs;equence of &longs;ucceeding to a rich inheritance,
&longs;old his commi&longs;&longs;ion and returned to London. His
fortune was &longs;peedily augmented by an opulent marriage.
Intere&longs;t was his &longs;ole inducement to this
marriage, though the lady had been &longs;wayed by a
credulous affection. The true &longs;tate of his heart
was quickly di&longs;covered, and a &longs;eparation, by mutual
con&longs;ent, took place. The lady withdrew to
an e&longs;tate in a di&longs;tant county, and Maxwell continued
to con&longs;ume his time and fortune in the dissipation
of the capital.
Maxwell, though deceitful and &longs;en&longs;ual, po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;ed
great force of mind and &longs;pecious accompli&longs;hments.
He contrived to mi&longs;lead the generous mind of Stuart,
and to regain the e&longs;teem which his mi&longs;conduct,
for a time, had forfeited. He was recommended
by her hu&longs;band to the confidence of Mrs. Stuart.
Maxwell was &longs;timulated by revenge, and by a lawless
pa&longs;&longs;ion, to convert this confidence into a &longs;ource
of guilt.
The education and capacity of this woman, the
worth of her hu&longs;band, the pledge of their alliance
which time had produced, her maturity in age and
knowledge of the worldâ€”all combined to render
this attempt hopele&longs;s. Maxwell, however, was not
ea&longs;ily di&longs;couraged. The mo&longs;t perfect being, he
believed, mu&longs;t owe his exemption from vice to the
ab&longs;ence of temptation. The impul&longs;es of love are
&longs;o &longs;ubtile, and the influence of fal&longs;e rea&longs;oning, when
enforced by eloquence and pa&longs;&longs;ion, &longs;o unbounded,
that no human virtue is &longs;ecure from degeneracy.




All arts being tried, every temptation being summoned
to his aid, di&longs;&longs;imulation being carried to its
utmo&longs;t bound, Maxwell, at length, nearly accomplished
his purpo&longs;e. The lady's affections were
withdrawn from her hu&longs;band and transferred to him.
She could not, as yet, be reconciled to di&longs;honor.
All efforts to induce her to elope with him were ineffectual.
She permitted her&longs;elf to love, and to
avow her love; but at this limit the &longs;topped, and
was immoveable.
Hence this revolution in her &longs;entiments was productive
only of de&longs;pair. Her rectitude of principle
pre&longs;erved her from actual guilt, but could not restore
to her her ancient affection, or &longs;ave her from
being the prey of remor&longs;eful and impracticable
wi&longs;hes. Her hu&longs;band's ab&longs;ence produced a &longs;tate
of &longs;u&longs;pen&longs;e. This, however, approached to a period,
and &longs;he received tidings of his intended return.
Maxwell, being likewi&longs;e apprized of this event, and
having made a la&longs;t and un&longs;ucce&longs;sful effort to conquer
her reluctance to accompany him in a journey
to Italy, whither he pretended an invincible nece&longs;&longs;ity
of going, left her to pur&longs;ue the mea&longs;ures which
de&longs;pair might &longs;ugge&longs;t. At the &longs;ame time &longs;he received
a letter from the wife of Maxwell, unveiling
the true character of this man, and revealing facts
which the artifices of her &longs;educer had hitherto concealed
from her. Mrs. Maxwell had been prompted
to this di&longs;clo&longs;ure by a knowledge of her hu&longs;band's
practices, with which his own impetuo&longs;ity had made
her acquainted.
This di&longs;covery, joined to the delicacy of her scruples
and the angui&longs;h of remor&longs;e, induced her to
ab&longs;cond. This &longs;cheme was adopted in ha&longs;te, but
effected with con&longs;ummate prudence. She fled, on




the eve of her hu&longs;band's arrival, in the di&longs;gui&longs;e of a
boy, and embarked at Falmouth in a packet bound
for America.
The hi&longs;tory of her di&longs;a&longs;trous intercour&longs;e with
Maxwell, the motives inducing her to for&longs;ake her
country, and the mea&longs;ures &longs;he had taken to effect
her de&longs;ign, were related to Mrs. Maxwell, in reply
to her communication. Between the&longs;e women an
ancient intimacy and con&longs;iderable &longs;imilitude of character
&longs;ub&longs;i&longs;ted. This di&longs;clo&longs;ure was accompanied
with &longs;olemn injunctions of &longs;ecrecy, and the&longs;e injunctions
were, for a long time, faithfully ob&longs;erved.
Mrs. Maxwell's abode was &longs;ituated on the banks
of the Wey. Stuart was her kin&longs;man; their youth
had been &longs;pent together; and Maxwell was in
&longs;ome degree indebted to the man whom he betrayed,
for his alliance with this unfortunate lady.
Her e&longs;teem for the character of Stuart had never
been dimini&longs;hed. A meeting between them was
occa&longs;ioned by a tour which the latter had undertaken,
in the year after his return from America, to
Wales and the we&longs;tern countries. This interview
produced plea&longs;ure and regret in each. Their own
tran&longs;actions naturally became the topics of their
conver&longs;ation; and the untimely fate of his wife and
daughter were related by the gue&longs;t.
Mrs. Maxwell's regard for her friend, as well as
for the &longs;afety of her hu&longs;band, per&longs;uaded her to concealment;
but the former being dead, and the latter
being out of the kingdom, &longs;he ventured to produce
Mrs. Stuart's letter, and to communicate her own
knowledge of the treachery of Maxwell. She had
previou&longs;ly extorted from her gue&longs;t a promi&longs;e not to
pur&longs;ue any &longs;cheme of vengeance; but this promi&longs;e
was made while ignorant of the full extent of




Maxwell's depravity, and his pa&longs;&longs;ion refu&longs;ed to adhere
to it.
At this time my uncle and I re&longs;ided at Avignon.
Among the Engli&longs;h re&longs;ident there, and with whom
we maintained a &longs;ocial intercour&longs;e, was Maxwell.
This man's talents and addre&longs;s rendered him a favorite
both with my uncle and my&longs;elf. He had
even tendered me his hand in marriage; but this
being refu&longs;ed, he had &longs;ought and obtained permi&longs;&longs;ion
to continue with us the intercour&longs;e of friend&longs;hip.
Since a legal marriage was impo&longs;&longs;ible, no doubt,
his views were flagitious. Whether he had relinquished
the&longs;e views I was unable to judge.
He was one in a large circle at a villa in the environs,
to which I had likewi&longs;e been invited, when
Stuart abruptly entered the apartment. He was
recognized with genuine &longs;atisfaction by me, and
with &longs;eeming plea&longs;ure by Maxwell. In a &longs;hort
time, &longs;ome affair of moment being pleaded, which
required an immediate and exclu&longs;ive interview,
Maxwell and he withdrew together. Stuart and
my uncle had been known to each other in the
German army; and the purpo&longs;e contemplated by
the former in this long and ha&longs;ty journey, was confided
to his old friend.
A defiance was given and received, and the banks
of a rivulet, about a league from the city, was selected
as the &longs;cene of this conte&longs;t. My uncle, having
exerted him&longs;elf in vain to prevent an ho&longs;tile
meeting, con&longs;ented to attend them as a &longs;urgeon.â€”
Next morning, at &longs;un-ri&longs;e, was the time cho&longs;en.
I returned early in the evening to my lodgings.
Preliminaries being &longs;ettled between the combatants,
Stuart had con&longs;ented to &longs;pend the evening with us,
and did not retire till late. On the way to his hotel




he was expo&longs;ed to no mole&longs;tation, but ju&longs;t as he
&longs;tepped within the portico, a &longs;warthy and malignant
figure &longs;tarted from behind a column, and plunged a
&longs;tiletto into his body.
The author of this trea&longs;on could not certainly be
di&longs;covered; but the details communicated by Stuart,
re&longs;pecting the hi&longs;tory of Maxwell, naturally pointed
him out as an object of &longs;u&longs;picion. No one expressed
more concern, on account of this di&longs;a&longs;ter, than
he; and he pretended an ardent zeal to vindicate
his character from the a&longs;per&longs;ions that were ca&longs;t
upon it. Thenceforth, however, I denied my&longs;elf
to his vi&longs;its; and &longs;hortly after he di&longs;appeared from
this &longs;cene.
Few po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;ed more e&longs;timable qualities, and a
better title to happine&longs;s and the tranquil honors of
long life; than the mother and father of Loui&longs;a
Conway: yet they were cut off in the bloom of
their days; and their de&longs;tiny was thus accompli&longs;hed
by the &longs;ame hand. Maxwell was the in&longs;trument
of their de&longs;truction, though the in&longs;trument was applied
to this end in &longs;o different a manner.
I leave you to moralize on this tale. That virtue
&longs;hould become the victim of treachery is, no
doubt, a mournful con&longs;ideration; but it will not
e&longs;cape your notice, that the evils of which Carwin
and Maxwell were the authors, owed their
exi&longs;tence to the errors of the
&longs;ufferers. All efforts
would have been ineffectual to &longs;ubvert the
happine&longs;s or &longs;horten the exi&longs;tence of the Stuarts, if
their own frailty had not &longs;econded the&longs;e efforts. If
the lady had cru&longs;hed her di&longs;a&longs;trous pa&longs;&longs;ion in the
bud, and driven the &longs;educer from her pre&longs;ence, when
the tendency of his artifices was &longs;een; if Stuart
had not admitted the &longs;pirit of ab&longs;urd revenge, we








&longs;hould not have had to deplore this cata&longs;trophe. If
Wieland had framed ju&longs;ter notions of moral duty,
and of the divine attributes; or if I had been gifted
