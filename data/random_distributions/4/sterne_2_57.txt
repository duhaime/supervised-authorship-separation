In the case of knots,—by which, in
the first place, I would not be understood
to mean slip-knots,—because in
the course of my life and opinions,— 
my opinions concerning them will come
in more properly when I mention the catastrophe
of my great uncle Mr. Hammond
Shandy,—a little man,—but of
high fancy:—he rushed into the duke
of Monmouth's affair:—nor, secondly,
in this place, do I mean that particular
species of knots, called bow-knots;— 
there is so little address, or skill, or patience,
required in the unloosing them,
that they are below my giving any
opinion at all about them. —But by the
knots I am speaking of, may it please
your reverences to believe, that I mean 

good, honest, devilish tight, hard knots,
made bona fide, as Obadiah made his;— 
in which there is no quibbling provision
made by the duplication and return of
the two ends of the strings through the
annulus or noose made by the second
implication of them—to get them slipp'd
and undone by——I hope you apprehend
me. 
In the case of these knots then, and of
the several obstructions, which, may it
please your reverences, such knots cast
in our way in getting through life— 
every hasty man can whip out his penknife
and cut through them. —'Tis
wrong. Believe me, Sirs, the most virtuous
way, and which both reason and
conscience dictate—is to take our teeth
or our fingers to them. —Dr. Slop had
lost his teeth—his favourite instrument, 

by extracting in a wrong direction, or
by some misapplication of it, unfortunately
slipping, he had formerly in a
hard labour, knock'd out three of the
best of them, with the handle of it:— 
he tried his fingers—alas! the nails of
his fingers and thumbs were cut close. — 
The deuce take it! I can make nothing
of it either way, cried Dr. Slop. —The
trampling over head near my mother's
bed side increased. —Pox take the fellow! 
I shall never get the knots untied as long
as I live. —My mother gave a groan— 
Lend me your penknife—I must e'en cut
the knots at last– – – – –pugh!– – –psha!
– – –Lord! I have cut my thumb quite
across to the very bone—curse the fellow
—if there was not another man
midwife within fifty miles—I am undone
for this bout—I wish the scoundrel
hang'd—I wish he was shot—I wish 

all the devils in hell had him for a blockhead— 
My father had a great respect for Obadiah,
and could not bear to hear him
disposed of in such a manner—he had
moreover some little respect for himself
—and could as ill bear with the indignity
offer'd to himself in it. 
Had Dr. Slop cut any part about him,
but his thumb—my father had pass'd
it by—his prudence had triumphed:
as it was, he was determined to have his
revenge. 
Small curses, Dr. Slop, upon great occasions,
quoth my father, (condoling
with him first upon the accident) are but
so much waste of our strength and soul's
health to no manner of purpose. —I own 

it, replied Dr. Slop. —They are like
sparrow shot, quoth my uncle Toby, (suspending
his whistling) fired against a
bastion. —They serve, continued my
father, to stir the humours—but carry
off none of their acrimony:—for my own
part, I seldom swear or curse at all— 
I hold it bad—but if I fall into it, by
surprize, I generally retain so much presence
of mind (right, quoth my uncle
Toby) as to make it answer my purpose— 
that is, I swear on, till I find myself easy. 
A wise and a just man however would
always endeavour to proportion the vent
given to these humours, not only to the
degree of them stirring within himself— 
but to the size and ill intent of the offence
upon which they are to fall. — 
“Injuries come only from the heart,”—— 
quoth my uncle Toby. For this reason,
continued my father, with the most Cervantick 

gravity, I have the greatest veneration
in the world for that gentleman,
who, in distrust of his own discretion in
this point, sat down and composed (that
is at his leisure) fit forms of swearing
suitable to all cases, from the lowest to
the highest provocations which could
possibly happen to him,—which forms
being well consider'd by him, and such
moreover as he could stand to, he kept
them ever by him on the chimney piece,
within his reach, ready for use. —I never
apprehended, replied Dr. Slop, that
such a thing was ever thought of,—— 
much less executed. I beg your pardon
—answered my father; I was reading,
though not using, one of them to
my brother Toby this morning, whilst he
pour'd out the tea—'tis here upon the
shelf over my head;—but if I remember
right, 'tis too violent for a cut of the 

thumb. —Not at all, quoth Dr. Slop— 
the devil take the fellow. —Then answered
my father, 'Tis much at your service, Dr.
Slop—on condition you will read it
aloud;—so rising up and reaching
down a form of excommunication of the
church of Rome, a copy of which, my
father (who was curious in his collections)
had procured out of the leger-book
of the church of Rochester, writ by
Ernulphus the bishop—with a most
affected seriousness of look and voice,
which might have cajoled Ernulphus
himself,—he put it into Dr. Slop's hands. 
—Dr. Slop wrapt his thumb up in the
corner of his handkerchief, and with a
wry face, though without any suspicion,
read aloud, as follows,—my uncle Toby
whistling Lillabullero, as loud as he could,
all the time.

CAP. XXV.
EXCOMMUNICATIO.
Ex auctoritate Dei omnipotentis, Patris,
et Filij, et Spiritus Sancti, et
sanctorum canonum, sanctæque et intemeratæ 
Virginis Dei genetricis Mariæ, 
&line;
As the genuineness of the consultation of the Sorbonne
upon the question of baptism, was doubted
by some, and denied by others,—'twas thought
proper to print the original of this excommunication; 
for the copy of which Mr. Shandy returns
thanks to the chapter clerk of the dean and chapter
of Rochester. 

—Atque omnium cœlestium
virtutum, angelorum, archangelorum,
thronorum, dominationum, potestatuum,
cherubin ac seraphin, & sanctorum patriarchum,
prophetarum, & omnium apostolorum

innocentum, qui in conspectu Agni soli 

digni inventi sunt canticum cantare novum,
et sanctorum martyrum, et sanctorum
confessorum, et sanctarum virginum,
atque omnium simul sanctorum et
electorum Dei,—Excommunicamus, et
anathematizamus hunc [vel os] furem [fures], vel hunc [vel os]
malefactorem [malefactores], N. N. et a liminibus sanctæ 
Dei ecclesiæ sequestramus et æternis
suppliciis excruciandus [vel excruciandis], mancipetur [mancipentur], cum
Dathan et Abiram, et cum his qui dixerunt
Domino Deo, Recede à nobis, scientiam
viarum tuarum nolumus: et sicut
aquâ ignis extinguitur, sic extinguatur
lucerna ejus [vel. eorum] in secula seculorum nisi respuerit,
et ad satisfactionem venerit [venerint]. 
Amen. 

Maledicat illum [os] Deus Pater qui hominem

Maledicat illum [os] sancta Dei genetrix et
perpetua Virgo Maria. Maledicat illum [os]
sanctus Michael, animarum susceptor sacrarum. 
Maledicant illum [os] omnes angeli

Maledicat illum [os] patriarcharum et prophetarum
laudabilis numerus. Maledicat
illum [os] sanctus Johannes præcursor

discipuli, quatuor quoque evangelistæ,
qui sua prædicatione mundum universum
converterunt. Maledicat illum [os] cuneus
martyrum et confessorum mirificus, qui
Deo bonis operibus placitus inventus est. 
Maledicant illum [os] sacrarum virginum
chori, quæ mundi vana causa honoris
Christi respuenda contempserunt. Maledicant
illum [os] omnes sancti qui ab initio
mundi usque in finem seculi Deo dilecti
inveniuntur. 

Maledicant illum [os] cœli et terra, et omnia
sancta in eis manentia. 
Maledictus sit [sint] ubicunque fuerit [fuerint], sive
in domo, sive in agro, sive in viâ, sive in
semitâ, sive in silvâ, sive in aquâ, sive

Maledictus sit in totis compagibus

Maledicat illum Christus Filius Dei
vivi toto suæ majestatis imperio 



—et insurgat adversus illum cœlum
cum omnibus virtutibus quæ in eo moventur
ad damnandum eum, nisi penituerit
et ad satisfactionem venerit. Amen. 
Fiat, fiat. Amen.
