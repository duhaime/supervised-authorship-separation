The young stranger having been made acquainted, before her coming up stairs, of the rank and condition of the persons to whom she was about to be introduced, would not suffer herself to be any farther intreated by them, but began to satisfy the curiosity she had excited in these or the like words: 
“I am the daughter of a gentleman, said she, who by living in his youth above the income of his estate, has been reduced to live below the dignity of his birth, in order that his children may not, at his decease, have too much occasion to regret the situation in which they shall be left. 
“It is impossible for any parent to behave with greater tenderness and indulgence, or to be more sincerely 
anxious for the welfare of his posterity;—sensible of his former mistakes, he has often condescended to tell us, that he looks upon us as persons he has wrong'd, by having wasted what should have render'd comfortable the life he gave:—his affairs, however, are not on so ill a footing but that he supports his family in a genteel tho' not a grand manner; and if he lives a few years longer, it is hoped will be able to leave the estate to my brother, now a student at Cambridge, born to inherit, free from all incumbrance, except myself and a sister some years elder than either of us. 
“As for a provision for myself and sister, I have heard him say that his scheme is, as soon as my brother arrives at a proper age, to match him with some woman of fortune, which fortune should be equally divided between us two, and a settlement made for her out of the estate. 
“He never flatter'd himself with the expectations of any offers of marriage to our advantage; nor though he gave us all the accomplishments befitting our station in life, yet did he never encourage either of us to imagine that 
without money we had any thing in us capable of attracting a heart worthy our acceptance. 
“But to my great misfortune he found himself mistaken in this point;—a gentleman of a very large estate, happening to see me at a friend's house where I sometimes visited, took an extraordinary fancy to me; and after some necessary enquiries concerning my birth, character and circumstances, came to wait upon my father and ask'd his permission to make his addresses to me; adding at the same time, that he desir'd nothing but myself, and whatever fortune was intended for me might be given to my sister. 
“This last was a prevailing argument with my father, who, dear as I believe I then was to him, would perhaps have rather suffer'd me to lose so advantageous a match, than have confess'd his incapacity of giving me a portion. 
“But how fatal did this act of generosity in my lover prove to me;—my father, charmed with the proposal, hesitated not to comply with it, provided 
my consent might be obtain'd, which in his heart he resolved from that moment to compel me to grant, in case he should find me refractory to it. 
“It will doubtless seem a little strange to you, continued she, that I should mention as a misfortune what you might expect a girl in my precarious situation would have rejoiced at, and been elated with as the greatest good that could have befallen her;—the world I know condemns my folly,—I condemn myself,—yet was it as impossible for me to act otherwise, as it is to repent of what I have done. 
“You will perhaps imagine that he is some deformed and loathsome creature, but I assure you he is not; for I must do him the justice to acknowledge, that, making an allowance for his age, which by his own account is pretty near fifty, few men can boast of having a more agreeable person;—that he has also a good understanding,—a great deal of ready wit, and is very facetious in conversation;—but all this was insufficient to engage my affection, and I have a certain delicacy in my nature, if I may so call it, which will not permit me, on any consideration 
whatever, to give my hand where my heart will not go along with it. 
“The astonishment I felt on being first inform'd of the new conquest I had made, was succeeded by an adequate proportion of horror at being commanded by my father to receive that gentleman as the person ordain'd by Heaven and him to be my husband, and to look on such an alliance as the greatest blessing that could be bestow'd upon me. 
“I blush'd,—I trembled, and had not power to make the least reply, till being urged to speak, I recollected, as well as I was able, my scatter'd senses, and cried, though with a broken and faultering voice, that I was too young to think of marriage; to which my father sternly answer'd, —‘Be guided then by those who know how to think for you;’—and with these words left me to consider on what he had said. 
“The same day my lover dined with us, as I afterwards found, by the appointment of my father, who, as soon as the cloth was taken away, retired to his closet, pretending he had some letters to write, and left me to entertain 
this guest, or rather to be entertain'd by him with the declaration of his passion. 
“He made it, indeed, in the most respectful terms;—he told me, that having lost his wife in bringing a son into the world, he had resolved never to transfer the affection for her to any any other woman;—that he devoted near two and twenty years to her memory;—that during the whole time of his widowhood he had never seen that face till mine which had the power to alienate his thoughts from the grave where she lay buried;—but that he no sooner beheld me, than he felt new life and new desires rekindling in him;—remember'd that he was a man, born to enjoy the social delights of pure and virtuous love, and at the same time found it was with me alone he could partake them. 
“As this sort of conversation, and indeed every thing relating to love, was entirely new to me, I made but very aukward replies, and was so little able to express my real sentiments to him on that head, that I afterwards found he took what I said as the effects of simplicity 
and bashfulness, rather than any aversion either to him or his proposals. 
“My father, who poor man rejoiced in this opportunity of making my fortune, seem'd highly pleased with the account my lover gave him of my behaviour;—he told me I was a very good girl, and that he doubted not but that I should deserve the happiness Heaven was about to confer upon me:—‘but, said he, though the modesty with which I hear you received this first declaration was very becoming in a maid of your years; yet, as we have agreed the wedding shall be consummated in a few days, I would have you grow less reserved on every visit he makes you,—accustom yourself to treat him by degrees with more freedom, to the end that when you are made one, you may not be too much strangers to each other. 
“This so frighted me, that I could not forbear crying out with some vehemence, —‘Oh, sir! I conjure you not to talk in this manner,—I never can think of being married to him. 
“The look my father gave me at these words will always be imprinted 
on my memory. —‘Never think of being married to him! said he, then never think I am your father;—think rather of being an utter alien,—an outcast from my name and family;—think of begging,—starving,—of infamy, contempt and wretchedness. 
“These cruel expressions coming from the mouth of a parent, who till now had always used me with the extremest tenderness, cut me to the very soul;—I threw myself at his feet,—I wept,—I beseech'd him to moderate his passion, and protested, as I might do with the greatest sincerity, that the thoughts of offending him was more terrible to me than those of death itself. 
“He appear'd somewhat mollify'd with these submissions;—‘Child, said he, raising me from the posture I was in,—you cannot be so ignorant as not to know what I do in this affair is wholly for your happiness; though, indeed, whenever Heaven is pleased to call me hence, it would be an infinite satisfaction to me in my dying moments that I left one of my daughters independent. —I could wish, added he, looking towards my sister who sat 
at work in the room, that she had an offer equally advantageous. 
“If I had, sir, reply'd she pertly, I should scarce be so mad or silly as to run the risque of disobliging, you and at the same time of ruining myself by refusing it.” 
The beautiful stranger was in this part of her little history when she found herself oblig'd to break off by seeing dinner brought upon the table;—she would have withdrawn till the company should be more at leisure; but they insisted, in the most strenuous terms, that she would be their guest; to which, after making some few apologies, she consented.
