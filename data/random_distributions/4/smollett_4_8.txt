I make great progress in my studies—am
caressed by every body—my female cousins
take notice of me—I reject their invitation
—they are incensed and conspire
against me—I am left destitute by a misfortune
that befals my uncle—Gawky's
treachery—my revenge. 
As I was now capable of reflection, I began
to consider my precarious situation; that I
was utterly abandoned by those whose duty it
was to protect me; and that my sole dependance
was on the generosity of one man, who was
not only exposed by his profession, to continual
dangers, which might one day deprive me of him
for ever; but also (no doubt) subject to those
vicissitudes of disposition, which a change of fortune
usually creates; or, which a better acquaintance
with the world might produce:—for I always
ascribed his benevolence to the dictates of a
heart as yet undebauched by a commerce with
mankind. —Alarmed at these considerations, I resolved
to apply myself with great care to my
studies, and enjoy the opportunity in my power: 
This I did with such success, that in the space of
three years, I understood Greek very well, was
pretty far advanced in the mathematics, and no
stranger to moral and natural philosophy: logick
I made no account of; but above all things, I
valued myself on my taste in the Belle Lettre, 

and a talent for poetry, which had already produced
some morceaus, that brought me a great
deal of reputation. These qualifications added to
a good face and shape, acquired the esteem and
acquaintance of the most considerable people in
town, and I had the satisfaction to find myself in
some degree of favour with the ladies; an intoxicating
piece of good fortune, to one of my amorous
complexion! which I obtained, or at
least preserved, by gratifying their propensity to
scandal, in lampooning their rivals. —Two of
my female cousins lived in this place, with their
mother, after the death of their father, who left
his whole fortune (which was considerable) equally
divided between them; so that if they were
not the most beautiful, they were at least the richest
toasts in town; and received daily the addresses of
all the beaux and cavaliers of the country. — 
Although I had hitherto been looked upon
by them with the most supercilious contempt,
which I endeavoured to return by the most perfect
neglect, my character now attracted their
notice so much, that I was given to understand,
I might be honoured with their acquaintance, if
I pleased. —The reader will easily perceive, that
this condescension either flowed from the hope of
making my poetical capacity subservient to their
malice, or at least of screening themselves from
the lash of my resentment, which they effectually
provoked. —I enjoyed this triumph with great
rapture; and not only rejected their offer with
disdain, but, in all my performances, whether satire
or panegyric, industriously avoided mentioning
their names, even while I celebrated those of
their intimates, which mortified their pride exceedingly,
and incensed them to such a degree, 

that they rendered themselves universally ridiculous
in satisfying their resentment against me. 
—The first stroke of their revenge consisted in
their hiring a poor collegian to write verses against
me, the subject of which was my own poverty,
and the catastrophe of my unhappy parents; 
but besides the badness of the composition (of
which they themselves were ashamed) they did not
find their account in endeavouring to reproach
me with those misfortunes, which they and their
relations had intailed upon me; and which consequently,
reflected much more dishonour on themselves,
than on me, who was the innocent victim
of their barbarity and avarice. —Finding this plan
miscarry, they found means to irritate a young
gentleman against me, by telling him I had lampooned
his mistress; and so effectually succeeded
in the quality of incendiaries, that this enraged lover
determined to seize me next night, as I returned
to my lodgings from a friend's house that I frequented; 
with this view, he waited in the street,
attended by two of his companions, to whom he
had imparted his design of carrying me down to
the river, in which he proposed to have me heartily
ducked, notwithstanding the severity of the
weather, it being then about the middle of December. 
—But this stratagem did not succeed; 
for, being apprised of their ambush, I got home
another way, and by the help of my landlord's
apprentice, emptied a close stool out of the garret
window, which did great execution upon
them; and next day, occasioned so much mirth
at their expence, that they found themselves under
a necessity of leaving the town, until the adventure
should be entirely forgotten. —My
cousins (though twice baffled in their expectation) 

did not however, desist from persecuting me,
who had now enraged them beyond a possibility
of forgiveness, by detecting their malice, and
preventing its effects: neither would I have
found them more humane, had I patiently submitted
to their rancour, and bore without murmuring
the rigour of their unreasonable hate; for, I have
found by experience, that though small favours
may be acknowledged, and slight injuries atoned,
there is no wretch so ungrateful as he, whom
you have most generously obliged; and no enemy
so implacable, as those who have done you
most wrong. —These good-natured creatures,
therefore, had recourse to a scheme which conspired
with a piece of bad news I soon after received,
to give them all the satisfaction they desired:
this plan was to debauch the faith of my
companion and confident, and prevail on him to
betray the trust I reposed in him, by imparting
to them the particulars of my small amours,
which they published with such exaggerations,
that I suffered very much in the opinion of every
body, and was utterly discarded, by the dear
creatures whose names had been called in question. 
—While I was busied in tracing out the author
of this treachery, that I might not only be revenged
on him, but also vindicate my character to
my friends; I one day, perceived the looks of
my landlady so altered, when I went home to
dinner, that upon enquiring into the cause, she
screwed up her mouth, and fixing her eyes on
the ground, told me her husband had received a
letter from Mr. Bowling, with one inclosed for
me—she was very sorry for what had happened,
both for my sake, and his own—People
should be more cautious of their conduct—she 

was always afraid his brutal behaviour would
bring him into some misfortune or other. —As for
her part, she would be very ready to befriend me; 
but she had a small family of her own to maintain. 
—The world would do nothing for her if she should
come to want—charity begins at home. —She wished
I had been bound to some substantial handicraft,
such as a weaver or shoemaker, rather than loiter
away my time in learning foolish nonsense that
would never bring me in a penny—but some
folks are wise, and some are otherwise. —I was
listening to this mysterious discourse, with great
amazement, when her husband entered, and
without speaking a syllable, put both the letters
into my hand. —I received them trembling, and
read what follows: 

To Roger Potion.
SIR,
“This is to let you know that I have quitted
the Thunder man of war; being obliged
to sheer off, for killing my captain,
which I did fairly on the beach, at Cape Tiberoon,
in the island of Hispaniola; having
received his fire, and returned it, which went
through his body.—and I would serve the best
man so that ever stept between stem and stern,
if so be that he struck me, as captain Oakhum,
did. I
am (thank God) safe among the French,
who are very civil, thof I don't understand
their lingo,—and I hope to be restored
in a little time, for all the great friends and
parliamentary interest of the captain, for I have
sent home to my landlord in Deal, an account 

of the whole affair, with our bearings and
distances while we were engaged, whereby I
have desired him to lay it before his majesty,
who (G—d bless him) will not suffer an honest
tar to be wronged. —My love to your
spouse, and am 
“Your loving friend,
and servant to command,
while
Thomas Bowling.” 

To Roderick Random.
Dear Rory,
“Don't be grieved at my misfortune— 
but mind your book, my lad. I have
got no money to send you; but what of that? 
—Mr. Potion will take care of you, for the
love he bears to me; and let you want for nothing,
and it shall go hard, but I will see him
one day repaid. —No more at present, but
rests 
“Your dutiful uncle
and servant, till death,
Thomas Bowling.” 
This letter (which with the other was dated
from Port Louis in Hispaniola) was no sooner
read, than the apothecary shaking his head, began: 
—“I have a very great regard for Mr. 

Bowling, that's certain,—and could be well
content—but times are very hard. —There's
no such thing as money to be got—I believe 'tis
all vanished under-ground, for my part. —Besides,
I have been out of pocket already, having
entertained you since the beginning of this
month, without receiving a six-pence,—and
G&sblank;d knows if ever I shall;—for I believe it
will go hard with your uncle. —And more
than that, I was thinking of giving you warning,
for I want your apartment for a new
'prentice, whom I expect from the country
every hour. —So, desire you will this week
provide yourself with another lodging.” — 
The indignation which this harangue inspired,
gave me spirits to support my reverse of fortune; 
and to tell him, I despised his mean, selfish disposition
so much, that I would rather starve than
be beholden to him for one single meal. Upon
which, out of my pocket-money, I paid him to
the last farthing of what I owed, and assured
him, I would not sleep another night under his
roof. —This said, I sallied out, in a transport of
rage and sorrow, without knowing whither to
fly for shelter, having not one friend in the
world capable of relieving me, and only three
shillings in my purse. —After giving way for a few
minutes to the dictates of my rage, I went and
hired a small bed-room at the rate of one shilling
and six-pence per week, which I was obliged to
pay per-advance, before the landlord would receive
me; hither I removed my luggage; and
next morning got up, with a view of craving the
advice and assistance of a person who had on all
occasions, loaded me with caresses, and made
frequent offers of friendship, while I was under 

no necessity of accepting them. —He received me
with his wonted affability, and insisted on my
breakfasting with him, which I did not think fit
to refuse. —But when I communicated the occasion
of my visit, he appeared so disconcerted,
that I concluded him wonderfully affected with
the misery of my condition, and looked upon him
as a man of the most extensive sympathy and benevolence. 
—He did no leave me long under this
mistake; for recovering himself out of his confusion,
he told me, he was grieved at my misfortune,
and desired to know what had passed between
my landlord Mr Potion and me. Whereupon
I recounted the conversation; and when I
repeated the answer I made to his ungenerous remonstrance
with regard to my leaving his house,
this pretended friend affected a stare, and exclaimed,
“Is it possible you could behave so ill
to the man who had treated you so kindly all
along?” —My surprise at hearing this, was
not at all affected, whatever his might be; and
I gave him to understand, with some warmth,
that I did not imagine he would so unreasonably
espouse the cause of a scoundrel, who ought to be
expelled from every social community. —This
heat of mine, gave him all the advantage he desired
over me, and our discourse (after much altercation)
concluded in his desiring never to see
me again in that place; to which I yielded my
consent, assuring him, that had I been as well
acquainted with his principles formerly as I was
now, he never should have had an opportunity to
make that request. —And thus we parted. 
On my return, I met my old comrade 'squire
Gawky, whom his father had sent, some time
ago, to town, for his improvement in writing, 

dancing, fencing; and to see the world. As I
had lived with him, since his arrival, on the footing
of our old intimacy, I made no scruple of informing
him of the lowness of my circumstances,
and asking a small supply of money, to answer
my present expence; upon which he pulled out
an handful of half-pence with a shilling or two
among them, and swore that was all he had to
keep his pocket till next quarter day; having
lost the greatest part of his allowance the night
before at billiards. Though this might very well
be true, I was extremely mortified at his indifference; 
for he neither discovered any sympathy
for my mishap, nor desire of alleviating my distress; 
and accordingly, I left him without uttering
one word: But when I afterwards understood,
that he was the person who had formerly
betrayed me to the malice of my cousins, to
whom likewise he had carried the tidings of my
forlorn situation, which afforded them great matter
of triumph and exultation, I determined
with myself to call him to a severe account; for
which purpose, I borrowed a sword, and wrote a
challenge, desiring him to meet me at a certain
time and place, that I might have an opportunity
of punishing his perfidy, at the expence of his
blood. —He accepted the invitation, and I betook
myself to the field, though not without feeling
considerable repugnance to the combat, which
frequently attacked me in cold sweats by the
way;—but the desire of revenge, the shame of
retracting, and hope of conquest, conspired to
repel these unmanly symptoms of fear; and I
appeared on the plain with a good grace: there I
waited an hour beyond the time appointed, and
was not ill pleased to find he had no mind to 

meet me; because now I should have an opportunity
of exposing his cowardice, displaying my
own courage, and of beating him soundly wheresoever
I should find him, without any dread of
the consequence. —Elevated with these suggestions,
which entirely banished all thoughts of my
deplorable condition, I went directly to Gawky's
lodgings, where I was informed of his precipitate
retreat, he having set out for the country in less
than an hour after he had received my billet. — 
Whereupon, I was vain enough to have the
whole story inserted in the news, although I was
fain to sell a gold-laced hat to my landlord, for
less than half-price, to defray the expence, and
contribute to my subsistence.
