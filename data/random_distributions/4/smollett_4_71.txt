I visit my old friend Thomson—we
set sail for Europe, meet with an odd adventure
—arrive in England—I ride
across the country from Portsmouth to
Sussex—converse with Mrs. Sagely,
who informs me of Narcissa's being in London
—in consequence of this intelligence, I
proceed to Canterbury—meet with my old
friend Morgan—arrive at London— 
visit Narcissa—introduce my father to
her—he is charmed with her good sense and
beauty—we come to a determination of
demanding her brother's consent to our marriage. 
I enquired, as soon as I got ashore, about my
generous companion Mr. Thomson; and hearing
that he lived in a flourishing condition, upon
the estate left to him by his wife's father, who
had been dead some years, I took horse immediately,
with the consent of Don Rodriguez, who
had heard me mention him with great regard, 

and in a few hours reached the place of his habitation. 
I should much wrong the delicacy of Mr.
Thomson's sentiments, to say barely he was glad
to see me: He felt all that the most sensible and
disinterested friendship could feel on this occasion,
introduced me to his wife, a very amiable young
lady, who had already blessed him with two fine
children; and being as yet ignorant of my circumstances,
frankly offered me the assistance of
his purse and interest. I thanked him for his generous
intention, and made him acquainted with
my situation, on which he congratulated me with
great joy, and after I had staid with him a whole
day and night, accompanied me back to Kingston,
to wait upon my father, whom he invited to
his house: Don Rodriguez complied with his request,
and having been handsomely entertained
during the space of a week, returned extremely
well satisfied with the behaviour of my friend
and his lady, to whom at parting, he presented a
valuable diamond ring, as a token of his esteem. 
During the course of my conversation with Mr.
Thomson, he let me know, that his and my old commander
captain Oakhum was dead some months,
and that immediately after his death, a discovery
had been made of some valuable effects that he
had feloniously secreted out of a prize, by the
assistance of Dr. Mackshane, who was now actually
in prison on that account, and being destitute
of friends, subsisted solely on the charity
of my friend, whose bounty he had implored
in the most abject manner, after having been the
barbarous occasion of driving him to that terrible
extremity on board of the Thunder, which we 

have formerly related. —Whatsoever this wretch
might have been guilty of, I applauded Mr.
Thomson's generosity towards him in his distress,
which wrought so much upon me also, that I sent
him ten pistoles, in such a private manner, that
he could never know his benefactor. 
While my father and I were caressed among the
gentlemen on shore, captain Bowling had wrote
to his owners, by the packet, which sailed a few
days after our arrival, signifying his prosperous
voyage hitherto, and desiring them to ensure his
ship and cargo homeward bound after which he
applied himself so heartily to the loading his ship,
that with the assistance of Mr. Thomson, she
was full in less than six weeks. This kind gentleman
likewise procured for Don Rodriguez,
bills upon London for the greatest part of his
gold and silver, by which means it was secured
against the risk of the seas and the enemy; and
before we sailed, supplied us with such large
quantities of all kinds of stock, that not only
we, but the whole ships company, fared sumptuously
during the voyage. 
Every thing being ready, we took our leave
of our kind entertainers, and going on board at
Port Royal, set sail for England on the first day
of June. —We beat up to windward, with fine
easy weather; and one night, believing ourselves
near Cape Tiberoon, lay to, with an intention
to wood and water next morning in the bay: 
While we remained in this situation, a sailor having
drank more new rum than he could carry,
staggered over-board, and notwithstanding all the
means that could be used to preserve him, went
to the bottom and disappeared. About two hours 

after this melancholy accident happened, as I enjoyed
a cool air on the quarter-deck, I heard a
voice rising, as it were, out of the sea, and calling,
“Ho, the ship, a hoy!” Upon which
one of the men upon the forecastle cried, “I'll
be d&wblank;n'd, if that an't Jack Marlinspike,
who went over-board!” Not a little surprized
at this event, I jumped into the boat that
lay along-side, with the second mate and four
men, and rowing towards the place, from whence
the voice (which repeated the hail) seemed to
proceed, we perceived something floating upon
the water; when we had rowed a little farther,
we discerned it to be a man riding upon a hencoop,
who seeing us approach, pronounced with
a hoarse voice, “D&wblank;n your bloods! why did
you not answer when I hailed?” Our mate,
who was a veritable seaman, hearing this salute,
said, “By G&wblank;d, my lads, this is none of our
man—This is the devil—pull away for the
ship.” The fellows obeyed his command,
without question, and were already some fathoms
on our return, when I insisted on their taking up
the poor creature, and prevailed upon them to
go back to the wreck, which when we came
near the second time, and signified our intention,
we received an answer of, “Avast, avast—what
ship, brother?” Being satisfied in this particular,
he cried, “D&wblank;n the ship, I was in
hopes it had been my own—where are you
bound?” We gratified his curiosity in this
too; upon which he suffered himself to be taken
on board, and after being comforted with
a dram, told us, he belonged to the Vesuvio man
of war, upon a cruize off the island of Hispaniola; 

that he had fallen over-board about four
and twenty hours ago, and the ship being under
sail, they did not chuse to bring to, but tossed
a hen-coop over-board for his convenience, upon
which he was in good hopes of reaching the Cape
next morning; howsomever, he was as well
content to be aboard us, because he did not doubt
that we should meet his ship; and if he had
gone ashore in the bay, he might have been taken
prisoner by the French. —My uncle and father
were very much diverted with the account of this
fellow's unconcerned behaviour; and in two days,
meeting with the Vesuvio, as he expected, he was
sent him on board of her according to his
desire. 
Having beat up successfully the windward
passage, we stretched to the northward, and falling
in with a westerly wind, in eight weeks arrived
in soundings, and in two days after made
the Lizzard. —It is impossible to express the joy
I felt at sight of English ground! Don Rodriguez
was not unmoved, and Strap shed tears of
gladness. —The sailors profited by our satisfaction; 
the shoe that was nailed to the mast, being quite
filled with our liberality. —My uncle resolved to
run up into the Downs at once, but the wind
shifting when we were a-breast of the isle of
Wight, he was obliged to turn in to St. Helens,
and come to an anchor at Spithead, to the great
mortification of the crew, thirty of whom were
immediately pressed on board of a man of war. 
My father and I went a shore immediately to
Portsmouth, leaving Strap with the captain to go
round with the ship and take care of our effects; 
and I discovered so much impatience to see my 

charming Narcissa, that my father permitted me
to ride across the country to her brother's house; 
while he should hire a post-chaise for London,
where he would wait for me at a place to which
I directed him. 
Fired with all the eagerness of passion, I took
post that very night, and in the morning reached
an inn, about three miles from the Squire's habitation; 
here I remained till next evening, allaying
the torture of my impatience with the
rapturous hope of seeing that divine creature,
after an absence of eighteen months, which so far
from impairing, had raised my love to the most
exalted pitch! Neither were my reflections free
from apprehension, that sometimes intervened
in spite of all my hope, and represented her as
having yielded to the importunity of her brother,
and blessed the arms of an unhappy rival— 
My thoughts were even maddened with the
fear of her death; and when I arrived in the
dark at the house of Mrs. Sagely, I had not
for some time courage to desire admittance,
lest my soul should be shocked with dismal tidings. 
At length, however, I knocked, and no sooner
certified the good gentlewoman of my voice than
she opened the door, and received me with a
most affectionate embrace, that brought tears into
her aged eyes: “For heaven's sake! dear mother
(cried I) tell me, how is Narcissa? is
she the same that I left her?” She blessed
my ears with saying, “She is as beautiful, in as
good health, and as much yours as ever.” — 
Transported at this assurance, I begged to know
if I could not see her that very night when this
sage matron gave me to understand that my 

mistress was in London, and that things were
strangely altered in the Squire's house since my
departure; that he had been married a whole
year to Melinda, who at first found means to
wean his attention so much from Narcissa, that
he became quite careless of that lovely sister, comforting
himself with the clause in his father's will,
by which she would forfeit her fortune, if she
should marry without his consent;—that my
mistress being but indifferently treated by her
sister-in-law, had made use of her freedom some
months ago, and gone to town, where she was
lodged with Miss Williams, in expectation of
my arrival; and had been pestered with the addresses
of Lord Quiverwit, who finding her heart
engaged, had fallen upon a great many shifts, to
perswade her that I was dead: but finding all his
artifices unsuccessful, and despairing of gaining her
affection, he had consoled himself for her indifference,
by marrying another lady some weeks ago,
who had already left him on account of some family
uneasiness. —Besides this interesting information,
she told me, that there was not a great deal of
harmony between Melinda and the Squire, who
was so much disgusted at the number of gallants
who continued to hover about her even after
marriage, that he hurried her down into the
country much against her inclination, where
their mutual animosities had risen to such a
height, that they preserved no decency before
company or servants, but abused one another in
the grossest terms. 
This good old gentlewoman, to give me a
convincing proof of my dear Narcissa's unalterable
love, gratified me with a sight of the last 

letter she had favoured her with, in which I was
mentioned with so much honour, tenderness and
concern, that my soul was fired with impatience,
and I determined to ride all night, that I might
have it the sooner in my power to make her
happy. —Mrs. Sagely perceiving my eagerness,
and her maternal affection being equally divided
between Narcissa and me, begged leave to remind
me of the sentiments with which I went abroad,
that would not permit me for any selfish gratification
to prejudice the fortune of that amiable
young lady, who must entirely depend upon me,
after having bestowed herself in marriage. I
thanked her for her kind concern, and as briefly
as possible described my flourishing situation, which
afforded this humane person infinite wonder and
satisfaction. I told her, that now I had an opportunity
to manifest my gratitude for the obligations
I owed, I would endeavour to make her
old age comfortable and easy; as a step to
which, I proposed she should come and live
with Narcissa and me. —This venerable gentlewoman
was so much affected with my words,
that the tears run down her ancient cheeks; 
she thanked heaven that I had not belied the
presages she had made, on her first acquaintance
with me; acknowledging my generosity, as she
called it, in the most elegant and pathetick expressions; 
but declined my proposal, on account
of her attachment to the dear melancholy cottage
where she had so peacefully consumed her
solitary widowhood. Finding her immoveable on
this subject, I insisted on her accepting a present
of thirty guineas, and took my leave, resolving
to accommodate her with the same sum annually, 

for the more comfortable support of the infirmities
of age. 
Having rode all night, I found myself at Canterbury
in the morning, where I alighted to procure
fresh horses; and as I walked into the inn,
perceived an apothecary's shop on the other side
of the street, with the name of Morgan over the
door: Alarm'd at this discovery, I could not help
thinking that my old mess-mate had settled in this
place; and upon enquiry, found my conjecture
true, and that he was married lately to a widow
of that city, by whom he had got three thousand
pounds. Rejoiced at this intelligence, I
went to his shop as soon as it was open, and
found my friend behind the counter, busy in
preparing a glyster. I saluted him at entrance,
with “Your servant, Mr. Morgan.” —Upon
which he looked at me, and replying, “Your
most humble servant, goot Sir” rubbed his
ingredients in the mortar, without any emotion. 
“What! (said I) Morgan, have you forgot
your old mess-mate?” At these words, he
looked up again, and starting, cried, “As Got
is my—sure it cannot—yes by my salfation, I
pelieve it is my tear frient Mr. Rantom.” — 
He was no sooner convinced of my identity, than
he threw down the pestle, overset the mortar,
and jumping over the board, swept up the contents
with his cloaths, flew about my neck,
hugged me affectionately, and daubed me all
over with turpentine and the yolks of eggs, which
he had been mixing when I came in. —Our
mutual congratulations being over, he told me,
that he found himself a widower upon his return
from the West Indies that he had got interest 

to be appointed surgeon of a man of war, in
which capacity he had served some years, until he
married an apothecary's widow, with whom he
now enjoyed a pretty good sum of money, peace
and quiet, and an indifferent good trade. —He
was very desirous of hearing my adventures, which
I assured him I had not time to relate, but told
him in general, my circumstances were very good,
and that I hoped to see him when I should not
be in such a hurry as at present. —He insisted
however on my staying breakfast, and introduced
me to his wife, who seemed to be a decent sensible
woman, pretty well stricken in years. In
the course of our conversation, he shewed the
sleeve-buttons I had exchanged with him at our
parting in the West Indies, and was not a little
proud to see that I had preserved his with the
same care. When I informed him of Mackshane's
condition, he seem'd at first to exult over his
distress; but after a little recollection, he said,
“Well, he has paid for his malice, I forgife
him, and may Got forgife him likewise.” He
expressed great concern for the soul of captain
Oakhum, which he believed was now gnashing
its teeth: but it was some time before I could
convince him of Thomson's being alive, at whose
good fortune nevertheless he was extremely
glad. 
Having renewed our protestations of friendship,
I bid the honest Welchman and his spouse farewell,
and taking post horses, arrived at London
that same night, where I found my father in good
health, to whom I imparted what I had learned
of Narcissa. —This indulgent parent approved of
my intention of marrying her, even without a 

fortune, provided her brother's consent could not
be obtained; promised to make over to me in a
few days a sufficiency to maintain her in a fashionable
manner, and expressed a desire of seeing
this amiable creature, who had captivated me so
much. —As I had not slept the night before, and
was besides fatigued with my journey, I found
myself under a necessity of taking some repose,
and went to bed accordingly: next morning about
ten a-clock, I took a chair, and, according to
Mrs. Sagely's directions, went to my charmer's
lodgings, and enquired for Miss Williams. —I had
not waited in a parlour longer than a minute,
when this young woman entered, and no sooner
perceived me, than she shrieked and run backward; 
I got between her and the door, and
clasping her in my arms, brought her to herself
by an embrace. “Good heaven (cried she) Mr.
Random is it you indeed! my mistress will
run distracted with joy.” —I told her, it was
from an apprehension that my sudden appearance
would have some bad effect on my dear Narcissa,
that I had desired to see her first, in order
to concert some method of acquainting her mistress
gradually with my arrival. She approved of my
conduct, and after having yielded to the suggestions
of her own friendship, in asking if my voyage
had been successful, charged herself with that
office, and left me glowing with desire of seeing
and embracing the object of my love. In a very
little time I heard some body coming down stairs
in haste, and the voice of my angel pronounce,
with an eager tone, “O heaven! is it possible!
where is he?” How were my faculties
arroused at this well-known found! and how was 

my soul transported, when she broke in upon my
view, in all the bloom of ripened beauty! Grace
was in all her steps, heaven in her eye, in every
gesture dignity and love! —You whose souls are
susceptible of the most delicate impressions, whose
tender bosoms have felt the affecting vicissitudes
of love, who have suffered an absence of eighteen
long months from the dear object of your hope,
and found at your return the melting fair, as
kind and constant as your heart could wish; do
me justice on this occasion, and conceive what
unutterable rapture possessed us both, while we
flew into one anothers arms! This was no time
for speech,—locked in a mutual embrace, we
continued some minutes in a silent trance of joy! 
—When I thus encircled all that my soul held
dear,—while I hung over her beauties,—beheld
her eyes sparkle, and every feature flush with
virtuous fondness; when I saw her enchanting
bosom heave with undissembled rapture, and
knew myself the happy cause—Heavens! what
was my situation! —I am tempted to commit my
paper to the flames, and to renounce my pen for
ever, because its most ardent and lucky expression
so poorly describes the emotions of my soul. 
O adorable Narcissa! (cried I) O miracle of
beauty, love and truth! I at last fold thee in my
arms! I at last can call thee mine! no jealous
brother shall thwart our happiness again; fortune
hath at length recompenced me for all my sufferings,
and enabled me to do justice to my love. 
—The dear creature smiled ineffably charming,
and with a look of bewitching tenderness, said,
“And shall we never part again?” “Never! (I
replied) thou wondrous pattern of all earthly 

perfection! never, until death shall divide us!
by this ambrosial kiss, a thousand times more
fragrant than the breeze that sweeps the orange
grove, I never more will leave thee!” 
As my first transport abated, my passion grew
turbulent and unruly. I was giddy with standing
on the brink of bliss, and all my virtue and philosophy
were scarce sufficient to restrain the inordinate
sallies of desire. —Narcissa perceived the
conflict within me, and with her usual dignity of
prudence, called off my imagination from the object
in view, and with eager expressions of interested
curiosity, desired to know the particulars
of my voyage. —In this I gratified her inclination,
bringing my story down to the present hour. 
She was infinitely surprised at the circumstances
of my finding my father, which brought tears
into her lovely eyes. She was transported at hearing
that he approved my flame, discovered a
longing desire of being introduced to him, congratulated
herself and me upon my good fortune,
and observed that this great and unexpected stroke
of fate seemed to have been brought about by the
immediate direction of providence. —Having entertained
ourselves some hours with the genuine
effusions of our souls, I obtained her consent to
compleat my happiness as soon as my father should
judge it proper; and applying with my own
hands a valuable necklace, composed of diamonds
and amethysts set alternately, which an old Spanish
lady at Paraguay presented me with, I took
my leave, promising to return in the afternoon
with Don Rodriguez. —When I went home, this
generous parent enquired very affectionately about
the health of my dear Narcissa, to whom that 

I might be the more agreeable, he put into my
hand a deed, by which I found myself in possession
of fifteen thousand pounds, exclusive of
the profits of my own merchandize, which amounted
to three thousand more. —After dinner
I accompanied him to the lodging of my mistress,
who being dressed for the occasion, made a most
dazzling appearance. I could perceive him struck
with her figure, which I really think was the
most beautiful that ever was created under the
sun. He embraced her tenderly, and told her,
he was proud of having a son who had spirit to
attempt, and qualifications to engage, the affections
of such a fine lady. —She blushed at this compliment,
and with eyes full of the softest languishment
turned upon me, said, she would have been
unworthy of Mr. Random's attention, had she
been blind to his extraordinary merit. —I made
no other answer than a low bow. My father sighing,
pronounced, “Such once was my Charlotte!” 
while the tear rushed into his eye, and the tender
heart of Narcissa manifested itself in two precious
drops of sympathy, which, but for his presence,
I would have kissed away. Without repeating
the particulars of our conversation, I shall only
observe, that Don Rodriguez was as much charmed
with her good-sense, as with her appearance; 
and she was no less pleased with his understanding
and polite address. —It was determined that he
should write to the Squire signifying his approbation
of my passion for his sister, and offering a
settlement which he should have no reason to reject; 
and that, if he should refuse the proposal,
we would crown our mutual wishes without any
farther regard to his will.
