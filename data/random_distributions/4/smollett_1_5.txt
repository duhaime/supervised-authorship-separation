His mother's prowess and death; together with
some instances of his own sagacity. 
It would have been impossible for the mother
of our adventurer, such as she hath
been described, to sit quietly in her tent, while
such an heroic scene was acting. She was no
sooner apprised of the general's intention, to
attack the enemy, than she, as usual, packed
up her moveables in a waggon, which she committed
to the care of a peasant in the neighbourhood,
and put herself in motion with the troops; 
big with the expectation of re-acting that part,
in which she had formerly acquitted herself so 

much to her advantage. Nay, she by this
time looked upon her own presence as a certain
omen of success to the cause which she espoused:
and in their march to battle, actually encouraged
the ranks with repeated declarations,
importing, that she had been eye witness of
ten decisive engagements, in all which her
friends had been victorious, and imputing such
uncommon good fortune to some supernatural
quality inherent in her person. 
Whether or not this confidence contributed
to the fortune of the day, by inspiriting the
soldiers to an uncommon pitch of courage
and resolution, I shall not pretend to determine; 
but certain it is, the victory began
from that quarter in which she had posted
herself; and no corps in the army behaved
with such intrepidity as that, which was manifested
by those who were favoured with her
admonitions and example; for, she not only
exposed her person to the enemy's fire with
the indifference and deliberation of a veteran,
but she is said to have atchieved a very conspicuous
exploit by the prowess of her single
arm: the extremity of the line to which she
had attached herself, being assaulted in flank
by a body of the spahis, wheeled about in order
to sustain the charge, and received them
with such a seasonable fire, as brought a great
number of turbans to the ground; among
those who fell was one of the chiefs, or
aga's, who had advanced before the rest, with
a view to signalize his valour. 
Our English Penthesilea no sooner saw this
Turkish leader drop, than, struck with the
magnificence of his own and horse's trappings, 

she sprung foreward to seize them as her prize,
and found the aga not dead, though in a good
measure disabled by his misfortune, which was
intirely owing to the weight of his horse, that
having been killed by a musket-ball, lay upon
his leg, so that he could not disingage himself. 
Nevertheless, perceiving the virago approach
with fell intent, he brandished his scymitar,
and tried to intimidate his assailant with a
most horrible exclamation; but it was not
the dismal yell of a dismounted cavalier, tho'
enforced with a hideous ferocity of countenance,
and the menacing gestures with which
he waited her approach, that could intimidate
such an undaunted she-campaigner; she saw
him writhing in the agonies of a situation
from which he could not move; and, running
towards him with the nimbleness and intrepidity
of a Camilla, described a semicircle in the
progress of her assault, and attacking him on
one side, plunged her well tried dagger in his
throat: the shades of death encompassed him,
his life-blood issued at the wound, he fell
prone upon the earth, he bit the dust, and
having thrice invoked the name of Allah!
straight expired. 
While this destiny was thus fulfilled, his
followers began to reel; they seemed dismayed
at the fate of their chief, beheld their companions
drop like the leaves in autumn, and
suddenly halted in the midst of their career. 
The Imperialists observing the confusion of
the enemy, redoubled their fire; and raising a
dreadful shout, advanced in order to improve
the advantage they had gained: the spahis
durst not wait the shock of such an encounter; 

they wheeled to the right about, and clapping
spurs to their horses, fled in the utmost disorder. 
This was actually the circumstance that
turned the scale of battle: the Austrians pursued
their good fortune with uncommon impetuosity,
and in a few minutes, left the field
clear for the mother of our hero, who was
such an adept in the art of stripping, that in
the twinkling of an eye, the bodies of the
aga and his Arabian, lay naked to the skin. 
It would have been happy for her, had she
been contented with these first-fruits reaped
from the fortune of the day, and retired with
her spoils, which were not inconsiderable; 
but, intoxicated with the glory she had won,
inticed by the glittering caparisons that lay scattered
on the plain, and without doubt, prompted
by the secret instinct of her fate, she resolved
to seize opportunity by the fore lock, and once
for all indemnify herself for the many fatigues,
hazards and sorrows she had undergone. 
Thus determined, she reconnoitred the field,
and practised her address so successfully, that in
less than half an hour, she was loaded with ermin
and embroidery, and disposed to retreat
with her burden, when her regards were solicited
by a splendid bundle, which she descried at
some distance lying on the ground. This was
no other than an unhappy officer of hussars; 
who, after having had the good fortune to take
a Turkish standard, was desperately wounded
in the thigh, and obliged to quit his horse; 
finding himself in such an helpless condition,
he had wrapped his acquisition round his body,
that whatever might happen, he and his
glory should not be parted; and thus shrouded 

among the dying and the dead, he had observed
the progress of our heroine, who stalked
about the field, like another Atropos, finishing,
wherever she came, the work of
death: he did not at all doubt, that he himself
would be visited in the course of her peregrinations,
and therefore provided for her reception,
with a pistol ready cock'd in his hand,
while he lay perdue, beneath his covert, in all
appearance bereft of life: He was not deceived
in his prognostic; she no sooner eyed the
golden crescent, than, enflamed with curiosity
or cupidity, she directed thitherward her steps,
and discerning the carcase of a man, from
which she thought, there would be a necessity
for disengaging it, she lifted up her weapon,
in order to make sure of her purchase; and in
the very instant of discharging her blow, receiv'd
a brace of bullets in her brain. 
Thus ended the mortal pilgrimage of this
modern amazon; who, in point of courage,
was not inferior to Semiramis, Tomyris, Zenobia,
Thalestris, or any boasted heroine of
antient times. It cannot be supposed, that this
catastrophe made a very deep impression upon
the mind of young Ferdinand, who had just
then attained the ninth year of his age, and
been, for a considerable time, weaned from
her maternal caresses; especially, as he felt no
wants nor grievances in the family of the count,
who favoured him with a particular share of
indulgence, because he perceived in him a spirit
of docility, insinuation, and sagacity, far above
his years. He did not, however, fail to
lament the untimely fate of his mother, with
such filial expressions of sorrow, as still more 

intimately recommended him to his patron; 
who, being himself a man of extraordinary
benevolence, looked upon the boy as a prodigy
of natural affection, and foresaw in his future
services a fund of gratitude and attachment,
that could not fail to render him a valuable acquisition
to his family. 
In his own country he had often seen connections
of that sort, which having been planted
in the infancy of the adherent, had grown
up to a surprizing pitch of fidelity and friendship,
that no temptation could biass, and no
danger dissolve. He therefore rejoiced in the
hope of seeing his own son accommodated with
such a faithful attendant, in the person of
young Fathom, on whom he resolved to bestow
the same education he had planned for the
other, though conveyed in such a manner as
should be suitable to the sphere in which he
was ordained to move. In consequence of
these determinations, our young adventurer led
a very easy life, in quality of page to the count,
in whose tent he lay upon a pallet, close to his
field bed, and often diverted him with his childish
prattle in the English tongue, which the
more seldom his master had occasion to speak,
he the more delighted to hear. In the exercise
of his function, the boy was incredibly assiduous
and alert; far from neglecting the little
particulars of his duty, and embarking in the
mischievous amusements of the children belonging
to the camp, he was always diligent, sedate,
agreeably officious and anticipating, and in the
whole of his behaviour, seemed to express the
most vigilant sense of his patron's goodness and
generosity: nay, to such a degree had these 

sentiments, in all appearance, operated upon
his reflection, that, one morning while he supposed
the count asleep, he crept softly to his
bed-side, and gently kissing his hand, which
happened to be uncovered, pronounced, in a
low voice, a most fervent prayer in his behalf,
beseeching Heaven to shower down blessings
upon him, as the widow's friend and the orphan's
father: this benediction was not lost
upon the count, who chanced to be awake, and
heard it with admiration; but what rivetted
Ferdinand in his good graces, was a discovery
that our youth made, while his master was upon
duty in the trenches before Belgrade. 
Two foot-soldiers standing centry near the
door of the tent, were captivated with the sight
of some valuable moveables belonging to it; 
and suposing, in their great wisdom, that the
city of Belgrade was too well fortified to be
taken during that campaign, they came to a
resolution of withdrawing themselves from the
severe service of the trenches, by deserting to
the enemy, after they should have rifled count
Melvil's tent, of the furniture by which they
were so powerfully allured: the particulars of
this plan were concerted in the French language,
which, they imagined, would screen them
from all risk of being detected, in case they
should be overheard, though, as there was no
living creature in sight, they had no reason to
believe, that any person was privy to their conversation. 
Nevertheless, they were mistaken
in both these conjectures. The conference
reached the ears of Fathom, who was at the
other end of the tent, and had perceived the
eager looks, with which they considered some 

parts of the furniture: he had penetration
enough to suspect their desire, and alarmed by
that suspicion, listened attentively to their discourse,
which from a slender knowledge in the
French tongue, he had the good fortune partly
to understand. 
This important piece of intelligence he communicated
to the count at his return, and measures
were immediately taken to defeat the design,
and make an example of the authors,
who being permitted to load themselves with
the booty, were apprehended in their retreat,
and punished with death according to their
demerits.
