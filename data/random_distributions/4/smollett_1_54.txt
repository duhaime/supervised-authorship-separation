Repairs to the Metropolis, and enrols himself
among the sons of Pæan. 
Before this Affair could be brought to a
proper explanation, the season being almost
ended, the ladies departed from Tunbridge,
and in a little time doctor Fathom followed
them to London, having previously obtained
permission to visit them in that motropolis. 
He had sollicited the same favour of some other
families, in which he hoped to take root, though
he knew they were pre-engaged to different
physicians; and resolving to make his first
medical appearance in London, with some eclat,
he not only purchased an old chariot which was
new painted for the purpose, but likewise hired
a footman, whom he cloathed in laced livery,
in order to distinguish himself from the common
run of his brethren. 
This equipage, though much more expensive
than his finances could bear, he found absolutely
necessary, to give him a chance for employment; 
as every shabby retainer to physic, in
this capital, had provided himself with a vehicle, 

which was altogether used by way of a travelling
sign post, to draw in customers; so that
a walking physician was considered as an obscure
pedlar, trudging from street to street, with his
pack of knowledge on his shoulders, and selling
his remnants of advice by retail. A chariot
was not now set up for the convenience of a
man sinking under the fatigue of extensive
practice, but as a piece of furniture every way
as necessary as a large periwig with three tails:
and a physician, let his merit, in other respects,
be never so conspicuous, can no more expect to
become considerable in business, without the
assistance of this implement, than he can hope
to live without food, or breathe without a
windpipe. 
This requisite is so well understood, that,
exclusive of those who profess themselves doctors,
every raw surgeon, every idle apothecary,
who can make interest with some foolhardy
coachmaker, may be seen dancing the hays in
all places of public resort, and grinning to one
another from their respective carriages. Hence
proceed many of those cruel accidents which
are recorded in the daily papers. An apothecary's
horses take fright, and run away with
his chariot, which is heard of no more: an
eminent surgeon being overturned, is so terrified
at the thoughts of mutilation, that he resolves
to walk on foot all the days of his life; 
and the coachman of a physician of great practice,
having the misfortune to be disabled by a
fall from the box, his master can never find
another to supply his place. 
None of these observations escaped the penetrating
eye of Fathom, who, before he pretended 

to seat himself in his machine, had made
proper inquiry into all the other methods practised,
with a view to keep the wheels in motion. 
In his researches, he found that the great world
was wholly engrossed by a few practitioners
who had arrived at the summit of reputation,
consequently were no longer obliged to cultivate
those arts by which they rose; and that
the rest of the business was parcelled out into
small inclosures, occupied by different groupes
of personages, male and female, who stood in
rings, and tossed the ball from one to another,
there being in each department two sets, the
individuals of which relieved one another occasionally. 
Every knot was composed of a waiting-woman,
nurse, apothecary, surgeon and
physician, and, sometimes, a midwife was admitted
into the partie; and in this manner the
farce was commonly performed. 
A fine lady, fatigued with idleness, complains
of the vapours, is deprived of her rest, tho' not
so sick as to have recourse to medicine: her
favourite maid, tired with giving her attendance
in the night, thinks proper, for the benefit of
her own repose, to complain of a violent headach,
and recommends to her mistress a nurse
of approved tenderness and discretion; at
whose house (in all likelihood) the said chamber-maid
hath oft given the rendezvous to a
male friend. The nurse, well skilled in the
mysteries of her occupation, persuades the patient,
that her malady, far from being slight or
chimerical, may proceed to a very dangerous
degree of the hysterical affection, unless it be
nipt in the bud by some very effectual remedy:
then she recounts a surprising cure performed 

by a certain apothecary, and appeals to the testimony
of the waiting woman, who being the
gossip of his wife, confirms the evidence, and
corroborates the proposal. The apothecary
being summoned, finds her ladyship in such a
delicate situation, that he declines prescribing,
and advises her to send for a physician without
delay. The nomination, of course, falls to
him, and the doctor being called, declares the
necessity of immediate venæsection, which is
accordingly performed by the surgeon of the
association. 
This is one way of beginning the game:
tho' the commencement often varies, and sometimes
the apothecary, and sometimes the physician
opens the scene; but, be that as it will,
they always appear in a string, like a flight of
wild geese, and each confederacy maintains a
correspondence with one particular undertaker. 
Fathom, upon these considerations, set up his
rest in the first floor of an apothecary in the
neighbourhood of Charing-cross, to whom he
was introduced by a letter from a friend at
Tunbridge, and who being made acquainted
with his ability and scheme, promised to let slip
no opportunity of serving him; and, indeed,
seemed to espouse his interest with great alacrity. 
He introduced him to some of his patients,
on the strength of a gratis visit, sounded forth
his praise among all the good women of his
acquaintance; and even prevailed upon him to
publish advertisements, importing, that he
would, every day, at a certain time and place,
give his advice to the poor for nothing; hoping,
that, by means of some lucky cure, his 

fame might be extended, and his practice grow
into request. 
In the mean time, his chariot rolled along
through all the most frequented streets, during
the whole forenoon, and, at the usual
hour, he never failed to make his appearance
at the medical coffee house, with all that solemnity
of feature and address, by which the
modern sons of Pæan are distinguished; not
but that he was often puzzled about the decision
of his diurnal route: for the method of
driving up one street, and down another,
without halting, was become such a stale expedient,
that the very prentices used to stand
at the shop doors, and ridicule the vain parade. 
At length, however, he perused the map of
London with great diligence, and having acquired
a distinct idea of its topography, used
to alight at the end of long narrow thoroughfares,
and paved courts, where the chariot was
ordered to wait till his return; and walking
with great gravity through the different
turnings of these alleys, regain his carriage by
another passage, and resume his seat with an
air of vast importance. With a view to protract
the time of his supposed visits, he would,
at one place, turn aside to the wall; at another,
cheapen an urinal; at a third corner,
read a quack advertisement, or lounge a few
minutes in some bookseller's shop; and, lastly,
glide into some obscure coffeehouse, and treat
himself with a dram of usquebaugh. 
The other means used to force a trade, such
as ordering himself to be called from church,
alarming the neighbourhood with knocking
at his door in the night, receiving sudden messages 

in places of resort, and inserting his
cures by way of news in the daily papers, had
been so injudiciously hackneyed by every desperate
sculler in physick, that they had lost
their effect upon the publick, and therefore
were excluded from the plan of our adventurer,
whose scheme, for the present, was to
exert himself in winning the favour of those
sage Sybils, who keep, as it were, the temple
of medicine, and admit the young priest to the
service of the altar; but this he considered as
a temporary project only, until he should have
acquired interest enough to erect an hospital,
lock, or infirmary, by the voluntary subscription
of his friends; a scheme which had succeeded
to a miracle, with many of the profession,
who had raised themselves into notice,
upon the carcases of the poor. 
Yet, even this branch was already overstocked,
insomuch that almost every street was
furnished with one of these charitable receptacles,
which, instead of diminishing the taxes
for the maintainance of the poor, encouraged
the vulgar to be idle and dissolute, by opening
an asylum to them, and their families, from
the diseases of poverty and intemperance: for
it remains to be proved, that the parish rates
are decreased, the bills of mortality lessened,
the people more numerous, or the streets less
infested with beggars, notwithstanding the immense
sums yearly granted by individuals for
the relief of the indigent. 
But, waving these reflections, doctor Fathom
hoped, that his landlord would be a most
useful implement for extending his influence,
and, for that reason, admitted him into a degree 

of partnership, after being fully convinced,
that he was not under articles to any other
physician. Nevertheless, he was very much
mistaken in reckoning on the importance of
this new ally, who was, like himself, a needy
adventurer, settled upon credit, and altogether
unemployed, except among the very refuse
of the people, whom no other person
would take the trouble to attend: so that our
hero got little else than experience and trouble,
excepting a few guineas, which he
made shift to glean among sojourners, with
whom he became occasionally acquainted, or
young people, who had been unfortunate in
their amours. 
In the midst of these endeavours, he did
not omit his duty to the old gentlewoman,
whose daughter he had cured at Tunbridge; 
and was always received with particular complacency,
which, perhaps, he, in some measure,
owed to his genteel equipage, that gave
credit to every door before which it was seen; 
yet Miss Biddy was as inaccessible as ever, while
the mother became more and more warm in
her civilities, till at length, after having prepared
him with some extraordinary compliments,
she gave him to understand, that Biddy
was no better than a giddy-headed girl, far
from being unexceptionable in her moral character,
and particularly deficient in duty and
gratitude to her, who had been always a tender
and indulgent parent; she was therefore
determined to punish the young minx, for her
levity, and want of natural affection, by altering
her own condition, could she find a
worthy and agreeable man, on whom she could 

bestow her hand and fortune without a blush. 
The film was instantly removed from Fathom's
eyes by this declaration, which she uttered
with such a significancy of look, as
thrilled to his soul with joyful presage, while
he replied, it would, indeed, be a difficult task
to find a man who merited such happiness and
honour; but, surely, some there were, who
would task their faculties to the uttermost, in
manifesting their gratitude, and desire of rendering
themselves worthy of such distinction. 
Though this answer was pronounced in such a
manner, as gave her to understand he had taken
the hint, she would not cheapen her condescension
so much as to explain herself further
at that juncture, and he was very well
contented to woo her on her own terms; accordingly
he began to season his behaviour
with a spice of gallantry, when he had opportunities
of being particular with this new inamorata,
and, in proportion to the returns she
made, he gradually detached himself from
Miss Biddy, by intermitting, and, at last, discontinuing
those ardent expressions of love
and admiration, which he had made shift to
convey in private looks and stolen whispers,
during the rancorous inspection of her mother. 
Such alteration could not long escape the
jealous eyes of the young lady, no more than
the cause of this alienation, which, in a moment,
converted all her love into irreconcilable
hate, and filled her whole soul with the most
eager desire of vengeance: for she now not
only considered him as a mercenary wretch,
who had slighted her attractions for the sordid 

gratifications of avarice, but also as an interloper,
who wanted to intercept her fortune, in
the odious character of a father-in law. But,
before she could bring her aim to any ripeness
of contrivance, her mother, having caught cold
at church, was seized with a rheumatic fever,
became delirious in less than three days, and,
notwithstanding all the prescriptions and care
of her admirer, gave up the ghost, without
having retrieved the use of her senses, or been
able to manifest, by will, the sentiments she entertained
in favour of her physician, who (as
the reader will easily perceive) had more reasons
than one, to be mortally chagrined at this
event. 
Miss Biddy being thus put in possession of
the whole inheritance, not only renounced all
correspondence with doctor Fathom, by forbidding
him the house, but likewise took all
opportunities of prejudicing his character, by
hinting, that her dear mamma had fallen a sacrifice
to his ignorance and presumption.
