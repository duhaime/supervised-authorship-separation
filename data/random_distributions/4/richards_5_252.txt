Miss Jervois, To Sir Charles Grandison. 


Thursday, Nov. 2.
A Few lines, Sir; a very few—Not to shew my vanity,
my pride, in being allowed to write to my
Guardian; nor to presume to draw him into an intercourse
of Letters. No, Sir, I write only to thank
you, which I do a thousand thousand times, for the
ease, the joy, you have given to my heart. O how I
dreaded to open your Letter! But I could not have
expected it to be so very indulgent to a faulty girl. 
Not one rebuke! O Sir! how very good you are! 
And to send me the money to clear my debts! To
bid me make my present! In so gracious a manner to
bid me! And to put me upon promising a provision
for life for Mr. O-Hara, if he survive my mother; 
which will not oblige them to live a narrower life
while they are together, in order to save, in view of
such an unhappy event—I flew to them, with the
good news—I read the whole Letter to them. O
how their hearts blessed you at their eyes, for they
could not presently speak; and how my tears mingled
with theirs! O Sir, you made us all infants! —I, for
my part, am still a baby! —Did I ever cry so much
for grief, as you have made me cry for joy? —It is well
something now-and-then comes to check one's joy; 
there would be no bearing it, else. But I shall encroach
on your precious time. Thank you, thank
you, Sir, a hundred thousand times. My mother is
happy! Mr. O-Hara is happy! My Miss Byron will
soon be the happiest of all human beings, thank God! 
—You, my Guardian, must be one of the happiest of
men! May every-body else be happy that you wish to
be so! And then how happy will be, good Sir, 
Your dutiful Ward, and obliged Servant,
ever to be commanded,
Emily Jervois! 

They say you set out for Northamptonshire next
Monday or Tuesday, at furthest. Lord bless me! 
—Lord bless you! I would say—And bless everybody
you love! —Amen!—for ever and ever!
