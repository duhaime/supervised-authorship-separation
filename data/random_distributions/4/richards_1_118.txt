Miss Clarissa Harlowe, To Miss Howe. 

You tell me, my dear, that my cloaths and the
little sum of money I left behind me, will not be
sent me. —But I will still hope. It is yet early days. 
When their passions subside, they will better consider 

of the matter; and especially as I have my ever dear
and excellent Mother for my friend in this request. O
the sweet indulgence! How has my heart bled, and
how does it still bleed for her! 
You advise me not to depend upon a Reconciliation. 
I do not, I cannot, depend upon it. But nevertheless
it is the wish next my heart. And as to this man, what
can I do? You see, that Marriage is not absolutely in
my own power, if I were inclined to prefer it to the
trial which I think I ought to have principally in view
to make for a Reconciliation. 
You say, he is proud and insolent—Indeed he is. 
But can it be your opinion, that he intends to humble
me down to the level of his mean pride? 
And what mean you, my dear friend, when you
say, that I must throw off a little more of the veil? — 
Indeed I never knew that I wore one. Let me assure
you, that if I see any-thing in Mr. Lovelace that looks
like a design to humble me, his insolence shall never
make me discover a weakness unworthy of a person distinguished
by your friendship; that is to say, unworthy
either of my Sex, or of my former Self. 
But I hope, as I am out of all other protection, that
he is not capable of mean or low resentments. If he
has had any extraordinary trouble on my account, may
ne not thank himself for it? He may; and lay it, if
he pleases, to his Character; which, as I have told
him, gave at least a pretence to my Brother against him. 
And then, did I ever make him any promises? Did I
ever profess a Love for him? Did I ever wish for the
continuance of his address? Had not my Brother's violence
precipitated matters, would not my indifference
to him in all likelihood (as I designed it should) have
tired out his proud spirit (a) , and made him set out for
London, where he used chiefly to reside? And if he
had, would there not have been an end of all his pretensions
and hopes? For no encouragement had I given 

him: Nor did I then correspond with him. Nor, believe
me, should I have begun to do so—the fatal Rencounter
not having then happened; which drew me
in afterwards for others sakes (fool that I was!) and
not for my own. And can you think, or can he, that
even this but temporarily-intended correspondence
(which, by the way, my Mother (a)  connived at) would
have ended thus, had I not been driven on one hand,
and teazed on the other, to continue it; the occasion
which had at first induced it, continuing? What pretence
then has he, were I to be absolutely in his power,
to avenge himself on me, for the faults of others; and
thro' which I have suffered more than he? —It cannot,
cannot be, that I should have cause to apprehend him
to be so ungenerous, so bad, a man. 
You bid me not be concerned at the bickerings between
your Mother and you. Can I avoid concern,
when those bickerings are on my account? That they
are raised (instigated shall I say?) by my Uncle, and
my other relations, surely must add to my concern. 
But I must observe, perhaps too critically for the
state my mind is in at present, that the very sentences
you give from your Mother, as so many imperatives
which you take amiss, are very severe reflections upon
yourself. For instance—You shall, I tell you, Nancy,
implies, that you had disputed her will—And so of the
rest. 
And further let me observe, with respect to what
you say, that there cannot be the same reason for a
prohibition of correspondence with me, as there was of
mine with Mr. Lovelace; that I thought as little of
bad consequences from my correspondence with him at
the time, as you can do from yours with me, now. 
But if obedience be a duty, the breach of it is the fault,
however circumstances may differ. Surely there is no
merit in setting up our own judgment against the judgments
of our parents. And if it be punishable so to 

do, I have been severely punished; and that is what I
warned you of, from my own dear experience. 
Yet, God forgive me! I advise thus against myself
with very great reluctance: And, to say truth, have
not strength of mind, at present, to decline it myself. 
But, if the occasion go not off, I will take it into farther
consideration. 
You give me very good advice in relation to this
man; and I thank you for it. When you bid me be
more upon the reserve with him in expressing my displeasure,
perhaps I may try for it: But to palliate, as
you call it, that, my dearest Miss Howe, cannot be
done, by 
Your own
Clarissa Harlowe.
