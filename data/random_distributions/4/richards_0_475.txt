Mr. Belford. In Continuation. 

Soho, Six o'clock, Sept. 7. 
The Lady is still alive. The Colonel having just
sent his servant to let me know, that she inquired
after me about an hour ago, I am dressing to attend
her. Joel begs of me to dispatch him back, tho' but with
one line to gratify your present impatience. He expects,
he says, to find you at Knightsbridge, let him
make what haste he can back; and if he has not a line or 

two to pacify you, he is afraid you will pistol him; for
he apprehends that you are hardly yourself. I therefore
dispatch this; and will have another ready as soon as I can,
with particulars. But you must have a little patience; for
how can I withdraw every half hour to write, if I am admitted
to the Lady's presence, or if I am with the Colonel? 
Smith's, 8 o'clock in the morning. 
The Lady is in a slumber. Mrs. Lovick, who sat up
with her, says, she had a better night than was expected; 
for altho' she slept little, she seemed easy; and the easier
for the pious frame she was in; all her waking moments
being taken up in devotion, or in an ejaculatory silence; 
her hands and eyes often lifted up, and her lips moving
with a fervor worthy of these her last hours. 
Ten o'clock. 
The Colonel being earnest to see his cousin as soon as
she awaked, we were both admitted. We observed in her,
as soon as we entered, strong symptoms of her approaching
dissolution, notwithstanding what the women had
flattered us with, from her last night's tranquility. The
Colonel and I, each loth to say what we thought, looked
upon one another with melancholy countenances. 
The Colonel told her, He should send a servant to her
uncle Antony's, for some papers he had left there; and
asked, If she had any commands that way? —She thought
not, she said, speaking more inwardly than she did the
day before. She had indeed a letter ready to be sent to her
good Mrs. Norton; and there was a request intimated in
it. But it was time enough, if it were signified to those whom it concerned, when all was over. However, it might
be sent then by the servant who was going that way. And
she caused it to be given to the Colonel for that purpose. 
Her breath being very short, she desired another pillow; 
and having two before, this made her in a manner fit
up in her bed; and she spoke then with more distinctness; 
and, seeing us greatly concerned, forgot her own sufferings
to comfort us; and a charming lecture she gave us,
tho' a brief one, upon the happiness of a timely prepatation,
and upon the hazards of a late repentance, when
the mind, as she observed, was so much weakened, as 

well as the body, as to render a poor soul unable to contend
with its own infirmities. 
I beseech ye, my good friends, proceeded she, mourn
not for one who mourns not, nor has cause to mourn, for
herself. One the contrary, rejoice with me, that all my
worldly troubles are so near their end. Believe me, Sirs,
that I would not, if I might, choose to live, altho' the
pleasantest part of my life were to come over again: And
yet Eighteen years of it, out of Nineteen, have been very
pleasant. To be so much exposed to temptation, and to
be so liable to fail in the trial, who would not rejoice, that
all her dangers are over! —All I wished was pardon and
blessing from my dear parents. Easy as my departure
seems to promise to be, it would have been still easier, had
I had that pleasure. But God Almighty would
not let me depend for comfort upon any but
Himself. 
She then repeated her request, in the most earnest manner,
to her cousin, that he would not heighten her fault,
by seeking to avenge her death; to me, that I would endeavour
to make up all breaches, and use the power I
had with my friend, to prevent all future mischiefs from
him, as well as that which this trust might give me, to
prevent any to him. 
She made some excuses to her cousin, for having not
been able to alter her will, to join him in the executorship
with me; and to me, for the trouble she had given
and yet should give me. 
She had fatigued herself so much (growing sensibly
weaker) that the sunk her head upon her pillows, ready
to faint; and we withdrew to the window, looking upon
one another; but could not tell what to say; and yet both
seemed inclinable to speak: But the motion passed over in
silence. Our eyes only spoke; and that in a manner neither's
were used to; mine, at least, not till I knew this admirable
creature. 
The Colonel withdrew to dismiss his messenger, and
send away the letter to Mrs. Norton. I took the opportunity
to retire likewise; and to write thus far. And
Joel returning, to take it; I now close here. 
Eleven o'Clock.
