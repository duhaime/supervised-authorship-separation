Peregrine reconciles himself to the lieutenant; and
renews his connection with society. Divers plans
are projected in his behalf; and he has occasion
to exhibit a remarkable proof of self-denial. 
The captain, with reluctance, yielded the
preference in this particular to Jack, who
was immediately invited to a conference, by a
note subscribed with Pickle's own hand. He was
found at the prison-gate waiting for Gauntlet, to
know the issue of his negotiation; and no sooner
received this summons than he set all his sails,
and made the best of his way to his friend's
apartment; being admitted by the turnkey, in
consequence of Peregrine's request, communicated
by the messenger who carried the billet. 
Pipes followed close in the wake of his shipmate; 
and, in a few minutes after the note had
been dispatched, Peregrine and Gauntlet heard
the sound of the stump, ascending the wooden
stair-case with such velocity, that they at first
mistook it for the application of drum-sticks to
the head of an empty barrel. This uncommon
speed, however, was attended with a misfortune:
he chanced to overlook a small defect in one of
the steps, and, his prop plunging into a hole, he
fell backwards, to the imminent danger of his
life. Tom was luckily at his back, and sustained 

him in his arms, so as that he escaped without
any other damage than the loss of his wooden
leg, which was snapt in the middle, by the weight
of his body, in falling: and such was his impatience,
that he would not give himself the
trouble to disengage the fractured member; but
unbuckling the whole equipage in a trice, left it
sticking in the crevice, saying a rotten cable was
not worth heaving up, and, in this natural state
of mutilation, hopp'd into the room with infinite
expedition. 
Peregrine taking him cordially by the hand,
seated him upon one side of his bed; and after
having made an apology for that reserve, of which
he had so justly complained, asked, if he could
conveniently accommodate him with the loan of
twenty guineas. The lieutenant, without opening
his mouth, pulled out his purse; and Pipes,
who overheard the demand, applying the whistle
to his lips, performed a loud overture, in token
of his joy. Matters being thus brought to an
accommodation, our hero told the captain, that
he should be glad of his company at dinner, with
their common friend Hatchway, if he would in
the mean time leave him to the ministry of Pipes; 
and the soldier went away for the present, in
order to pay a short visit to his uncle, who, at
that time, languished in a declining state of
health, promising to return at the appointed
hour. 
The lieutenant, having survey'd the dismal
appearance of his friend, could not help being
moved at the spectacle, and began to upbraid him
with his obstinate pride, which (he swore) was
no better than self-murder. But the young gentleman
interrupted him in the course of his moralizing, 

by telling him he had reasons for his
conduct, which, perhaps, he should impart in
due season; but, at present, his design was to
alter that plan of behaviour, and make himself
some amends for the misery he had undergone. 
He accordingly sent Pipes to redeem his cloaths
from the pawnbroker's wardrobe, and bespeak
something comfortable for dinner. And when
Godfrey came back, he was very agreeably surprised
to see such a favourable alteration in his
externals; for, by the assistance of his valet, he
had purified himself from the dregs of his distress,
and now appeared in a decent suit, with clean
linnen, while his face was disencumbered of the
hair that overshadowed it, and his apartment
prepared for the reception of company. 
They enjoyed their meal with great satisfaction,
entertaining one another with a recapitulation
of their former adventures at the garison; 
and in the afternoon, Gauntlet taking his leave,
in order to write a letter to his sister, at the desire
of his uncle, who finding his end approaching,
wanted to see her without loss of time, Peregrine
made his appearance on the bear, and was complimented
on his coming abroad again, not only
by his old mess-mates, who had not seen him for
many weeks, but by a number of those objects
whom his liberality had fed, before his funds
were exhausted. Hatchway was, by his interest
with the warden, put in possession of his former
quarters, and Pipes dispatched to make inquiry
about Crabtree at his former lodging, where
he learn'd, that the Misanthrope, after a very
severe fit of illness, was removed to Kensington
Gravel-pits, for the convenience of breathing a
purer air than that of London. 

In consequence of this information, Peregrine,
who knew the narrowness of the old gentleman's
fortune, next day desired his friend Gauntlet to
take the trouble of visiting him, in his name,
with a letter, in which he expressed great concern
for his indisposition, gave him notice of the
fortunate intelligence he had received from the
Downs, and conjured him to make use of his
purse, if he was in the least hampered in his circumstances. 
The captain took coach immediately,
and set out for the place, according to
the direction which Pipes had procured. 
Cadwallader having seen him at Bath, knew
him again at first sight; and, though reduced to
a skeleton, believed himself in such a fair way of
doing well, that he would have accompanied him
to the Fleet immediately, had not he been restrained
by his nurse, who had been, by his physician,
invested with full authority to dispute and
oppose his will, in every thing that she should
think prejudicial to his health; for he was considered,
by those who had the care of him, as
an old humourist, not a little distempered in his
brain. He inquired particularly about the sailors,
who (he said) had deterred him from carrying
on his usual correspondence with Pickle, and
been the immediate cause of his indisposition, by
terrifying him into a fever: and understanding
that the breach between Pickle and Hatchway
was happily cemented, and that he was no longer
in any danger from the lieutenant's resentment, he
promised to be at the Fleet with the first convenient
opportunity; and, in the mean time, wrote
an answer to Peregrine's letter, importing, that
he was obliged to him for his offer, but had not
the least occasion for his assistance. 

In a few days, our adventurer recovered his
vigour, complexion and vivacity; he mingled
again in the diversions and parties of the place; 
he received, in a little time, the money he had
lent upon bottomry, which, together with the
interest, amounted to upwards of eleven hundred
pounds. The possession of this sum, while it
buoyed up his spirits, involved him in perplexity. 
Sometimes he thought it was incumbent upon
him, as a man of honour, to employ the greatest
part of it, in diminishing the debt for which he
suffered; on the other hand, he considered that
obligation effaced, by the treacherous behaviour
of his creditor, who had injured him to ten times
the value of the sum; and in these sentiments,
entertained thoughts of attempting his escape
from prison, with a view of conveying himself,
with the shipwreck of his fortune, to another
country, in which he might use it to better advantage. 
Both suggestions were attended with such
doubts and difficulties, that he hesitated between
them, and for the present, laid out a thousand
pounds in stock, the interest of which, together
with the fruits of his own industry, he hoped,
would support him above want in his confinement,
until something should occur, that would
point out the expediency of some other determination. 
Gauntlet still insisted upon having
the honour of obtaining his liberty, at the expence
of taking up his notes to Gleanum, and exhorted
him to purchase a commission with part
of the money which he had retrieved. The lieutenant
affirmed, that it was his privilege to procure
the release of his cousin Pickle, because he
enjoyed a very handsome sum by his aunt, which 

of right belonged to the young gentleman, to
whom he was, moreover, indebted for the use
of his furniture, and for the very house that
stood over his head; and that, although he had
already made a will in his favour, he should never
be satisfied, nor easy in his mind, so long as he
remained deprived of his liberty, and wanted any
of the conveniences of life. 
Cadwallader, who by this time assisted at their
councils, and was best acquainted with the peculiarity
and unbending disposition of the youth,
proposed, that seeing he was so averse to obligations,
Mr. Hatchway should purchase of him
the garison with its appendages, which, at a
moderate price, would sell for more money than
would be sufficient to discharge his debts; and
that, if the servile subordination of the army
did not suit his inclinations, he might, with his
reversion, buy a comfortable annuity, and retire
with him to the country, where he might live
absolutely independent, and entertain himself, as
usual, with the ridiculous characters of mankind. 
This plan was, to Pickle, less disagreeable than
any other project which had as yet been suggested; 
and the lieutenant declared himself ready to execute
his part of it, without delay: but the soldier
was mortified at the thoughts of seeing his
assistance unnecessary, and eagerly objected to the
retirement, as a scheme that would blast the
fairest promises of fame and fortune, and bury
his youth and talents in solitude and obscurity. 
This earnest opposition on the part of Gauntlet,
hindered our adventurer from forming any immediate
resolution; which was also retarded by his
unwillingness to part with the garrison upon any
terms, because he looked upon it as a part of his 

inheritance, which he could not dispose of, without
committing an insult upon the memory of
the deceased commodore.
