Miss Arabella Harlowe, To Miss Howe. 

Friday July 21. 
Miss Anna Howe,
Your pert letter I have received. You, that spare
no-body, I cannot expect should spare me. You
are very happy in a prudent and watchful mother—But
else—Mine cannot be exceeded in prudence: But we had
all too good an opinion of Somebody, to think watchfulness
needful. There may possibly be some reason why
you are so much attached to her, in an error of this flagrant
nature. 
I help to make a sister unhappy! —It is false, Miss! — 
It is all her own doings! —Except, indeed, what she may
owe to Somebody's advice—You know who can best answer
for that. 
Let us know your mind as soon as you please: As we
shall know it to be your mind, we shall judge what attention
to give it. That's all, from, &c. 
Ar. H.
