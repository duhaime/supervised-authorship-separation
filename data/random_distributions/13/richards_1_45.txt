Miss Clarissa Harlowe, To Miss Howe. 

Tuesday, March 21. 
&dotup;Would you not have thought, my dear Miss
Howe, as well as I, that my proposal must
have been accepted: And that my Brother, by the
last article of his unbrotherly Letter (where he
threatens to go to Scotland if it should be hearkened
to) was of opinion that it would. 
&dotup;For my part, after I had read the unkind Letter
over and over, I concluded, upon the whole, that a
Reconciliation upon terms so disadvantageous to myself,
as hardly any other person in my case, I dare
say, would have proposed, must be the result of this
morning's conference. And in that belief I had
begun to give myself new trouble in thinking (this
difficulty over) how I should be able to pacify Lovelace
on that part of my engagement, by which I
undertook to break off all correspondence with him,
unless my friends should be brought by the interposition
of his powerful friends, and any offers they
might make (which it was rather his part to suggest,
than mine to intimate) to change their minds. 
&dotup;Thus was I employed, not very agreeably, you
may believe, because of the vehemence of the tempers
I had to conflict with; when breakfasting-time
approached, and my judges began to arrive. 
&dotup;And oh! how my heart fluttered on hearing the
chariot of the one, and then of the other, rattle
thro' the court-yard, and the hollow-sounding footstep
giving notice of each person's stepping out, to
take his place on the awful bench which my fancy
had formed for them and my other judges! 
&dotup;That, thought I, is my Aunt Hervey's! That
my Uncle Harlowe's! Now comes my Uncle Antony! 
And my imagination made a fourth chariot 

for the odious Solmes, altho' it happened that he
was not there. 
&dotup;And now, thought I, are they all assembled: 
And now my Brother calls upon my Sister to make
her report! Now the hard-hearted Bella interlards
her speech with invective! Now has she concluded
her report! Now they debate upon it! —Now does
my Brother flame! Now threaten to go to Scotland! 
Now is he chidden, and now soothed! 
&dotup;And then I ran thro' the whole conference in my
imagination, forming speeches for this person and
that, pro and con. till all concluded, as I flattered
myself, in an acceptance of my conditions, and in
giving directions to have an instrument drawn to tie
me up to my good behaviour: While I supposed all
agreed to give Solmes a Wife every way more worthy
of him, and with her the promise of my Grandfather's
Estate, in case of my forfeiture, or dying
unmarried, on the righteous condition he proposes
to entitle himself to it with me. 
&dotup;And now, thought I, am I to be ordered down
to recognize my own proposals. And how shall I
look upon my awful judges? How shall I stand
the questions of some, the set surliness of others,
the returning love of one or two? How shall I be
affected! 
&dotup;Then I wept: Then I dried my eyes: Then I
practised at my glass for a look more chearful than
my heart. 
&dotup;And now [as any-thing stirred] is my Sister
coming to declare the issue of all! Tears gushing
again, my heart fluttering as a bird against its
wires; drying my eyes again and again to no purpose. 
&dotup;And thus, my Nancy [Excuse the fanciful prolixity]
was I employed, and such were my thoughts
and imaginations, when I found a very different
result from the hopeful conference. 

&dotup;For about Ten o'clock up came my Sister, with
an air of cruel triumph, waving her hand with a light
flourish—&dotup; 
&dotup;Obedience without reserve is required of you,
Clary. My Papa is justly incensed, that you should
presume to dispute his will, and to make conditions
with him. He knows what is best for you: And
as you own matters are gone a great way between
this hated Lovelace and you, they will believe nothing
you say; except you will give the one only instance,
that will put them out of doubt of the sincerity of
your promises. 
&dotup;What, child, are you surprised? —Cannot you
speak? —Then, it seems, you had expected a different
issue, had you? —Strange that you could! — 
With all your acknowlegements and confessions, so
creditable to your noted prudence!—&dotup; 
&dotup;I was indeed speechless for some time: My eyes
were even fixed, and ceased to flow. But, upon the
hard-hearted Bella's proceeding with her airs of insult,
Indeed I was mistaken, said I; Indeed I was! 
—For in you, Bella, I expected, I hoped for, a
Sister—&dotup; 
&dotup;What! interrupted she, with all your mannerly
flings, and your despising airs, did you expect, that
I was capable of telling stories for you? —Did you
think, that when I was asked my own opinion of
the sincerity of your declarations, I could not tell
them, how far matters had gone between you and
your Fellow? —When the intention is to bend that
stubborn will of yours to your duty, do you think
I would deceive them? —Do you think I would encourage
them to call you down, to contradict all
that I should have invented in your favour?&dotup; 
&dotup;Well, well, Bella; I am the less obliged to you; 
that's all. I was willing to think, that I had still a
Brother and Sister. But I find I am mistaken.&dotup; 
&dotup;Pretty Mopsa-eyed soul! was her expression!— 

And was it willing to think it had still a Brother and
Sister? And why don't you go on, Clary? [mocking
my half-weeping accent] I thought too I had a
Father, and Mother, two Uncles, and an Aunt: But
I am mis—taken, that's all—Come, Clary, say this,
and it will in part be true, because you have thrown
off their authority, and because you respect one vile
wretch more than them all.&dotup; 
&dotup;How have I deserved this at your hands, Sister? — 
But I will only say, I pity you.&dotup; 
&dotup;And with that disdainful air too, Clary! —None
of that bridled neck! None of your scornful pity,
Girl! —I beseech you!&dotup; 
&dotup;This sort of behaviour is natural to you, surely,
Bella! —What new talents does it discover in you! — 
But proceed—If it be a pleasure to you, proceed,
Bella. And since I must not pity you, I will pity
myself: For nobody else will.&dotup; 
&dotup;Because you don't, said she—&dotup; 
&dotup;Hush, Bella, interrupting her, Because I don't
deserve it—I know you were going to say so. I
will say as you say in every-thing; and that's the
way to please you.&dotup; 
&dotup;Then say, Lovelace is a villain.&dotup; 
&dotup;So I will, when I think him so.&dotup; 
&dotup;Then you don't think him so?&dotup; 
&dotup;Indeed I don't. You did not always, Bella.&dotup; 
&dotup;And what, Clary, mean you by that? [bristling
up to me]—Tell me what you mean by that reflection?&dotup; 
&dotup;Tell me why you call it a reflection? —What did
I say!&dotup; 
&dotup;Thou art a provoking creature—But what say
you to two or three duels of that wretch's?&dotup; 
&dotup;I can't tell what to say, unless I knew the occasions.&dotup; 
&dotup;Do you justify duelling at all?&dotup; 
&dotup;I do not: Neither can I help his duelling.&dotup; 

&dotup;Will you go down, and humble that stubborn
spirit of yours to your Mamma?&dotup; 
&dotup;I said nothing.&dotup; 
&dotup;Shall I conduct your Ladyship down? [offering
to take my declined hand].&dotup; 
&dotup;What! not vouchsafe to answer me?&dotup; 
&dotup;I turned from her in silence.&dotup; 
&dotup;What! turn your back upon me too! —Shall I
bring up your Mamma to you, Love? [following
me, and taking my struggling hand] What! not
speak yet! Come, my sullen, silent dear, speak one
word to me—You must say two very soon to Mr.
Solmes, I can tell you that.&dotup; 
&dotup;Then [gushing out into tears, which I could not
hold in longer] they shall be the last words I will
ever speak.&dotup; 
&dotup;Well, well [insultingly wiping my averted face
with her handkerchief, while her other hand held
mine, in a ridiculing tone] I am glad any-thing will
make thee speak: Then you think you may be
brought to speak the two words—Only they are to
be the last! —How like a gentle Lovyer from its
tender bleeding heart was that!&dotup; 
&dotup;Ridiculous Bella!&dotup; 
&dotup;Saucy Clary! [changing her sneering tone to an
imperious one] But do you think you can humble
yourself to go down to your Mamma?&dotup; 
&dotup;I am tired with such stuff as this. Tell me,
Bella, if my Mamma will condescend to see me?&dotup; 
&dotup;Yes, if you can be dutiful at last.&dotup; 
&dotup;I can. I will.&dotup; 
&dotup;But what call you dutiful?&dotup; 
&dotup;To give up my own inclinations—That's something
more for you to tell of—in obedience to my
Parents commands; and to beg I may not be made
miserable with a man that is fitter for any-body than
for me.&dotup; 
&dotup;For me, do you mean, Clary?&dotup; 

&dotup;Why not? since you have put the question. You
have a better opinion of him than I have. My
friends, I hope, would not think him too good for
me, and not good enough for you. But cannot you
tell me, Bella, what is to become of me, without
insulting over me thus? —If I must be thus treated,
remember, that if I am guilty of any rashness, the
usage I meet with will justify it.&dotup; 
&dotup;So, Clary, you are contriving an excuse, I find,
for somewhat that we have not doubted has been in
your head a great while.&dotup; 
&dotup;If it were so, you seem resolved, for your part, and
so does my Brother for his, that I shall not want
one. —But indeed, Bella, I can bear no longer this
repetition of the worst part of yesterday's conversation: 
I desire I may throw myself at my Father's
and Mother's feet, and hear from them what their
sentence is. I shall at least avoid, by that means,
the unsisterly insults I meet with from you.&dotup; 
&dotup;Hey-day! What, is this you? Is it you, my meek
Sister Clary?&dotup; 
&dotup;Yes, it is I, Bella; and I will claim the protection
due to a child of the family, or to know
why I am to be thus treated, when I offer only to
preserve to myself the liberty of refusal, which belongs
to my Sex; and, to please my Parents, would
give up my choice. I have contented myself till now
to take second-hand messengers, and first-hand insults: 
You are but my Sister: My Brother is not
my Sovereign. And while I have a Father and
Mother living, I will not be thus treated by a Brother
and Sister, and their servants, all setting upon
me, as it should seem, to make me desperate, and
to do a rash thing. —I will know, in short, Sister
Bella, why I am to be constrained thus? —What is
intended by it? —And whether I am to be considered
as a child or a slave?&dotup; 
&dotup;She stood aghast all this time, partly with real,
partly with affected surprize.&dotup; 

&dotup;And is it you? Is it indeed you? —Well, Clary,
you amaze me! But since you are so desirous to refer
yourself to your Father and Mother, I will go
down, and tell them what you say. Your friends
are not yet gone, I believe: They shall assemble
again; and then you may come down, and plead
your own cause in person.&dotup; 
&dotup;Let me then. But let my Brother and you be absent. 
You have made yourselves too much parties
against me, to sit as my judges. And I desire to
have none of yours or his interpositions. I am sure
you could not have represented what I proposed
fairly: I am sure you could not. Nor is it possible
you should be commissioned to treat me thus.&dotup; 
&dotup;Well, well, I'll call up my Brother to you. —I
will indeed. —He shall justify himself, as well as me.&dotup; 
&dotup;I desire not to see my Brother, except he will
come as a Brother, laying aside the authority he has
unjustly assumed over me.&dotup; 
&dotup;And so, Clary, it is nothing to him, or to me, is
it? that our Sister shall disgrace her whole family?&dotup; 
&dotup;As how, Bella, disgrace it? —The man whom
you thus freely treat, is a man of birth and fortune: 
He is a man of parts, and nobly allied. —He was
once thought worthy of you; and I wish to Heaven
you had had him. I am sure it was not my fault you
had not, altho' you treat me thus!&dotup; 
&dotup;This set her into a flame: I wish I had forborn
it. O how the poor Bella raved! I thought she
would have beat me once or twice: And she vowed,
her fingers itched to do so—But I was not worth
her anger: Yet she flamed on. 
&dotup;We were heard to be high. —And Betty came up
from my Mother to command my Sister to attend
her. —She went down accordingly, threatening me
with letting every one know what a violent creature
I had shewn myself to be.&dotup; 

&dotup;Tuesday Noon, March 21. 
&dotup;I have as yet heard no more of my Sister: And
have not courage enough to insist upon throwing
myself at the feet of my Father and Mother, as I
thought in my heat of temper I should be able to do. 
And I am now grown as calm as ever; and were
Bella to come up again, as fit to be played upon as
before. 
&dotup;I am indeed sorry that I sent her from me in such
disorder. But my Papa's Letter threatening me
with my Uncle Antony's house and chapel, terrifies
me strangely; and by their silence I am afraid some
new storm is gathering. 
&dotup;But what shall I do with this Lovelace? I have
just now, by the unsuspected hole in the wall (that I
told you of in my Letter by Hannah) got a Letter
from him—So uneasy is he for fear I should be prevailed
upon in Solmes's favour; so full of menaces,
if I am; so resenting the usage I receive [for, how I
cannot tell; but he has undoubtedly intelligence of
all that is done in the family]; such protestations of
inviolable faith and honour; such vows of reformation; 
such pressing arguments to escape from this
disgraceful confinement. —O my Nancy, what shall
I do with this Lovelace?—&dotup;
