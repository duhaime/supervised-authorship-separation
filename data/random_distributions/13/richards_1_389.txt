Mrs. Norton, To Mrs. Harlowe. 

Friday, July 28. 
Honoured Madam,
Being forbidden (without leave) to send you
any-thing I might happen to receive from my
beloved Miss Clary, and so ill, that I cannot attend
to ask your leave, I give you this trouble, to let you
know, that I have received a Letter from her; which,
I think, I should hereafter be held inexcuseable, as
things may happen, if I did not desire permission to
communicate to you, and that as soon as possible. 
Applications have been made to the dear young
Lady from Lord M. from the two Ladies his Sisters,
and from both his Nieces, and from the wicked man
himself, to forgive and marry him. This, in noble
indignation for the usage she has received from him,
she has absolutely refused. And perhaps, Madam, if
you and the honoured family should be of opinion,
that to comply with their wishes is now the properest
measure that can be taken, the circumstances of things
may require your authority or advice, to induce her
to change her mind. 
I have reason to believe, that one motive for her
refusal is her full conviction, that she shall not long be
a trouble to any-body; and so she would not give a
Husband a right to interfere with her family, in relation
to the Estate her Grandfather devised to her. 
But of this, however, I have not the least intimation
from her. Nor would she, I dare say, mention it,
as a reason, having still stronger reasons, from his vile
treatment of her, to refuse him. 
The Letter I have received will shew how truly penitent 

the dear creature is; and if I have your permission,
I will send it sealed up, with a copy of mine, to
which it is an Answer. But as I resolve upon this
step without her knowlege [and indeed I do] I will
not acquaint her with it, unless it be attended with
desirable effects: Because, otherwise, besides making
me incur her displeasure, it might quite break her
already half-broken heart. I am, 
Honoured Madam,
Your dutiful and ever-obliged Servant,
Judith Norton.
