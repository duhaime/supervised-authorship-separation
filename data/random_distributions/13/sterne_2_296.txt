Having, a priori, intended
to dedicate The Amours of my
uncle Toby to Mr. ***—I see
more reasons, a posteriori, for doing
it to Lord *******. 
I should lament from my soul, if
this exposed me to the jealousy of
their Reverences; because, a posteriori, 

in Court-latin, signifies, the
kissing hands for preferment—or
any thing else—in order to get it. 
My opinion of Lord ******* is
neither better nor worse, than it was
of Mr. ***. Honours, like impressions
upon coin, may give an
ideal and local value to a bit of base
metal; but Gold and Silver will pass
all the world over without any
other recommendation than their
own weight. 
The same good will that made me
think of offering up half an hour's
amusement to Mr. *** when out of
place—operates more forcibly at 

present, as half an hour's amusement
will be more serviceable and
refreshing after labour and sorrow,
than after a philosophical repast. 
Nothing is so perfectly Amusement
as a total change of ideas; no
ideas are so totally different as those
of Ministers, and innocent Lovers:
for which reason, when I come to
talk of Statesmen and Patriots, and
set such marks upon them as will
prevent confusion and mistakes concerning
them for the future—I propose
to dedicate that Volume to some
gentle Shepherd, 

Whose Thoughts proud Science never taught to stray,
Far as the Statesman's walk or Patriot-way;

Yet simple Nature to his hopes had given
Out of a cloud-capp'd head a humbler heaven;
Some untam'd World in depth of woods embraced—
Some happier Island in the watry-waste—
And where admitted to that equal sky,
His faithful Dogs should bear him company.
In a word, by thus introducing an
entire new set of objects to his Imagination,
I shall unavoidably give a
Diversion to his passionate and love-sick
Contemplations. In the mean
time, 
I am
The AUTHOR.
