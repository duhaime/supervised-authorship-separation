Mr. Belford, To Robert Lovelace, Esq; 

Friday, Aug. 11. 
Mr. Belford acquaints his friend with the generosity
of Lord M. and the Ladies of his family; and
with the Lady's grateful sentiments upon the occasion. 
He says, that in hopes to avoid the pain of seeing him
[Mr. Lovelace], she intends to answer his Letter of
the 7th, tho' much against her inclination. 
‘She took great notice, says Mr. Belford, of that
passage in yours, which makes necessary to the Divine
pardon, the forgiveness of a person causlesly
injured.’ 
‘Her grandfather, I find, has enabled her at
Eighteen years of age to make her Will, and to
devise great part of his Estate to whom she pleases
of the family, and the rest out of it (if she die
single) at her own discretion; and this to create
respect to her; as he apprehended that she would 

be envied: And she now resolves to set about making
her Will out of hand.’ 
Mr. Belford insists upon the promise he had made him,
not to molest the Lady: And gives him the contents of
her Answer to Lord M. and the Ladies of his Lordship's
family, declining their generous offers. See
Letter xxix.
