Mr. Lovelace, To John Belford, Esq; 

Sunday afternoon. 
O Belford! what a hair's-breadth escape have I had! 
—Such an one, that I tremble between terror
and joy, at the thoughts of what might have happened,
and did not. 
What a perverse girl is this, to contend with her
Fate; yet has reason to think, that her very Stars
fight against her! I am the luckiest of men! —But 

my breath almost fails me, when I reflect upon what
a slender thread my Destiny hung. 
But not to keep thee in suspense; I have, within
this half-hour, obtained possession of the expected Letter
from Miss Howe—And by such an accident! But
here, with the former, I dispatch this; thy messenger
waiting.
