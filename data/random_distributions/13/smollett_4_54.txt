I long to be revenged on Melinda—apply
to Banter for his assistance—he contrives
a scheme for that purpose, which is put in
execution with great success—I make an
attempt ont the heart of Miss Gripewell,
but am disappointed—I grow melancholy
at my disappointment, and have recourse to
the Bottle—receive a billet doux—am
ravished with the contents—find myself
involved in an intrigue, which I imagined
would make my fortune—am confounded
at my mistake, which banishes all thoughts
of matrimony. 
In the mean time, my attention was wholly
engrossed in search of another mistress, and the
desire of being revenged on Melinda, in both
which schemes I was very much assisted by Billy
Chatter, who was such a necessary creature
among the ladies, that in all private dances he
engaged the men. —To him therefore I applied,
desiring he would introduce me to a partner of
some figure, at the next private assembly, for the
sake of a frolick, the intention of which I would
afterwards communicate Billy, who had heard
something of a difference between Melinda and me,
immediately smoaked part of my design, and thinking
I only wanted to alarm her jealousy a little,
promised to gratify my desire, by matching me 

with a partner worth thirty thousand pounds, whom
the ladies of this end of the town, had lately taken
into their management and protection. —Upon
further inquiry, I found this person's name was
Miss Biddy Gripewell; that her father, who had
been a pawnbroker, died intestate, by which
means all his substance descended to this daughter,
who was so little a favourite, that could the old
man have prevailed with his own rapacious disposition,
to part with as much money as would
have paid the expence of a will, she would not
have inherited the sixth part of his fortune;— 
that during his life, so far from being educated
in a way suitable to such great expectations, she
was obliged to live like a servant wench, and do
the most menial offices in the family. —But his
funeral was no sooner performed, than she assumed
the fine lady, and found so many people of
both sexes, to flatter, caress and instruct her,
that, for want of discretion and experience, she
was grown insufferably vain and arrogant, and
pretended to no less than a duke or earl at least,
for her husband;—that she had the misfortune to
be neglected by the English quality, but a certain
poor Scottish Lord was then making interest to
be introduced to her acquaintance. —In the mean
time, she was fallen into the hands of a notable
lady, who had already disposed of her to a lieutenant
of foot, a distant relation of her ladyship's,
though Miss, as yet, knew nothing of the
affair; and lastly, that if I proposed to dance
with her, I must give him leave to represent me
as a knight or foreign count at least. —I was ravished
at this piece of information, and contented,
for one night, to personate a French Marquis,
that I might the easier fulfil my revenge. 

Having made the appointment with Chatter,
I went to Banter's lodgings, having by this time
conceived a great opinion of his penetration and
knowledge; and after I had injoined secrecy, told
him every circumstance of my disgrace with Melinda,
and imparted the plan I had projected to
mortify that proud coquette, desiring his advice in
improving, and assistance in executing the scheme. 
—Nothing could be more agreeable to his misanthropical
temper, than an account of her behaviour
and my resentment: He applauded my
resolution, and proposed that I should not only
provide myself in a proper partner, but also procure
such an one for Miss Goosetrap, as would
infallibly intail upon her the ridicule of all her acquaintance: 
For this purpose he mentioned his
barber, who, he said, was an exceeding coxcomb,
lately come from Paris, whose absurd
affectation and grimace would easily pass upon
her, for the sprightly politesse of a gentleman
improved by travel. —I hugged him for this hint; 
and he assured me, it would be no difficult matter
to make him believe, that Melinda having
seen him by accident, was captivated by his appearance,
and longed for his acquaintance. — 
He actually engaged him on this pretence, and
painted his good fortune in such colours, that
the poor shaver was quite beside himself with joy,
—He was immediately fitted with a tawdry suit
of cloaths belonging to Banter, and by him recommended
to Chatter, as a very pretty fellow,
just returned from his travels. —Master Billy, who
acted as gentleman-usher to a great many of the
fair sex in and about town undertook, at once,
to bespeak Melinda in his behalf; and every thing
happened according to my with. 

At the time appointed, I appeared, dressed to
the best advantage; and in the character of Marquis,
had the honour of opening the ball with
the rich heiress, who attracted the eyes of the
whole company, by the prodigious number of
jewels with which she was adorned. —Among
others, I perceived Melinda, who could no more
conceal her envy than astonishment at my success: 
Her curiosity was still more flagrant and
tormenting, for she had never seen Miss Gripewell
before; and Chatter, who alone could give
her any satisfaction on that head, was engaged in
conversation at the other end of the room. —I
observed her impatience, and exulted in her
chagrin; and after my partner was set, took the
opportunity of passing by her to make a slight
bow without stopping; which compleated my
triumph and her indignation. She changed colour,
bridled up, assumed an air of disdain, and
flirted her fan with such fury, that it went to
pieces in a moment, to the no small entertainment
of those who sat near and observed her. 
At length the metamorphosed barber took her
out, and acted his part with such ridiculous extravagance,
that the mirth of the whole company
was excited at his expence, and his partner
so much ashamed, that before the country dances
began, she retired in great confusion, under pretence
of being taken suddenly ill, and was followed
by her gallant, who no doubt, imagined
her indisposition was nothing but love; and laid
hold of the occasion of conducting her home,
to comfort her, with an assurance of his entertaining
a reciprocal passion. —They were no sooner
gone, than an inquisitive whisper of “Who is
he?” run round the room; and Chatter 

could give them no other intelligence about
him, than that he was a man of fortune, just
returned from his travels: I, who alone was acquainted
with his real quality, affected ignorance,
well knowing that female curiosity would not rest
satisfied with such a general account, and that
the discovery would proceed with a better grace
from any body than me. 
Mean while, I was tempted by the richness
of the prize, to practise upon Miss Gripewell's
heart, but soon found it too well fortified with pride
and indifference to yield to any efforts in my own
character, and I neither would nor could preserve
the title I had borrowed, longer than this night. 
As I expected, every thing came to light next
day: The barber, in pure simplicity of heart,
detected himself to Melinda, and discovered the
foundation of his hopes; she sickened at the affront,
and was ashamed to shew her face in publick
for many weeks after this accident. Poor
Chatter found it impossible to justify himself to
her satisfaction; was in utter disgrace with Miss
Gripewell, for having imposed me upon her as
a nobleman; and suffered very much in his
character and influence among the ladies in general. 
Finding my finances diminished more than
one half, and my project as little advanced: as
on the first day of my arrival in town, I began
to despair of my success, and grew melancholy
at the prospect of approaching want. —To dispel
the horrors of this fiend, I had recourse to
the bottle, and kept more company than ever. — 
I became particularly attached to the play-house,
conversed with the actors behind the scenes, got
acquainted with a body of templars, and in a 

short time commenced a professed wit and critick. 
Indeed I may say without vanity, that I was
much better qualified than any one of my companions,
who were, generally speaking, of all
the creatures I ever conversed with, the most ignorant
and assuming. —By means of these avocations
I got the better of care, and learned to
separate my ideas in such a manner, that whenever
I was attacked by a gloomy reflection, I could
shove it aside, and call in some agreeable reverie to
my assistance. —This was not the case with
Strap, who practised a thousand shifts to conceal
the sorrow that preyed upon his carcass, and reduced
him to the resemblance of a meer skeleton. 
While I thus posted, in a thoughtless manner,
towards poverty, I one day received, by the penny-post,
a letter written in a woman's hand,
containing a great many high-flown compliments,
warm protestations of love, couched in a very poetical
stile, an earnest desire of knowing whether or
not my heart was engaged, by leaving an answer at
a certain place directed to R. B. and the whole subscribed,
“Your incognita.” I was transported with
joy on reading the contents of this billet doux,
which I admired as a master-piece of tenderness
and elegance, and was already up to the ears in
love with the author, whom my imagination represented
as a lady of fortune, in the bloom of
youth and beauty. —Elevated with this conjecture,
I went to work and exhausted my invention in
composing an answer suitable to the sublimity of
her stile, and the ardour of her sentiments. —I
expressed my admiration of her wit, in terms
the most hyperbolical, and while I acknowledged
myself unworthy of her regard, declared myself
enamoured of her understanding; and in the 

most pathetick manner, implored the honour of
an interview. —Having finished this performance,
and communicated it to Strap, who skipped about
for joy, I dispatched him with it to the place appointed,
which was the house of a milliner not
far from Bond-street, and desired him to keep
watch near the door for some time, that he might
discover the person who would call for it. — 
In less than an hour he returned, with a joyful
countenance, and told me, that soon after he
had delivered the letter a chairman was called,
to whom it was given, with directions to carry
it to the house of a rich gentleman in the
neighbourhood, whither he (Strap) followed him,
and saw it put into the hands of a waiting-woman,
who paid the messenger and shut the
door; —That upon inquiry at an ale-house hard
by, where he called for a pint of beer, he understood,
that the gentleman to whom the house belonged
had an only daughter, very handsome,
who would inherit his whole estate; and who
certainly was the author of the billet I had received. 
—I was of the same opinion, and huging
myself in the happy prospect, dressed immediately,
and passed in great state by the house
that contained my unknown admirer. —Nor was
my vanity disappointed; for I perceived a beautiful
young creature standing at one of the windows of
the dining-room, who, I imagined, observed me
with more than common curiosity. That I might
indulge her view, and at the same time feast my
own, I affected to stop, and give orders to Strap; 
in the street, just opposite to her station, by
which means I had an opportunity of seeing her
more distinctly, and of congratulating myself on
having made a conquest of so much perfection. 

—In a few moments she retired, and I betook
myself to the ordinary, in a rapture of hope, which
deprived me of my appetite for that meal, and
sent me home in the evening to indulge my contemplation. 
Early next day, I was favoured with another
epistle from my unknown charmer, signifying her
unutterable joy at the receipt of mine, which,
while it made a tender of my heart, convinced
her of the value of it. Above all things, she
professed extreme pleasure in finding me so much
attached to her understanding, a circumstance
that not only flattered her in the most sensible part,
but at the same time argued my own sagacity. —As
for the interview I desired, she assured me, that
I could not be more eager for such an occasion
than she; but she must not only sacrifice a little
more to decorum, but be satisfied of my honourable
intentions, before she would grant that
request: Mean while, she gave me to understand,
that although she might owe some deference to
the opinion of certain persons, she was resolved,
in an affair that so nearly concerned her happiness,
to consult her own inclination, preferably to the
advice of the whole world; especially, as she
was urged to such condescension by no consideration
of fortune, what she depended upon, being
her own without restriction or controul. — 
Struck with admiration at the philosophy and self-denial
of my mistress, who seemed insensible of
the beauty she possessed; and in particular, ravished
with that piece of intelligence, by which
I learned her fortune was independent, I resumed
the pen, launched out into encomiums on the
dignity of her sentiments, affected to under-value
the charms of external beauty, pretended to 

ground my passion on the qualities of her mind; 
complained of her rigour, in sacrificing my repose
to an overscrupulous regard to decorum,
and declared the purity of my designs in the most
solemn and pathetic vows. —This performance
being sealed and directed, was sent to the place
appointed, by Strap, who, that we might be still
the more confirmed in our belief, renewed his
watch, and in a little time brought back the
same information as before, with this addition,
that Miss Sparkle, (the name of my supposed correspondent)
looking out at the window, no sooner
saw the messenger arrive, than she shut the casement
in a sort of beautiful confusion, and disappeared; 
eager, no doubt, to hear from the dear
object of her love. 
My doubts now vanished, the long expected
port appeared, and I looked upon myself as perfectly
secure of that happiness I had been in quest
of so long. —After dinner, I sauntered in company
with doctor Wagtail, to that part of the
town in which my inamorata lived; and as he
was a meer register, enquired of him into the
name, character and fortune of every body who
possessed a good house in the streets through which
we passed: When it came to his turn to mention
Sir John Sparkle, he represented him as a man
of an immense estate and narrow disposition, who
mewed up his only child, a fine young lady,
from the conversation of mankind, under the
strict watch and inspection of an old gouvernante,
who was either so honest, envious or insatiable,
that no body had been, as yet, able to make her a
friend, or get access to her charge, though numbers
attempted it every day; not so much on
account of her expectations from her father, 

who being a widower, might marry again, and
have sons, as for a fortune of twelve thousand
pounds left her by an uncle, of which she could
not be deprived. —This piece of news exactly
tallying with the last part of the letter I had
been honoured with in the morning, had such an
effect on me, that any man, except Wagtail,
might have observed my emotion; but his attention
was too much engrossed on the contemplation
of his own importance, to be affected with
the deportment of any other body, unless it
happened to be so particular, that he could not
help taking notice of it. 
When I had disengaged myself from him,
whose conversation grew insipid to me, I went
home, and made Strap acquainted with the fruits
of my researches. —This faithful Squire was almost
choaked with transport, and even wept for
joy; but whether on account of himself or me,
I shall not pretend to determine. —Next day a
third billet doux was brought to me, containing
many expressions of tenderness, mingled with
some affecting doubts about the artifice of man,
the inconstancy of youth, and the jealously often
attending the most sincere passion; withal desiring
I would excuse her, if she should try me a little
longer, before she declared herself beyond the
power of retracting. —These interesting scruples
added fuel to my flame, and impatience to my
hope; I redoubled my complaints of her indifference,
and pressed her to an assignation, with
such fervid intreaties, that in a few days, she
consented to meet me at the house of that milliner,
who had forwarded all my letters. —During
the interval between the date of her promise,
and the hour of appointment, my pride soared 

beyond all reason and description; I lost all remembrance
of the gentle Narcissa, and my
thoughts were wholly employed in planning
triumphs over the malice and contempt of the
world. 
At length the happy hour arrived, I flew to
the place of rendezvous, and was conducted into
an apartment, where I had not waited ten minutes,
when I heard the rustling of silk and the
found of feet ascending the stairs: My heart
took the alarm, and beat quick, my cheeks
glowed, my nerves thrilled, and my knees shook
with exstasy! I perceived the door opening, saw
a gold brocade petticoat advance, and sprung forward
to embrace my charmer. —Heaven and
earth! how shall I paint my situation, when I
found Miss Sparkle converted into a wrinkled
hag turned of seventy! I was struck dumb with
amazement, and petrified with horror! This
ancient urganda perceived my disorder, and approaching
with a languishing air, seized my hand,
asking in a squeaking tone, if I was indisposed. 
—Her monstrous affectation compleated the disgust
I had conceived for her at her first appearance; 
and it was a long time before I could command
myself so much, as to behave with common
civility: At length, however, I recollected
myself and pronounced an apology for my behaviour,
which, I said, proceeded from a dizziness
that seized me all of a sudden. —My hoary
Dulcinea, who, no doubt, had been alarmed at
my confusion, no sooner learned the cause to
which I now ascribed it, than she discovered
her joy in a thousand amorous coquettries, and
assumed the sprightly arts of a girl of sixteen. 
One while, she ogled me with her dim eyes, 

quenched in rheum; then, as if she was ashamed
of that freedom, she affected to look down,
blush, and play with her fan, then toss her head
that I might not perceive a palsy that shook it,
ask some childish questions with a lisping accent,
giggle and grin with her mouth shut, to conceal
the ravages of time upon her teeth, leer upon
me again, sigh piteously, fling herself about in
her chair to shew her agility, and act a great many
more absurdities that youth and beauty can
alone excuse. —Shocked as I was at my disappointment,
my disposition was incapable of affronting
any person who loved me; I therefore endeavoured
to put a good face on the matter for
the present, resolved to drop the whole affair as
soon as I should get clear of her company; with
this view, I uttered some civil things, and in particular
desired to know the name and condition
of the lady who had honoured me so much. — 
She told me her name was Withers, that she
lived with Sir John Sparkle in quality of governess
to his only daughter, in which situation
she had picked up a comfortable sufficiency to
make her easy for life; that she had the pleasure
of seeing me at church, where my appearance
and deportment made such an impression upon
her heart, that she could enjoy no ease until she
had inquired into my character, which she found
so amiable in all respects, that she yielded to
the violence of her inclination, and ventured to
declare her passion, with too little regard, perhaps,
to the decorum of her sex; but she hoped
I would forgive a trespass, of which I myself
was, in some measure, the cause, and impute
her intrusion to the irresistible dictates of love. — 
No decayed rake ever swallowed a bolus with 

more reluctance than I felt in making a reply
suitable to the compliment, when instead of the
jewel, I found the crazy casket only in my
power; and yet my hopes began to revive a
little, when I considered, that by carrying on the
appearance of an intrigue with the Duenna, I might
possibly get access to her charge. Encouraged by this
suggestion, my temper grew more serene, my
reserve wore off, I talked en cavalier, and even
made love to this antiquated coquette, who
seemed extremely happy in her adorer, and spread
all her allurements to make her imagined conquest
more secure. —The good woman of the
house treated us with tea and sweet-meats, and
afterwards withdrew, like a civil experienced matron
as she was. —Left thus to our mutual endearments,
Miss Withers (for she was still a
maiden) began to talk of matrimony, and expressed
so much impatience in all her behaviour,
that, had she been fifty years younger, I might
possibly have gratified her longing without having
recourse to the church; but this my virtue as well
as interest forbad. When the inclinations of an
old maid settle upon a young fellow, he is persecuted
with her addresses; but, should he once
grant her the favour, he will never be able to
disentangle himself from her importunities and
reproaches. It was my business to defer the
ceremony as long as possible under the most
specious pretences, with a view of becoming acquainted
with Miss Sparkle, in the mean time; 
and I did not despair of success, when I considered,
that in the course of our correspondence
I would, in all probability, be invited to visit my
mistress in her own apartment, and by that
means have an opportunity of conversing with 

her charming ward. Pleased with this prospect,
my heart dilated with joy, I talked in raptures to
the stale gouvernante, and kissed her shriveled
hand with great devotion: She was so much
transported with her good fortune, that she could
not contain her exstasy, but flew upon me like
a tygeress, and pressed her skinny lips to mine; 
when (as it was no doubt concerted by her evil
genius) a dose of garlick she had swallowed that
morning, to dispel wind I suppose, began to operate
with such a sudden explosion, that human
nature, circumstanced as I was, could not endure
the shock with any degree of temper. —I lost all
patience and reflection, flung away from her in
an instant, snatched my hat and cane, and run
down stairs as the devil had me in pursuit, and
could scarce restrain the convulsion of my bowels,
which were grievously offended by the perfume
that assaulted me. —Strap, who waited my return
with impatience, seeing me arrive in the utmost
disorder, stood motionless with apprehension, and
durst not enquire into the cause. 
After I had washed my mouth more than once,
and recruited my spirits with a glass of wine, I
recounted to him every particular of what had
happened; to which he made no other reply, for
some time, than lifting up his eyes, clasping his
hands, and uttering a hollow groan. —At length
he observed, in a melancholy tone, that it was
a thousand pities my organs were so delicate as
to be offended with the smell of garlick: “Ah!
God help us (said he) 'tis not the steams of
garlick, no, nor of something else, that
would give me the least uneasiness—see
what it is to be a cobler's son.” —I replied
hastily, “I wish then, you would go and retrieve 

my miscarriage.” —At this he started,
forced a smile, and left the room, shaking his
head. Whether the old gentlewoman resented my
abrupt departure so much, that her love changed
into disdain, or was ashamed to see me on account
of her infirmity, I know not, but I was never
troubled again with her passion.
