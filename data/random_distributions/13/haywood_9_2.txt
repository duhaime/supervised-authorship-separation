May more properly be called an introduction to the ensuing history, than a part of it. 
Jemmy and Jenny Jessamy, were originally discended from two male branches of the same Family, as it may be reasonably supposed, they both being of the same name, and having the same escutchion;—but to trace how far the relationship between them was removed, would require much time and trouble in examining old records, memorandums, and church registers, and cost more than the acquisition would be worth, as it could not be found any way material to the history. 
It shall therefore suffice to say, that Jemmy was the only son of a gentleman of a competent estate, and Jenny sole daughter and heiress of a wealthy merchant;—that their parents had always called cousins,—had lived with each other in the most perfect friendship, the tokens of which each seemed equally desirous should continue beyond the grave; and, to this end, resolved on a marriage between their children, provided that when they arrived at years of maturity, neither of them should have any objection to such an union. 
As this agreement was very early made, and the accomplishment of it was seriously wished for by both parties, all imaginable care was taken to excite in the children a mutual affection for each other, and to make the name of love familiar to them long before they knew what was meant by the words, much less could have any notion of the passion,—depending on this maxim of the poet: 
Children, like tender oziers, take the bow,
And as they first are fashon'd, still will grow.
Jemmy, who had four years the advantage of Jenny, was taught to call her his little wife, even while in her cradle, and Jenny no sooner began to speak than she was made to say she loved her husband Jemmy in her heart. 
As their years increas'd, and they became capable of receiving the first rudiments of education befitting their different sexes, Jemmy was sent to Eton, and Jenny to a boarding-school at a small village not far from London; but to attone for this separation, they were instructed, by those who had the care of them, to write little epistles to each other, which they dictated in terms suitable to their age and innocence, and served to keep alive that spirit of affection, which had been inculcated in their more early infancy. —When the times of breaking up allowed them to return to their friends, they were seldom asunder,—they partook together all those diversions prepared for them by their indulgent parents, and sometimes Jemmy, and sometimes Jenny, were at the head of the feast,—all others being but their invited guests. —Jemmy was continually presenting Jenny with some curious new invented toy, and the first fruits of Jenny's handy work, was a fine embroider'd waistcoat and cap for Jemmy. 
By this means it became a kind of second nature in them to love each other, the affection they began in infancy, grew up with their years; and if what they felt as they approach'd nearer to maturity did not amount to a passion, it was at least somewhat more than is ordinarily found between a brother and a sister. 
The two fathers, however, were highly contented with the effect their endeavours had produced in the hearts of their children, and doubted not but by the prudent measures had been taken in the education of both, they should one day see them make very shining figures in the state of marriage, which they resolved should be delayed no longer than till Jemmy had arrived at the age of one and twenty, at which time Jenny would be some months past seventeen. 
But how uncertain is life!—how fallible the prospects it presents!—it often happens that when they seem most near, they either vanish of themselves, or we are suddenly snatch'd from them:—the father of Jenny, though a man whose healthy constitution, according to all appearance, promised a much longer date, died in an apoplectic fit, and she became an orphan three years before the time prefix'd for the completion of her marriage. 
This fatal accident must necessarily involve the tender and affectionate heart of this young girl in very great affliction; but it was less severely felt, as she had always been bred to look on the father of Jemmy as a second parent to herself;—she, therefore, hesitated not to commit the large fortune she was left mistress of entirely to his care, and chose him for her guardian, according to the forms of law. 
Soon after her father's death, finding she had attain'd all those accomplishments that could be taught her in a boarding-school, she removed from thence, and with the approbation of her guardian, went to live with a family where she had a much better opportunity of seeing the world, and knowing how to conform herself to the customs and manners of it, than ever she could have done by the precise rules observed in the place she came from. 
Jemmy had some time before left Eton, and was gone to Oxford, in order to finish his studies; but he obtain'd leave from the head of the college to make frequent visits to London,—induced thereto, by the double obligation of testifying his duty to his father, and affection to his mistress;—to these two motives, a third, perhaps, might be added, equally prevalent with either of the former,—that of partaking the pleasures of the town, of which he was no less fond, than most others of his sex and age. 
He was but just return'd to the university, from whence he had made a pretty long excursion, when he was suddenly recall'd to London: —The old gentleman was seiz'd with a pluretic fever, which, notwithstanding all the remedies proper in such cases were apply'd, made so swift a progress towards his heart, as threaten'd an immediate dissolution;—it indeed proved so, for tho' Jemmy, on the melancholy news, took horse the same moment, and rode post to town, he arrived but just time enough to see this best of fathers breath his last. 
The pangs of death were on him, yet were his senses perfect;—on his son's approach, a gleam of satisfaction diffused itself through all his late disordered features;—he collected all the strength that was left in him to raise himself a little, and taking hold of Jemmy's hand, and joining it to that of Jenny's, who sat weeping by the bed side,—‘My dear children, said he, I regret the loss of life for nothing so much as because I shall be deprived of seeing that happiness, which I hope you will soon enjoy together;’—he would have added something more, but his voice forsook him, and he expired that instant. 
Few young heirs look upon any thing as a real matter of affliction, which makes them masters of themselves and fortunes; but Jemmy was of a different way of thinking, he had a great share both of good sense and good nature; and besides what filial duty demanded from him, love and gratitude for the indulgence with which he had always been treated by his father, made him lament his loss with the most unfeign'd and poignant sorrow. 
Jenny was also very deeply affected at this event; she had been truly sensible of the value she ought to set upon so faithful a guardian, and so sincere a friend; and while she used her endeavours to give his son some consolation, stood in almost equal need of receiving it herself. 
The prudent old gentleman, tho' perhaps without any apprehensions of being so near his end, had some months before made his will, by which it appeared, on examination, that he had appointed trustees to manage both for his son and intended daughter-in-law, in case he should die before they arrived at the age of acting for themselves, and also, that by his great economy, he had saved out of the receipts of his estates several considerable sums of money, which he had placed in the publick funds,—so that Jemmy found himself in possession of a much larger fortune than he had imagined, or had been made to hope for. 
Soon after the melancholy solemnity of the funeral was over, he returned to Oxford; but stay'd no longer there than was necessary to take a decent leave of the gentlemen of the college, and other students with whom he had contracted the most intimacy. 
But none of his friends or acquaintance, either wonder'd at, or condemned the haste he made to quit the university, not doubting but the sole motive of his doing so was the laudable affection for the lady intended to be his future bride.
