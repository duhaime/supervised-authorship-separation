Dear Pamela,
I Cannot but renew my Cautions to you on your
Master's Kindness to you, and his free Expression
to you about the Stockens. Yet there may not be, 

and I hope there is not, any thing in it. But when I
reflect, that there possibly may, and that if there
should, no less depends upon it than my Child's everlasting
Happiness in this World and the next; it is
enough to make one fearful of the worst. Arm yourself,
my dear Child, for the worst; and resolve to
lose your Life sooner than your Virtue. What tho'
the Doubts I fill'd you with, lessen the Pleasure you
would have had in your Master's Kindness, yet what
signify the Delights that arise from a few paltry fine
Cloaths, in Comparison with a good Conscience? 
These are indeed very great Favours that he heaps
upon you, but so much the more to be suspected; 
and when you say he look'd so amiable, and like an
Angel, how afraid I am, that they should make too
great an Impression upon you! For, tho' God has
bless'd you with Sense and Prudence above your Years,
yet, I tremble to think what a sad Hazard a poor
Maiden of no more than Fifteen Years of Age stands
against the Temptations of this World, and a designing
young Gentleman, if he should prove so, who
has so much Power to oblige, and has a kind of
Authority to command as your Master. 
I charge you, my dear Child, on both our Blessings,
poor as we are, to be on your Guard; there can be
no Harm in that: and since Mrs. Jervis is so good
a Gentlewoman, and so kind to you, I am the easier
a great deal, and so is your Mother; and we hope
you will hide nothing from her, and take her Counsel
in every thing. So with our Blessings and assured
Prayers for you, more than for ourselves, we remain 
Your loving Father and Mother. 
Besure don't let People's telling you you are pretty,
puff you up: for you did not make yourself, and 

so can have no Praise due to you for it. It is
Virtue and Goodness only, that make the true
Beauty. Remember that, Pamela.
