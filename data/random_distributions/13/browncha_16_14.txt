I was arou&longs;ed from this &longs;tupor by &longs;ounds that
evidently aro&longs;e in the next chamber. Was it possible
that I had been mi&longs;taken in the figure which
I had &longs;een on the bank? or had Carwin, by &longs;ome
in&longs;crutable means, penetrated once more into this
chamber? The oppo&longs;ite door opened; foot&longs;teps
came forth, and the per&longs;on, advancing to mine,
knocked.
So unexpected an incident robbed me of all presence
of mind, and, &longs;tarting up, I involuntarily exclaimed,
“Who is there?” An an&longs;wer was immediately
given. The voice, to my inexpre&longs;&longs;ible
a&longs;toni&longs;hment, was Pleyel's.
“It is I. Have you ri&longs;en? If you have not,
make ha&longs;te; I want three minutes conver&longs;ation with
you in the parlour—I will wait for you there.”
Saying this he retired from the door.
Should I confide in the te&longs;timony of my ears?
If that were true, it was Pleyel that had been hitherto
immured in the oppo&longs;ite chamber: he whom
my rueful fancy had depicted in &longs;o many ruinous
and gha&longs;tly &longs;hapes: he who&longs;e foot&longs;teps had been
li&longs;tened to with &longs;uch inquietude! What is man,
that knowledge is &longs;o &longs;paringly conferred upon him!
that his heart &longs;hould be wrung with di&longs;tre&longs;s, and
his frame be exanimated with fear, though his &longs;afety
be encompa&longs;&longs;ed with impregnable walls! What
are the bounds of human imbecility! He that
warned me of the pre&longs;ence of my foe refu&longs;ed the
intimation by which &longs;o many racking fears would
have been precluded.






Yet who would have imagined the arrival of
Pleyel at &longs;uch an hour? His tone was de&longs;ponding
and anxious. Why this un&longs;ea&longs;onable &longs;ummons?
and why this ha&longs;ty departure? Some tidings he,
perhaps, bears of my&longs;terious and unwelcome import.

My impatience would not allow me to con&longs;ume
much time in deliberation: I ha&longs;tened down. Pleyel
I found &longs;tanding at a window, with eyes ca&longs;t down
as in meditation, and arms folded on his brea&longs;t.
Every line in his countenance was pregnant with
&longs;orrow. To this was added a certain wanne&longs;s and
air of fatigue. The la&longs;t time I had &longs;een him appearances
had been the rever&longs;e of the&longs;e. I was
&longs;tartled at the change. The fir&longs;t impul&longs;e was to
que&longs;tion him as to the cau&longs;e. This impul&longs;e was supplanted
by &longs;ome degree of confu&longs;ion, flowing from
a con&longs;ciou&longs;ne&longs;s that love had too large, and, as it
might prove, a perceptible &longs;hare in creating this impulse.
I was &longs;ilent.
Pre&longs;ently he rai&longs;ed his eyes and fixed them upon
me. I read in them an angui&longs;h altogether ineffable.
Never had I witne&longs;&longs;ed a like demeanour in
Pleyel. Never, indeed, had I ob&longs;erved an human
countenance in which grief was more legibly inscribed.
He &longs;eemed &longs;truggling for utterance; but
his &longs;truggles being fruitle&longs;s, he &longs;hook his head and
turned away from me.
My impatience would not allow me to be longer
&longs;ilent: “What,” &longs;aid I, “for heaven's &longs;ake, my
friend, what is the matter?”
He &longs;tarted at the &longs;ound of my voice. His looks,
for a moment, became convul&longs;ed with an emotion
very different from grief. His accents were broken
with rage.
“The matter—O wretch!—thus exqui&longs;itely





fa&longs;hioned—on whom nature &longs;eemed to have exhausted
all her graces; with charms &longs;o awful and &longs;o
pure! how art thou fallen! From what height
fallen! A ruin &longs;o complete—&longs;o unheard of!”
His words were again choaked by emotion.
Grief and pity were again mingled in his features.
He re&longs;umed, in a tone half &longs;uffocated by &longs;obs:
“But why &longs;hould I upbraid thee? Could I restore
to thee what thou ha&longs;t lo&longs;t; efface this
cur&longs;ed &longs;tain; &longs;natch thee from the jaws of this fiend;
I would do it. Yet what will avail my efforts?
I have not arms with which to contend with &longs;o consummate,
&longs;o frightful a depravity.
“Evidence le&longs;s than this would only have excited
re&longs;entment and &longs;corn. The wretch who &longs;hould
have breathed a &longs;u&longs;picion injurious to thy honor,
would have been regarded without anger; not
hatred or envy could have prompted him; it would
merely be an argument of madne&longs;s. That my eyes,
that my ears, &longs;hould bear witne&longs;s to thy fall! By
no other way could dete&longs;tible conviction be imparted.

“Why do I &longs;ummon thee to this conference?
Why expo&longs;e my&longs;elf to thy deri&longs;ion? Here admonition
and entreaty are vain. Thou knowe&longs;t him
already, for a murderer and thief. I had thought
to have been the fir&longs;t to di&longs;clo&longs;e to thee his in&longs;amy;
to have warned thee of the pit to which thou art
ha&longs;tening; but thy eyes are open in vain. O &longs;oul
and in&longs;upportable di&longs;grace!
“There is but one path. I know you will disappear
together. In thy ruin, how will the &longs;elicity
and honor of multitudes be involved! But it mu&longs;t
come. This &longs;cene &longs;hall not be blotted by his presence.
No doubt thou wilt &longs;hortly &longs;ee thy dete&longs;ted
paramour. This &longs;cene will be again polluted by




a midnight a&longs;&longs;ignation. Inform him of his danger;
tell him that his crimes are known; let him fly
far and in&longs;tantly from this &longs;pot, if he de&longs;ires to
avoid the fate which menaced him in Ireland.
“And wilt thou not &longs;tay behind?—But &longs;hame
upon my weakne&longs;s. I know not what I would
&longs;ay.—I have done what I purpo&longs;ed. To &longs;tay
longer, to expo&longs;tulate, to be&longs;eech, to enumerate
the con&longs;equences of thy act—what end can it
&longs;erve but to blazon thy infamy and embitter our
woes? And yet, O think, think ere it be too late,
on the di&longs;tre&longs;&longs;es which thy flight will entail upon
us; on the ba&longs;e, grovelling, and atrocious character
of the wretch to whom thou ha&longs;t &longs;old thy
honor. But what is this? Is not thy effrontery
impenetrable, and thy heart thoroughly cankered?
O mo&longs;t &longs;pecious, and mo&longs;t profligate of women!”
Saying this, he ru&longs;hed out of the hou&longs;e. I &longs;aw
him in a few moments hurrying along the path
which led to my brother's. I had no power to
prevent his going, or to recall, or to follow him.
The accents I had heard were calculated to
confound and bewilder. I looked around me to
a&longs;&longs;ure my&longs;elf that the &longs;cene was real. I moved
that I might bani&longs;h the doubt that I was awake.
Such enormous imputations from the mouth of
Pleyel! To be &longs;tigmatized with the names of
wanton and profligate! To be charged with the
&longs;acrifice of honor! with midnight meetings with a
wretch known to be a murderer and thief! with an
intention to fly in his company!
What I had heard was &longs;urely the dictate of
phrenzy, or it was built upon &longs;ome fatal, &longs;ome incomprehensible
mi&longs;take. After the horrors of the
night; after undergoing perils &longs;o imminent from
this man, to be &longs;ummoned to an interview like this;




to find Pleyel fraught with a belief that, in&longs;tead
of having cho&longs;en death as a refuge from the violence
of this man, I had hugged his ba&longs;ene&longs;s to my
heart, had &longs;acrificed for him my purity, my &longs;potle&longs;s
name, my friend&longs;hips, and my fortune! that even
madne&longs;s could engender accu&longs;ations like the&longs;e was
not to be believed.
What evidence could po&longs;&longs;ibly &longs;ugge&longs;t conceptions
&longs;o wild? After the unlooked-for interview
with Carwin in my chamber, he retired. Could
Pleyel have ob&longs;erved his exit? It was not long
after that Pleyel him&longs;elf entered. Did he build on
this incident, his odious conclu&longs;ions? Could the
long &longs;eries of my actions and &longs;entiments grant me
no exemption from &longs;u&longs;picions &longs;o foul? Was it
not more rational to infer that Carwin's de&longs;igns
had been illicit; that my life had been endangered
by the fury of one whom, by &longs;ome means, he had
di&longs;covered to be an a&longs;&longs;a&longs;&longs;in and robber; that
my honor had been a&longs;&longs;ailed, not by blandi&longs;hments,
but by violence?
He has judged me without hearing. He has
drawn from dubious appearances, conclu&longs;ions the
mo&longs;t improbable and unju&longs;t. He has loaded me
with all outrageous epithets. He has ranked me
with pro&longs;titutes and thieves. I cannot pardon thee.
Pleyel, for this inju&longs;tice. Thy under&longs;tanding mu&longs;t
be hurt. If it be not, if thy conduct was &longs;ober
and deliberate, I can never forgive an outrage &longs;o
unmanly, and &longs;o gro&longs;s.
The&longs;e thoughts gradually gave place to others.
Pleyel was po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;ed by &longs;ome momentary phrenzy:
appearances had led him into palpable errors.
Whence could his &longs;agacity have contracted this
blindne&longs;s? Was it not love? Previou&longs;ly a&longs;&longs;ured of
my affection for Carwin, di&longs;tracted with grief and




jealou&longs;y, and impelled hither at that late hour by
&longs;ome unknown in&longs;tigation, his imagination transformed
&longs;hadows into mon&longs;ters, and plunged him
into the&longs;e deplorable errors.
This idea was not unattended with con&longs;olation.
My &longs;oul was divided between indignation at his injustice,
and delight on account of the &longs;ource from
which I conceived it to &longs;pring. For a long time
they would allow admi&longs;&longs;ion to no other thoughts.
Surprize is an emotion that enfeebles, not invigorates.
All my meditations were accompanied with
wonder. I rambled with vaguene&longs;s, or clung to
one image with an ob&longs;tinacy which &longs;ufficiently testified
the maddening influence of late tran&longs;actions.
Gradually I proceeded to reflect upon the consequences
of Pleyel's mi&longs;take, and on the mea&longs;ures
I &longs;hould take to guard my&longs;elf again&longs;t future injury
from Carwin. Should I &longs;uffer this mi&longs;take to be
detected by time? When his pa&longs;&longs;ion &longs;hould subside,
would he not perceive the flagrancy of his injustice,
and ha&longs;ten to atone for it? Did it not become
my character to te&longs;tify re&longs;entment for language
and treatment &longs;o opprobrious? Wrapt up in
the con&longs;ciou&longs;ne&longs;s of innocence, and confiding in
the influence of time and reflection to con&longs;ute &longs;o
groundle&longs;s a charge, it was my province to be passive
and &longs;ilent.
As to the violences meditated by Carwin, and
the means of eluding them, the path to be taken by
me was obvious. I re&longs;olved to tell the tale to my
brother, and regulate my&longs;elf by his advice. For
this end, when the morning was &longs;omewhat advanced,
I took the way to his hou&longs;e. My &longs;i&longs;ter was
engaged in her cu&longs;tomary occupations. As &longs;oon
as I appeared, &longs;he remarked a change in my looks.
I was not willing to alarm her by the information




which I had to communicate. Her health was in
that condition which rendered a di&longs;a&longs;trous tale particularly
un&longs;uitable. I forbore a direct an&longs;wer to
her inquiries, and inquired, in my turn, for Wieland.

“Why,” &longs;aid &longs;he, “I &longs;u&longs;pect &longs;omething mysterious
and unplea&longs;ant has happened this morning.
Scarcely had we ri&longs;en when Pleyel dropped among
us. What could have prompted him to make us
&longs;o early and &longs;o un&longs;ea&longs;onable a vi&longs;it I cannot tell.
To judge from the di&longs;order of his dre&longs;s, and his
countenance, &longs;omething of an extraordinary nature
has occurred. He permitted me merely to know
that he had &longs;lept none, nor even undre&longs;&longs;ed, during
the pa&longs;t night. He took your brother to walk with
him. Some topic mu&longs;t have deeply engaged them,
for Wieland did not return till the breakfa&longs;t hour
was pa&longs;&longs;ed, and returned alone. His di&longs;turbance
was exce&longs;&longs;ive; but he would not li&longs;ten to my importunities,
or tell me what had happened. I gathered
from hints which he let fall, that your situation
was, in &longs;ome way, the cau&longs;e: yet he a&longs;&longs;ured
me that you were at your own hou&longs;e, alive, in good
health, and in perfect &longs;afety. He &longs;carcely ate a
mor&longs;el, and immediately after breakfa&longs;t went out
again. He would not inform me whither he was
going, but mentioned that he probably might not
return before night.”
I was equally a&longs;toni&longs;hed and alarmed by this information.
Pleyel had told his tale to my brother,
and had, by a plau&longs;ible and exaggerated picture,
in&longs;tilled into him unfavorable thoughts of me. Yet
would not the more correct judgment of Wieland
perceive and expo&longs;e the fallacy of his conclu&longs;ions?
Perhaps his unea&longs;ine&longs;s might ari&longs;e from &longs;ome insight
into the character of Carwin, and from




apprehensions for my &longs;afety. The appearances by
which Pleyel had been mi&longs;led, might induce him
likewi&longs;e to believe that I entertained an indi&longs;creet,
though not di&longs;honorable affection for Carwin.
Such were the conjectures rapidly formed. I was
inexpre&longs;&longs;ibly anxious to change them into certainty.
For this end an interview with my brother was
de&longs;irable. He was gone, no one knew whither,
and was not expected &longs;peedily to return. I had no
clue by which to trace his foot&longs;teps.
My anxieties could not be concealed from my
&longs;i&longs;ter. They heightened her &longs;olicitude to be acquainted
with the cau&longs;e. There were many reasons
per&longs;uading me to &longs;ilence: at lea&longs;t, till I had
&longs;een my brother, it would be an act of inexcu&longs;able
temerity to unfold what had lately pa&longs;&longs;ed. No
other expedient for eluding her importunities occurred
to me, but that of returning to my own
hou&longs;e. I recollected my determination to become
a tenant of this roof. I mentioned it to her. She
joyfully acceded to this propo&longs;al, and &longs;uffered me,
with le&longs;s reluctance, to depart, when I told her that
it was with a view to collect and &longs;end to my new
dwelling what articles would be immediately u&longs;eful
to me.
Once more I returned to the hou&longs;e which had
been the &longs;cene of &longs;o much turbulence and danger.
I was at no great di&longs;tance from it when I ob&longs;erved
my brother coming out. On &longs;eeing me he &longs;topped,
and after a&longs;certaining, as it &longs;eemed, which way I
was going, he returned into the hou&longs;e before me.
I &longs;incerely rejoiced at this event, and I ha&longs;tened to
&longs;et things, if po&longs;&longs;ible, on their right footing.
His brow was by no means expre&longs;&longs;ive of tho&longs;e
vehement emotions with which Pleyel had been
agitated. I drew a favorable omen from this




circumstance. Without delay I began the conversation.

“I have been to look for you,” &longs;aid I, “but
was told by Catharine that Pleyel had engaged you
on &longs;ome important and di&longs;agreeable affair. Before
his interview with you he &longs;pent a few minutes with
me. The&longs;e minutes he employed in upbraiding me
for crimes and intentions with which I am by no
means chargeable. I believe him to have taken up
his opinions on very in&longs;ufficient grounds. His behaviour
was in the highe&longs;t degree precipitate and
unju&longs;t, and, until I receive &longs;ome atonement, I &longs;hall
treat him, in my turn, with that contempt which
he ju&longs;tly merits: meanwhile I am fearful that he
has prejudiced my brother again&longs;t me. That is an
evil which I mo&longs;t anxiou&longs;ly deprecate, and which I
&longs;hall indeed exert my&longs;elf to remove. Has he made
me the &longs;ubject of this morning's conver&longs;ation?”
My brother's countenance te&longs;tified no &longs;urprize
at my addre&longs;s. The benignity of his looks were
no wife dimini&longs;hed.
“It is true,” &longs;aid he, “your conduct was the
&longs;ubject of our di&longs;cour&longs;e. I am your friend, as well
as your brother. There is no human being whom
I love with more tenderne&longs;s, and who&longs;e welfare is
nearer my heart. Judge then with what emotions
I li&longs;tened to Pleyel's &longs;tory. I expect and de&longs;ire
you to vindicate your&longs;elf from a&longs;per&longs;ions &longs;o &longs;oul,
if vindication be po&longs;&longs;ible.”
The tone with which he uttered the la&longs;t words
affected me deeply. “If vindication be po&longs;&longs;ible!”
repeated I. “From what you know, do you deem
a formal vindication nece&longs;&longs;ary? Can you harbour
for a moment the belief of my guilt?”
He &longs;hook his head with an air of acute angui&longs;h.
“I have &longs;truggled,” &longs;aid he, “to di&longs;mi&longs;s that




belief. You &longs;peak before a judge who will profit by
any pretence to acquit you: who is ready to question
his own &longs;en&longs;es when they plead again&longs;t you.”
The&longs;e words incited a new &longs;et of thoughts in my
mind. I began to &longs;u&longs;pect that Pleyel had built his
accu&longs;ations on &longs;ome foundation unknown to me.
“I may be a &longs;tranger to the grounds of your belief.
Pleyel loaded me with indecent and virulent invectives,
but he withheld from me the facts that
generated his &longs;u&longs;picions. Events took place la&longs;t
night of which &longs;ome of the circum&longs;tances were of
an ambiguous nature. I conceived that the&longs;e might
po&longs;&longs;ibly have fallen under his cognizance, and that,
viewed through the mi&longs;ts of prejudice and pa&longs;&longs;ion,
they &longs;upplied a pretence for his conduct, but believed
that your more unbia&longs;&longs;ed judgment would
e&longs;timate them at their ju&longs;t value. Perhaps his tale
has been different from what I &longs;u&longs;pect it to be.
Li&longs;ten then to my narrative. If there be any thing
in his &longs;tory incon&longs;i&longs;tent with mine, his &longs;tory is
fal&longs;e.”
I then proceeded to a circum&longs;tantial relation of
the incidents of the la&longs;t night. Wieland li&longs;tened
with deep attention. Having fini&longs;hed, “This,”
continued I, “is the truth; you &longs;ee in what circumstances
an interview took place between Carwin
and me. He remained for hours in my clo&longs;et,
and for &longs;ome minutes in my chamber. He departed
without ha&longs;te or interruption. If Pleyel
marked him as he left the hou&longs;e, and it is not impossible
that he did, inferences injurious to my
character might &longs;ugge&longs;t them&longs;elves to him. In admitting
them, he gave proofs of le&longs;s di&longs;cernment and
le&longs;s candor than I once a&longs;cribed to him.”
“His proofs,” &longs;aid Wieland, after a considerable
pau&longs;e, “are different. That he &longs;hould be





deceived, is not po&longs;&longs;ible. That he him&longs;elf is not
the deceiver, could not be believed, if his te&longs;timony
were not incon&longs;i&longs;tent with yours; but the doubts
which I entertained are now removed. Your tale,
&longs;ome parts of it, is marvellous; the voice which
exclaimed again&longs;t your ra&longs;hne&longs;s in approaching the
clo&longs;et, your per&longs;i&longs;ting notwith&longs;tanding that prohibition,
your belief that I was the ruffian, and your
&longs;ub&longs;equent conduct, are believed by me, becau&longs;e I
have known you from childhood, becau&longs;e a thousand
in&longs;tances have atte&longs;ted your veracity, and because
nothing le&longs;s than my own hearing and vi&longs;ion
would convince me, in oppo&longs;ition to her own assertions,
that my &longs;i&longs;ter had fallen into wickedne&longs;s like
this.”
I threw my arms around him, and bathed his
cheek with my tears. “That,” &longs;aid I, “is &longs;poken
like my brother. But what are the proofs?”
He replied—“Pleyel informed me that, in going
to your hou&longs;e, his attention was attracted by two
voices. The per&longs;ons &longs;peaking &longs;at beneath the
bank out of &longs;ight. The&longs;e per&longs;ons, judging by their
voices, were Carwin and you. I will not repeat
the dialogue. If my &longs;i&longs;ter was the female, Pleyel
was ju&longs;tified in concluding you to be, indeed, one
of the mo&longs;t profligate of women. Hence, his accusations
of you, and his efforts to obtain my concurrence
to a plan by which an eternal &longs;eparation
&longs;hould be brought about between my &longs;i&longs;ter and this
man.”
I made Wieland repeat this recital. Here, indeed,
was a tale to fill me with terrible foreboding.
I had vainly thought that my &longs;afety could be sufficiently
&longs;ecured by doors and bars, but this is a foe
from who&longs;e gra&longs;p no power of divinity can &longs;ave
me! His artifices will ever lay my fame and




happiness at his mercy. How &longs;hall I counterwork
his plots, or detect his coadjutor? He has taught
&longs;ome vile and abandoned female to mimic my
voice. Pleyel's ears were the witne&longs;&longs;es of my dishonor.
This is the midnight a&longs;&longs;ignation to which
he alluded. Thus is the &longs;ilence he maintained when
attempting to open the door of my chamber, accounted
for. He &longs;uppo&longs;ed me ab&longs;ent, and meant,
perhaps, had my apartment been acce&longs;&longs;ible, to leave
in it &longs;ome accu&longs;ing memorial.
Pleyel was no longer equally culpable. The
&longs;incerity of his angui&longs;h, the depth of his de&longs;pair, I
remembered with &longs;ome tendencies to gratitude. Yet
was he not precipitate? Was the conjecture that
my part was played by &longs;ome mimic &longs;o utterly untenable?
In&longs;tances of this faculty are common.
The wickedne&longs;s of Carwin mu&longs;t, in his opinion,
have been adequate to &longs;uch contrivances, and yet
the &longs;uppo&longs;ition of my guilt was adopted in preference
to that.
But how was this error to be unveiled? What but
my own a&longs;&longs;ertion had I to throw in the balance
again&longs;t it? Would this be permitted to outweigh
the te&longs;timony of his &longs;en&longs;es? I had no witnesses
to prove my exi&longs;tence in another place.
The real events of that night are marvellous. Few,
to whom they &longs;hould be related, would &longs;cruple to
di&longs;credit them. Pleyel is &longs;ceptical in a transcendant
degree. I cannot &longs;ummon Carwin to my bar,
and make him the atte&longs;tor of my innocence, and
the accu&longs;er of him&longs;elf.
My brother &longs;aw and comprehended my di&longs;tre&longs;s.
He was unacquainted, however, with the full extent
of it. He knew not by how many motives I
was incited to retrieve the good opinion of Pleyel.
He endeavored to con&longs;ole me. Some new event,




he &longs;aid, would occur to di&longs;entangle the maze. He
did not que&longs;tion the influence of my eloquence, if I
thought proper to exert it. Why not &longs;eek an interview
with Pleyel, and exact from him a minute
relation, in which &longs;omething may be met with serving
to de&longs;troy the probability of the whole?
I caught, with eagerne&longs;s, at this hope; but my
alacrity was damped by new reflections. Should
I, perfect in this re&longs;pect, and unblemi&longs;hed as I was,
thru&longs;t my&longs;elf, uncalled, into his pre&longs;ence, and make
my felicity depend upon his arbitrary verdict?
“If you chu&longs;e to &longs;eek an interview,” continued
Wieland, “you mu&longs;t make ha&longs;te, for Pleyel informed
me of his intention to &longs;et out this evening
or to-morrow on a long journey.”
No intelligence was le&longs;s expected or le&longs;s welcome
than this. I had thrown my&longs;elf in a window
&longs;eat; but now, &longs;tarting on my feet, I exclaimed,
“Good heavens! what is it you &longs;ay? a journey?
whither? when?”
“I cannot &longs;ay whither. It is a &longs;udden re&longs;olution
I believe. I did not hear of it till this morning. He
promi&longs;es to write to me as &longs;oon as he is &longs;ettled.”
I needed no further information as to the cau&longs;e
and i&longs;&longs;ue of this journey. The &longs;cheme of happiness
to which he had devoted his thoughts was
bla&longs;ted by the di&longs;covery of la&longs;t night. My preference
of another, and my unworthine&longs;s to be any
longer the object of his adoration, were evinced
by the &longs;ame act and in the &longs;ame moment. The
thought of utter de&longs;ertion, a de&longs;ertion originating
in &longs;uch a cau&longs;e, was the prelude to di&longs;traction.
That Pleyel &longs;hould abandon me forever, becau&longs;e
I was blind to his excellence, becau&longs;e I coveted
pollution, and wedded infamy, when, on the contrary,
my heart was the &longs;hrine of all purity, and




beat only for his &longs;ake, was a de&longs;tiny which, as long
as my life was in my own hands, I would by no
means con&longs;ent to endure.
I remembered that this evil was &longs;till preventable;
that this fatal journey it was &longs;till in my power to
procra&longs;tinate, or, perhaps, to occa&longs;ion it to be laid
a&longs;ide. There were no impediments to a vi&longs;it: I
only dreaded left the interview &longs;hould be too long
delayed. My brother befriended my impatience,
and readily con&longs;ented to furni&longs;h me with a chai&longs;e
and &longs;ervant to attend me. My purpo&longs;e was to go
immediately to Pleyel's farm, where his engagements
u&longs;ually detained him during the day.
