Dear Father and Mother,
I Am sorry to write you word, that the Hopes I
had of going to wait on Lady Davers are quite
over. My Lady would have had me; but my Master,
as I hear by the bye, would not consent to it. 
He said, Her Nephew might be taken with me, and
I might draw him in, or be drawn in by him; and
he thought, as his Mother lov'd me, and committed
me to his Care, he ought to continue me with him; 
and Mrs. Jervis would be a Mother to me. Mrs.
Jervis tells me, the Lady shook her Head, and said,
Ah! Brother! and that was all. And as you have
made me fearful by your Cautions, my Heart at
times misgives me. But I say nothing yet of your
Caution, or my own Uneasiness, to Mrs. Jervis; not
that I mistrust her, but for fear she should think
me presumptuous, and vain, and conceited, to have
any Fears about the matter, from the great Distance
between so great a Man, and so poor a Girl. But
yet Mrs. Jervis seem'd to build something upon
Lady Davers' shaking her Head, and saying, Ah!
Brother, and no more! God, I hope, will give me
his Grace; and so I will not, if I can help it, make
myself too uneasy; for I hope there is no Occasion. 
But every little matter that happens, I will
acquaint you with, that you shall continue to me
your good Advice, and pray for 
Your sad-hearted Pamela.
