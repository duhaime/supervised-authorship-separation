They proceed to levy contributions with great
success, until our hero sets out with the young
count for Vienna, where he enters into league
with another adventurer. 
Under this secure cover, Teresa levied
contributions upon her mistress with great
success. Some trinket was missing every day; 
the young lady's patience began to fall, the
faithful attendant was overwhelmed with consternation,
and with the appearance of extreme
chagrin, demanded her dismission, affirming
that these things were certainly effected by some
person in the family, with a view of murthering
her precious reputation. Miss Melvile,
not without difficulty, quieted her vexation
with assurances of inviolable confidence and
esteem, until a pair of diamond ear-rings vanished,
when Teresa could no longer keep her
affliction within bounds. Indeed this was an
event of more consequence, than all the rest
which had happened, for the jewels were valued
at five hundred florins. 
Mademoiselle was accordingly alarmed to
such a degree, that she made her mother acquainted
with her loss, and that good lady,
who was an excellent œconomist, did not fail
to give indications of extraordinary concern. 
She asked, if her daughter had reason to suspect
any individual in the family, and if she 

was perfectly confident of her own woman's
integrity: upon which Mademoiselle, with
many encomiums on the fidelity and attachment
of Teresa, recounted the adventure of
the chambermaid, who immediately underwent
a strict enquiry, and was even committed to
prison, on the strength of her former misdemeanour. 
Our adventurer's mate insisted upon
undergoing the same tryal with the rest of
the domesticks, and as usual comprehended
Fathom in her insinuations; while he seconded
the proposal, and privately counselled the
old lady to introduce Teresa to the magistrate
of the place. By these pre-concerted recriminations,
they escaped all suspicion of collusion. 
After a fruitless inquiry, the prisoner was discharged
from her confinement, and turned out
of the service of the count, in whose private
opinion the character of no person suffered so
much, as that of his own son, whom he suspected
of having embezzled the jewels, for the use
of a certain Inamorata, who, at that time, was
said to have captivated his affections. 
The old gentleman felt, upon this occasion,
all that internal anguish which a man of honour
may be supposed to suffer, on account of
a son's degeneracy; and without divulging his
sentiments, or even hinting his suspicions to
the youth himself, determined to detach him at
once from such dangerous connexions, by sending
him forthwith to Vienna, on pretence of
finishing his exercises at the academy, and ushering
him into acquaintance with the great
world. Though he would not be thought by
the young gentleman himself, to harbour the
least doubt of his morals, he did not scruple to 

unbosom himself on that subject to Ferdinand,
whose sagacity and virtue he held in great veneration. 
This indulgent patron expressed
himself in the most pathetic terms, on the untoward
disposition of his son; he told Fathom
that he should accompany Renaldo (that was
the youth's name) not only as a companion,
but a preceptor and pattern; conjured him to
assist his tutor in superintending his conduct,
and to reinforce the governor's precepts, by his
own example; to inculcate upon him, the most
delicate punctilio's of honour, and decoy him
into extravagance, rather than leave the least
illiberal sentiment in his heart. 
Our crafty adventurer, with demonstrations
of the utmost sensibility, acknowledged the
great goodness of the count in reposing such
confidence in his integrity; which, as he observed,
none but the worst of villains could abuse; 
and fervently wished that he might no
longer exist, than he should continue to remember
and resent the obligations he owed to his
kind benefactor. While preparations were
making for their departure, our hero held a
council with his associate, whom he enriched
with many sage instructions touching her future
operations; he at the same time disburthened
her of all or the greatest part of the spoils she
had won, and after having received divers
marks of bounty from the count and his lady,
together with a purse from his young mistress,
he set out for Vienna in the eighteenth year of
his age, with Renaldo and his governor, who
were provided with letters of recommendation
to some of the count's friends belonging to the
imperial court. 

Such a favourable introduction could not
fail of being advantageous to a youth of Ferdinand's
specious accomplishments: for he was
considered as the young count's companion,
admitted into his parties, and included in all
the entertainments to which Renaldo was invited. 
He soon distinguished himself by his activity
and address, in the course of those exercises
that were taught at the academy of which
he was pupil; his manners were so engaging
as to attract the acquaintance of his fellow students,
and his conversation being sprightly and
inoffensive, grew into very great request; in a
word, he and the young count formed a remarkable
contrast, which, in the eye of the world,
redounded to his advantage. 
They were certainly, in all respects, the reverse
of each other. Renaldo, under a total
defect of exterior cultivation, possessed a most
excellent understanding, with every virtue that
dignifies the human heart; while the other,
beneath a most agreeable outside, with an inaptitude
and aversion to letters, concealed an
amazing fund of villainy and ingratitude. Hitherto,
his observation had been confined to a
narrow sphere, and his reflexions, though surprizingly
just and acute, had not attained to that
maturity, which age and experience give: but
now, his perceptions began to be more distinct,
and extended to a thousand objects which had
never before come under his cognizance. 
He had formerly imagined, but was now fully
persuaded, that the sons of men preyed upon
one another, and such was the end and condition
of their being. Among the principal figures
of life, he observed few or no characters 

that did not bear a strong analogy to the savage
tyrants of the wood. One resembled a
tyger in fury and rapaciousness; a second prowled
about like an hungry wolf, seeking whom he
might devour; a third acted the part of a jackall,
in beating the bush for game to his voracious
employer; and a fourth imitated the wily
fox, in practising a thousand crafty ambuscades
for the destruction of the ignorant and unwary. 
This last was the department of life for which
he found himself best qualified by nature and
inclination, and he accordingly resolved that
his talent should not rust in his possession. He
was already pretty well versed in all the sciences
of play; but he had every day occasion to
see these arts carried to such a surprising pitch
of finesse and dexterity, as discouraged him
from building his schemes on that foundation. 
He therefore determined to fascinate the
judgment, rather than the eyes of his fellow-creatures,
by a continual exercise of that gift of
deceiving, with which he knew himself endued
to an unrivalled degree; and to acquire unbounded
influence with those who might be
subservient to his interest, by an assiduous application
to their prevailing passions. Not that
play was altogether left out in the projection of
his œconomy; though he engaged himself very
little in the executive part of gaming: He had
not been long in Vienna, when he entered into
league with a genius of that kind, whom he
distinguished among the pupils of the academy,
and who indeed had taken up his habitation
in that place, with a view to pillage the provincials
on their first arrival in town, before they
could be armed with proper circumspection to 

preserve their money, or have time to dispose
of it in any other shape. 
Similar characters naturally attract each
other, and people of our hero's principles are,
of all others, the most apt to distinguish their
own likeness wheresoever it occurs; because
they always keep the faculty of discerning in
full exertion. It was in consequence of this
mutual alertness, that Ferdinand and the stranger,
who was a native of Tyrol, perceived
themselves reflected in the dispositions of each
other, and immediately entered into an offensive
and defensive alliance: our adventurer undertaking
for the articles of intelligence, countenance
and counsel; and his associate charging
himself with the risque of execution.
