Pickle engages with a knight of Malta, in a conversation
upon the English stage, which is followed
by a dissertation on the theatres of the ancients,
by the doctor. 
The rest of the company proceeded to the
arsenal, which having viewed, together
with some remarkable churches, they, in their
return, went to the comedy, and saw the Cid of
Corneille tolerably well represented. In consequence
of this entertainment, the discourse at
supper turned upon dramatic performances; and
all the objections of Mons. de Scudery to the
piece they had seen acted, together with the decision
of the French academy, were canvassed
and discussed. The knight was a man of letters
and taste, and particularly well acquainted with
the state of the English stage; so that when the
painter boldly pronounced sentence against the
French manner of acting, on the strength of
having frequented a Covent-Garden club of criticks,
and been often admitted by virtue of an
order, into the pit; a comparison immediately
ensued, not between the authors, but the actors
of both nations, to whom the chevalier and Peregrine
were no strangers. Our hero, like a
good Englishman, made no scruple of giving the
preference to the performers of his own country,
who, he alledged, obeyed the genuine impulses
of nature, in exhibiting the passions of the human
mind; and entered so warmly into the spirit of
their several parts, that they often fancied themselves
the very heroes they represented. Whereas, 

the action of the Parisian players, even in their
most interesting characters, was generally such
an extravagance in voice and gesture, as is no
where to be observed but on the stage. To
illustrate this assertion, he availed himself of his
talent, and mimicked the manner and voice of all
the principal performers, male and female, belonging
to the French comedy; to the admiration
of the chevalier, who having complimented
him upon this surprising modulation, begged leave
to dissent in some particulars from the opinion he
had avowed. “That you have good actors in
England, (said he) it would be unjust and absurd
in me to deny; your theatre is adorned by one
woman, whose sensibility and sweetness of voice
is such as I have never observed on any other
stage; she has, besides, an elegance of person
and expression of features, that wonderfully adapt
her for the most engaging characters of your best
plays; and I must freely own that I have been
as highly delighted, and as deeply affected, by a
Monimia and Belvidera at London, as ever I
was by a Cornelia and Cleopatra at Paris. You
can, moreover, boast of several comic actors who
are perfect masters of buffoonery and grimace; 
though, to be free with you, I think, in these
qualifications you are excelled by the players of
Amsterdam: neither are you destitute of those,
who, with a good deal of cultivation, might acquire
some degree of excellence in the representation
of tragic characters: but I shall never cease
to wonder that the English, who are certainly a
sensible and discerning people should be so much
infatuated, as to applaud and caress with the most
extravagant approbation, not to say adoration and
regard, one or two gracioso's, who, I will be 

bold to say, would scarce be able to earn their
bread by their talents, on any other theatre under
the sun. I have seen one of these, in the celebrated
part of Richard the third, which, I believe,
is not a character of ridicule, sollicit and
triumph in the laugh of the audience, during the
best part of a scene in which the author has represented
that prince as an object of abhorrence. 
I have observed the same person in the character
of Hamlet, shake his fist with all the demonstrations
of wrath at his mistress, for no evident
cause, and behave like a ruffian to his own mother. 
Shocked at such want of dignity and decorum
in a prince, who seemed the favourite of the
people, I condemned the genius that produced
him, but, upon a second perusal of the play,
transferred my censure to the actor, who, in my
opinion, had egregiously mistaken the meaning
of the poet. At a juncture, when his whole soul
ought to be alarmed with terror and amazement,
and all his attention engrossed by the dreadful
object in view, I mean that of his friend whom
he had murthered; he expresses no passion but
that of indignation against a drinking glass,
which he violently dashes in pieces on the floor,
as if he had perceived a spider in his wine; nay,
while his eyes are fixed upon the ground, he starts
at the image of a dagger which he pretends to see
above his head, as if the pavement was a looking-glass
that represented it by reflexion: and at one
time, I saw him walk a-cross the stage, and lend
an inferior character a box on the ear, after he
had with great wrath pronounced “Take thou
that,” or some equivalent exclamation, at the
other end of the scene. He represents the grief
of an hero, by the tears and manner of a whining 

school-boy, and perverts the genteel deportment
of a gentleman, into the idle buffoonery of
a miserable tobacconist; his whole art is no other
than a succession of frantic vociferation, such as
I have heard in the cells of Bedlam, a slowness,
hesitation and oppression of speech, as if he was
troubled with an asthma, convulsive startings,
and a ductility of features, suited to the most extravagant
transitions. In a word, he is blessed
with a distinct voice, and a great share of vivacity; 
but in point of feeling, judgment, and
grace, is, in my opinion, altogether defective. 
Not to mention his impropriety in dress, which
is so absurd, that he acts the part of a youthful
prince, in the habit of an undertaker, and exhibits
the gay, fashionable Lothario, in the appearance
of a mountebank. I beg pardon for treating
this darling of the English with so little ceremony; 
and to convince you of my candour,
frankly confess, that notwithstanding all I have
said, he is qualified to make a considerable figure
in the low characters of humour, which are so
much relished by a London audience, if he could
be prevailed upon to abate of that monstrous burlesque,
which is an outrage against nature and
common sense. As for his competitor in fame,
with an equal share of capacity, he is inferior to
him in personal agility, sprightliness and voice. 
His utterance is a continual sing song, like the
chanting of vespers, and his action resembles that
of heaving ballast into the hold of a ship. In his
outward deportment, he seems to have confounded
the ideas of dignity and insolence of mien, acts
the crafty, cool, designing Crookback, as a loud,
shallow, blustering Hector; in the character of
the mild patriot Brutus, loses all temper and decorum; 

nay, so ridiculous is the behaviour of
him and Cassius at their interview, that setting
foot to foot, and grinning at each other, with
the aspect of two coblers enraged, they thrust
their left sides together, with repeated shocks,
that the hilts of their swords may clash for the
entertainment of the audience; as if they were a
couple of Merry Andrews, endeavouring to raise
the laugh of the vulgar, on some scaffold at Bartholomew
Fair. The despair of a great man
who falls a sacrifice to the infernal practices
of a subtle traitor, that enjoyed his confidence,
this English Æsopus represents, by beating
his own forehead, and bellowing like a bull; 
and indeed, in almost all his most interesting
scenes, performs such strange shakings of the
head, and other antic gesticulations, that when
I first saw him act, I imagined the poor man
laboured under that paralytical disorder, which
is known by the name of St. Vitus's dance. 
In short, he seems to be a stranger to the more
refined sensations of the soul, consequently his
expression is of the vulgar kind, and he must
often sink under the idea of the poet; so that he
has recourse to such violence of affected agitation,
as imposes upon the undiscerning spectator, but
to the eye of taste, evinces him a meer player
of that class whom your admired Shakespear justly
compares to nature's journeymen tearing a passion
to rags. Yet this man, in spite of all these absurdities,
is an admirable Falstaff, exhibits the character
of the eighth Henry to the life, is reasonably
applauded in the Plain Dealer, excels in the
part of Sir John Brute, and would be equal to
many humorous situations in low comedy, which 

his pride will not allow him to undertake. I
should not have been so severe upon these rivals,
had not I seen them extolled by their partizans,
with the most ridiculous and fulsome manifestation
of praise, even in those very circumstances
wherein (as I have observed) they chiefly failed.” 
Pickle, not a little piqued to hear the qualifications
of the two most celebrated actors in
England treated with such freedom and disrespect,
answered with some asperity, that the chevalier
was a true critick, more industrious in observing
the blemishes than in acknowledging the
excellence of those who fell under his examination. 
It was not to be supposed that one actor could
shine equally in all characters; and though his
observations were undoubtedly very judicious, he
himself could not help wondering that some of
them had always escaped his notice, though he
had been an assiduous frequenter of the playhouse. 
“The two players in question, said he, have,
in your own opinion, a considerable share of merit
in the characters of comic life; and as to the
manners of the great personages in tragedy, and
the operation of the grand passions of the soul, I
apprehend, they may be variously represented,
according to the various complexion and cultivation
of different men. A Spaniard, for example,
though impelled by the same passion, will
express it very differently from a Frenchman; 
and what is looked upon as graceful vivacity and
address by the one, would be considered as impertinence
and foppery by the other: nay, so opposite
is your common deportment from that of
some other nations, that one of your own countrymen,
in the relation of his travels observes, 

that the Persians even of this age, when they see
any man perform unnecessary gestures, say he
is either a fool or a Frenchman. The standard
of demeanour being thus unsettled, a Turk, a
Moor, an Indian, or inhabitant of any country,
whose customs and dress are widely different from
ours, may in his sentiments, possess all the dignity
of the human heart, and be inspired by the noblest
passion that animates the soul, and yet excite
the laughter rather than the respect of an
European spectator. 
When I first beheld your famous Parisian stage-heroine,
in one of her principal parts, her attitudes
seemed so violent, and she tossed her arms
around with such extravagance, that she put me
in mind of a windmill under the agitation of a
hard gale; while her voice and features exhibited
the lively representation of an English scold. The
action of your favourite male-performer was, in
my opinion, equally unnatural; he appeared with
the affected airs of a dancing-master; at the most
pathetic junctures of his fate, he lifted up his
hands above his head, like a tumbler going to
vault, and spoke as if his throat had been obstructed
by an hair-brush; yet, when I compared
their manners with those of the people before
whom they performed, and made allowance for
that exaggeration which obtains on all theatres, I
was insensibly reconciled to their method of performance,
and could distinguish abundance of merit
beneath that oddity of appearance.” 
The chevalier perceiving Peregrine a little irritated
at what he had said, asked pardon for the
liberty he had taken, in censuring the English
players, assuring him that he had an infinite veneration
for the British learning, genius and taste, 

which were so justly distinguished in the world of
letters; and that notwithstanding the severity of
his criticism, he thought the theatre of London
much better supplied with actors than that of
Paris. The young gentleman thanked him for
his polite condescension, at which Pallet exulted,
saying with a shake of the head, “I believe so
too, Monsieur;” and the physician, impatient of
the dispute in which he had bore no share, observed
with a supercilious air, that the modern
stage was altogether beneath the notice of one
who had an idea of ancient magnificence and
execution; that plays ought to be exhibited at
the expence of the state, as those of Sophocles
were by the Athenians; and that proper judges
should be appointed for receiving or rejecting all
such performances as are offered to the public. 
He then described the theatre at Rome, which
contained eighty thousand spectators, gave them
a learned disquisition into the nature of the Persona,
or mask, worn by the Roman actors, which,
he said, was a machine that covered the whole
head, furnished on the inside with a brazen concavity,
that, by reverberating the sound as it issued
from the mouth, raised the voice, so as to
render it audible to such an extended audience. 
He explained the difference between the Saltator
and Declamator, one of whom acted, while the
other rehearsed the part; and from thence took
occasion to mention the perfection of their pantomimes,
who were so amazingly distinct in the
exercise of their art, that a certain prince of
Pontus being at the court of Nero, and seeing
one of them represent a story, begged him of the
emperor, in order to employ him as an interpreter
among barbarous nations, whose language he did 

not understand. Nay, divers cynic philosophers,
who had condemned this entertainment unseen,
when they chanced to be eye-witnesses of their
admirable dexterity, expressed their sorrow for
having so long debarred themselves of such rational
enjoyment. 
He dissented, however, from the opinion of
Peregrine, who, as a proof of their excellence,
had advanced, that some of the English actors
fancied themselves the very thing they represented,
and recounted a story from Lucian, of a certain
celebrated pantomime, who in acting the part of
Ajax in his frenzy, was transported into a real fit
of delirium, during which he tore to-pieces the
cloaths of that actor who stalked before him,
beating the stage with iron shoes, in order to increase
the noise, snatched an instrument from
one of the musicians, and broke it over the head
of him who represented Ulysses; and running
to the consular bench, mistook a couple of senators
for the sheep which were to be slain. The
audience applauded him to the skies; but so conscious
was the mimic of his own extravagance,
when he recovered the use of his reason, that he
actually fell sick with mortification; and being
afterwards desired to re-act the piece, flatly refused
to appear in any such character, saying,
that the shortest follies were the best, and that it
was sufficient for him to have been a madman
once in his life.
