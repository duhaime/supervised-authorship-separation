Friday, July 21. 
Miss Arabella Harlowe,
If you had half as much sense as you have ill-nature,
you would (notwithstanding the exuberance
of the latter) have been able to distinguish between
a kind intention to you all (that you might 

have the less to reproach yourselves with, if a deplorable
case should happen) and an officiousness I owed
you not, by reason of freedoms at least reciprocal. I
will not, for the unhappy body's sake, as you call a
Sister you have helped to make so, say all that I could
say. If what I fear happen, you shall hear (whether
desired or not) all the mind of 
Anna Howe.
