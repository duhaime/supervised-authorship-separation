—THE town of Abdera,
notwithstanding Democritus lived
there trying all the powers of irony
and laughter to reclaim it, was the
vilest and most profligate town in all
Thrace. What for poisons, conspiracies
and assassinations—libels, pasquinades
and tumults, there was no
going there by day—'twas worse by
night. 
Now, when things were at the
worst, it came to pass, that the Andromeda
of Euripides being represented
at Abdera, the whole orchestra
was delighted with it: but of all the 

passages which delighted them, nothing
operated more upon their imaginations,
than the tender strokes of
nature which the poet had wrought
up in that pathetic speech of Perseus, 
O Cupid, prince of God and men, &c. 
Every man almost spoke pure iambics
the next day, and talk'd of nothing
but Perseus his pathetic address 
—“O Cupid! prince of God
and men”—in every street of Abdera,
in every house —“O Cupid!
Cupid!”—in every mouth, like the
natural notes of some sweet melody
which drops from it whether it will
or no—nothing but “Cupid! Cupid!
prince of God and men” —The
fire caught—and the whole city, like 

the heart of one man, open'd itself
to Love. 
No pharmacopolist could sell one
grain of helebore—not a single armourer
had a heart to forge one instrument
of death —Friendship and
Virtue met together, and kiss'd each
other in the street—the golden age
return'd, and hung o'er the town of
Abdera—every Abderite took his
oaten pipe, and every Abderitish
woman left her purple web, and
chastly sat her down and listen'd to
the song— 
'Twas only in the power, says the
Fragment, of the God whose empire 

extendeth from heaven to earth, and
even to the depths of the sea, to have
done this.
