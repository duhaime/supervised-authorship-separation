If to Divert and Entertain,
and at the same time to
Instruct, and Improve the
Minds of the Youth of
both Sexes: 
If to inculate Religion and Morality
in so easy and agreeable a manner, as
shall render them equally delightful and
profitable to the younger Class of Readers,
as well as worthy of the Attention of
Persons of maturer Years and Understandings: 

If to set forth in the most exemplary
Lights, the Parental, the Filial, and the
Social Duties, and that from low to high
Life: 
If to paint Vice in its proper Colours,
to make it deservedly Odious; and
to set Virtue in its own amiable Light,
to make it truly Lovely: 
If to draw Characters justly, and to
support them equally: 
If to raise a Distress from natural
Causes, and to excite Compassion from
proper Motives: 
If to teach the Man of Fortune how
to use it; the Man of Passion how to
subdue it; and the Man of Intrigue,
how, gracefully, and with Honour to himself,
to reclaim: 

If to give practical Examples, worthy
to be followed in the most critical and
affecting Cases, by the modest Virgin, the
chaste Bride, and the obliging Wife: 
If to effect all these good Ends, in
so probable, so natural, so lively a manner,
as shall engage the Passions of every
sensible Reader, and strongly interest them
in the edifying Story: 
And all without raising a single
Idea throughout the Whole, that shall shock
the exactest Purity, even in those tender
Instances where the exactest Purity would
be most apprehensive: 
If these, (embellished with a great
Variety of entertaining Incidents) be
laudable or worthy Recommendations of
any Work, the Editor of the following
Letters, which have their Foundation in
Truth and Nature, ventures to assert, 

that all these desirable Ends are obtained
in these Sheets: And as he is therefore
confident of the favourable Reception
which he boldly bespeaks for this little
Work; he thinks any further Preface or
Apology for it, unnecessary: And the
rather for two Reasons, 1st. Because he
can Appeal from his own Passions,
(which have been uncommonly moved in
perusing these engaging Scenes) to the
Passions of Every one who shall read them
with the least Attention: And, in the next
place, because an Editor may reasonably
be supposed to judge with an Impartiality
which is rarely to be met with in an
Author towards his own Works. 
The Editor.
