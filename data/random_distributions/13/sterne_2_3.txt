—Then, positively, there is nothing
in the question, that I can see, either good
or bad. —Then let me tell you, Sir,
it was a very unseasonable question at
least,—because it scattered and dispersed
the animal spirits, whose business it was
to have escorted and gone hand-in-hand
with the HOMUNCULUS, and conducted
him safe to the place destined for
his reception. 
The Homunculus, Sir, in how-ever
low and ludicrous a light he may appear,
in this age of levity, to the eye of folly
or prejudice:—to the eye of reason in
scientifick research, he stands confess'd— 
a Being guarded and circumscribed with
rights: —The minutest philosophers, 

who, by the bye, have the most enlarged
understandings, (their souls being inversely
as their enquiries) shew us incontestably,
That the Homunculus is
created by the same hand,—engender'd
in the same course of nature,—endowed
with the same loco-motive powers and
faculties with us: —That he consists,
as we do, of skin, hair, fat, flesh, veins,
arteries, ligaments, nerves, cartileges,
bones, marrow, brains, glands, genitals,
humours, and articulations;—is a Being
of as much activity,—and, in all
senses of the word, as much and as truly
our fellow-creature as my Lord Chancellor
of England. —He may be benefited,
he may be injured,—he may obtain redress; 
—in a word, he has all the claims
and rights of humanity, which Tully,
Puffendorff, or the best ethick writers 

allow to arise out of that state and relation. 
Now, dear Sir, what if any accident
had befallen him in his way alone?— 
or that, thro' terror of it, natural to so
young a traveller, my little gentleman
had got to his journey's end miserably
spent;—his muscular strength and
virility worn down to a thread;—his
own animal spirits ruffled beyond description,
—and that in this sad disorder'd
state of nerves, he had laid down a prey
to sudden starts, or a series of melancholy
dreams and fancies for nine long,
long months together. —I tremble to
think what a foundation had been laid
for a thousand weaknesses both of body
and mind, which no skill of the physician
or the philosopher could ever afterwards
have set thoroughly to rights.
