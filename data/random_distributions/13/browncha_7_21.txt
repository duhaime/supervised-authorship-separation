To Mrs. Fielder.
Philadelphia, October 28.

I need not hesitate a moment to answer
this letter. I will be all that my revered mamma,
wishes me to be. I have vowed an eternal
separation from Colden, and to enable me to
keep this vow, I entreat you to permit me to
come to you.
I will leave this house in any body's care you
direct. My Molly and the boy Tom I shall find
it no easy task to part with, but, I will, nevertheless,
send the former to her mother, who is
thrifty and well to live. I beg you to permit me
to bring the boy with me. I wait your answer.

Jane Talbot.
