When Maria had come a little
to herself, I ask'd her if she
remember'd a pale thin person of
a man who had sat down betwixt her
and her goat about two years before? 
She said, she was unsettled much at
that time, but remember'd it upon
two accounts—that ill as she was she
saw the person pitied her; and next,
that her goat had stolen his handkerchief,
and she had beat him for the
theft—she had wash'd it, she said, in
the brook, and kept it ever since in
her pocket to restore it to him in case
she should ever see him again, which, 

she added, he had half promised her. 
As she told me this she took the handkerchief
out of her pocket to let me
see it; she had folded it up neatly in
a couple of vine leaves, tied round
with a tendril—on opening it, I saw
an S mark'd in one of the corners. 
She had since that, she told
me, stray'd as far as Rome, and
walk'd round St. Peter's once—and
return'd back—that she found her
way alone across the Apennines—had
travell'd over all Lombardy without
money—and through the flinty roads
of Savoy without shoes—how she had
borne it, and how she had got supported,
she could not tell—but God 

tempers the wind, said Maria, to the
shorn lamb. 
Shorn indeed! and to the quick,
said I; and wast thou in my own
land, where I have a cottage, I would
take thee to it and shelter thee: thou
shouldst eat of my own bread, and
drink of my own cup—I would be
kind to thy Sylvio—in all thy weaknesses
and wanderings I would seek
after thee and bring thee back—when
the sun went down I would say my
prayers, and when I had done thou
shouldst play thy evening song upon
thy pipe, nor would the incense of
my sacrifice be worse accepted for
entering heaven along with that of a
broken heart. 

Nature melted within me, as I
utter'd this; and Maria observing, as I
took out my handkerchief, that it
was steep'd too much already to be of
use, would needs go wash it in the
stream. —And where will you dry it,
Maria? said I—I'll dry it in my bosom,
said she—'twill do me good. 
And is your heart still so warm,
Maria? said I. 
I touch'd upon the string on which
hung all her sorrows—she look'd with
wistful disorder for some time in my
face; and then, without saying any
thing, took her pipe, and play'd her
service to the Virgin—The string I
had touch'd ceased to vibrate—in a 

moment or two Maria returned to
herself—let her pipe fall—and rose
up. 
And where are you going, Maria?
said I. —She said to Moulines. — 
Let us go, said I, together. —Maria
put her arm within mine, and lengthening
the string, to let the dog follow,
in that order we entered Moulines.
