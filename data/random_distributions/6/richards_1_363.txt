Miss Howe, To Miss Arabella Harlowe. 

Thursday, July 20. 
Miss Harlowe,
I cannot help acquainting you (however it may be
received, coming from me) that your poor Sister
is dangerously ill, at the house of one Smith, who
keeps a glover's and perfume-shop, in King-street,
Covent-Garden. She knows not that I write. Some
violent words, in the nature of an imprecation, from 

her Father, afflict her greatly in her weak state. I
presume not to direct you what to do in this case. 
You are her Sister. I therefore could not help
writing to you, not only for her sake, but for your
own. I am, Madam, 
Your humble Servant,
Anna Howe.
