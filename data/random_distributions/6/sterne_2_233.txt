In mentioning the word gay (as in
the close of the last chapter) it puts
one (i. e. an author) in mind of the word
spleen—especially if he has any thing
to say upon it: not that by any analysis
—or that from any table of interest or
genealogy, there appears much more
ground of alliance betwixt them, than
betwixt light and darkness, or any two
of the most unfriendly opposites in nature
—only 'tis an undercraft of authors
to keep up a good understanding
amongst words, as politicians do amongst
men—not knowing how near they may

be under a necessity of placing them to
each other—which point being now
gain'd, and that I may place mine exactly
to my mind, I write it down here— 
SPLEEN.
This, upon leaving Chantilly, I declared
to be the best principle in the
world to travel speedily upon; but I
gave it only as matter of opinion, I
still continue in the same sentiments— 
only I had not then experience enough
of its working to add this, that though
you do get on at a tearing rate, yet you
get on but uneasily to yourself at the
same time; for which reason I here quit
it entirely, and for ever, and 'tis heartily
at one's service—it has spoiled me the digestion
of a good supper, and brought 

on a bilious diarrhæa, which has brought
me back again to my first principle on
which I set out—and with which I
shall now scamper it away to the banks
of the Garonne— 
—No;—I cannot stop a moment
to give you the character of the people
—their genius—their manners—their customs
—their laws—their religion—their
government—their manufactures—their
commerce—their finances, with all the resources
and hidden springs which sustain
them: qualified as I may be, by spending
three days and two nights amongst
them, and during all that time, making
these things the entire subject of my enquiries
and reflections— 

Still—still I must away—the roads
are paved—the posts are short—the days
are long—'tis no more than noon—I shall
be at Fontainbleau before the king— 
—Was he going there? not that I
know—
