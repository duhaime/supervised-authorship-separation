Will probably occasion various conjectures on what is to come. 
A very small share of experience and observation may serve to inform us, that there is no passion of the soul which more easily wears off than that of grief for the death of friends; and indeed it is highly reasonable that it should be so,—religion obliges us to a perfect resignation to the decrees of providence;—philosophy teaches us that it is weak and unbecoming the dignity of our species to bewail woes, which in their very nature are irredeemable;—and the laws of society forbid us to indulge any emotions that might enervate our abilities, and render us less useful to the community. 
Whether any arguments, drawn from the above considerations, could claim a part in enabling Jemmy to recover his former vivacity, I will not take upon me to determine; but, certain it is, that in a very short time nothing of the mourner, except the habit, was to be seen about him. 
It would have been somewhat strange, indeed, if a gentleman, not yet quite one and twenty, possess'd of a very plentiful estate, and master of accomplishments to recommend him to the best company, should have had any leisure for melancholy reflections in a town like London, so abounding with every thing that can entertain and raise pleasing sensations in a youthful heart. 
In the midst of all the various amusements he gave into, his dear Jenny, however, was not forgot,—scarce a day past over without his visiting her once, if not more, in some one part of it;—they behaved to each other in the same fashion they had always been accustom'd to do,—quite open and free, without the least breach of innocence or modesty;—kind without any mixture of dissimulation, and obliging without taking any pains to be so. 
Scarce are there any where to be found two persons whose dispositions so exactly tally'd;—both of them were gay and volatile almost to an excess,—both lov'd the pleasures of the town, yet never pursued them so far as to transgress the bounds of strict virtue in the one, nor honour in the other;—both had an affluence of wit, and a great talent for ridicule; and both had too much good nature and generosity to extend that propensity to the prejudice of any one:—in fine, they were what the poet says, 
In all so much alike, each heart
Seem'd but the others counter part.
To the foregoing character of them might also have been added, that neither of them were possess'd of any strong passions; and though the affection they had for each other was truly tender and sincere; yet neither of them felt those impatiencies,—those anxieties,—those transporting hopes,—those distracting fears,—those causeless jealousies, or any of those thousand restless, sensations that usually perplex a mind devoted to an amorous flame;—they were happy when they met, but not uneasy when they parted;—he was not in the least alarm'd on finding she was frequently visited by some of the finest gentlemen in town; nor was she at all disconcerted when she was told he was well received by ladies of the most distinguish'd characters. 
I am well aware, that many of my readers will be apt to say,—people who could think and act in the manner I have describ'd, either had no charms for each other, or seem'd incapable of loving at all;—and I am ready to confess, that according to the receiv'd notions of love, there was a seeming inconsistency in this conduct, and had more the appearance of a cold indifference than the warm glow of mutual inclinations. 
Yet that they did love each other is most certain, as will hereafter be demonstrated by proofs much more unquestionable than all those extravagancies;—those raging flights commonly; look'd upon as infallible tokens of the passion, but which, how fierce soever the fires they spring from may burn for a while, we see frequently extinguish of themselves, and leave nothing but the smoke behind. 
All the formalities of a first and second mourning for the dead being over, every one now expected they should soon see the completion of a marriage they knew had been so long intended;—Jemmy also had some thoughts of it himself, and began to consider on such things as were proper to be done previous to the solemnity. 
On looking over his father's papers he had found marriage articles between him and Jenny, with a deed of settlement on her by way of dower, which the old gentleman had caused to be drawn up some time before his death;—these writings he now put into his pocket and carried them to her, in order for her approbation. 
‘What are these? cry'd she, when he presented her with the packet: —They are what concern you as nearly as myself,—replied he,—therefore, I would have you examine the contents at some leisure hour, and let me know if you think there is any thing in them that requires alteration or amendment. 
‘They ought to be things of great consequence, indeed, by their bulk,’—said she smiling, and beginning to unfold the parchment,—‘You know,’—resumed he with the same gay air,—‘for what we are design'd by both our fathers;—and I suppose mine, as being your guardian also, thought himself the most proper person to decide the terms on which we should come together. 
‘I have no reason,—answered she,—to suspect either his justice or good will towards me;—however, I will take the first opportunity of seeing what he has done for me on this score;’—in speaking this she lock'd the writings he had brought in an escrutore that was plac'd just behind her;—then turning hastily to him,—‘but, my dear Jemmy,—continued she,—you must excuse me for this evening;—you must know I have promised some company to go to Ranelagh, and I believe they are already beginning to expect me. —It happens very luckily,—said he,—for there are three or four young fellows of us, who have promised to give some ladies the music on the river to night,—and I could not have stay'd above three minutes longer with you; for they depend upon me to see the hands all ready,—so, my dear Jenny, I will not detain you;—farewel. —Farewel Jemmy,’ rejoined she,—and with these words both ran down stairs together;—he went into one chair and she into another, to fulfil their several engagements. 
The next day they saw each other again, as usual,—after some little chit chat on ordinary affairs, he asked her if she had found time to look over the writings he had brought the day before;—‘Yes,’—answer'd she, ‘I breakfasted on them this morning;—‘Well,’—cried he,—what objections have you to make? —‘None at all,’—reply'd she,—‘I rather think your father has made a better provision for me than my own would have desired or expected 
‘Then I suppose there is nothing left for us to do,—said he,—but sign and seal, and go together before a parson. —Some people may say so,’—reply'd she;—but for my part I am of a quite different opinion, and think there is a great deal for us both to do before we come to the words,—to have and to hold. 
‘I easily comprehend what you would be at,—resumed he laughing;—new cloaths for ourselves and servants,—some addition to the equipage,—a more fashionable chariot,—another pair of horses perhaps. Hold,—hold,’—cried she interrupting him,—‘I have no such stuff in my thoughts, I do assure you;—what I mean is infinitely more material than all you have mention'd;—and that is,—the being certain within ourselves of never repenting the engagements we are about to enter into. 
‘Repenting,—said he,—there is no danger of that I believe;—I will promise you to make as good a husband as I can,—and I am sure you will make a good wife.’ —‘That is all as chance directs,—answer'd she,—we may think perfectly well at one time, and act very ill at another; in fine, my dear Jemmy,—continued she,—I think we ought to know a little more of the world and of ourselves before we enter into serious matrimony. 
‘Why faith, Jenny,—answer'd he,—I cannot help saying but that you are in the right;—I should not much like, methinks, to be quite so soon the father of a family. —And I should hate to be called mamma,—rejoin'd she,—before I arrive at an age to write myself woman. 
‘I wonder,—pursued she,—how people can resolve to cut themselves off from all the pleasures of life, just as they are beginning to have a relish for them;—how should I regret being confin'd at home by my domestic affairs, while others of my sex and age were flaunting in the mall, or making one at the rout of a woman of quality?—and how would it mortify you to hear the ladies cry disdainfully, Jemmy Jessamy is a very pretty fellow;—but he is married,—and then toss up their heads, and in contempt of you turn the doux yeux on the next man in company, though perhaps he happens to be one of the most insignificant fops that the follies of the times ever fashioned, and without any one merit to recommend him but merely his having no wife?’ 
Jenny, who had always somewhat amiably striking in her eyes and tone of of voice, appeared at this instant so particularly brilliant, that Jemmy could not forbear catching her in his arms with the utmost rapture,—crying at the same time,—‘I shall little regard the contempt of all the women in the world, while blest with the kindness of my dear,—dear Jenny. 
‘And I think too,’—reply'd she, returning his embrace, and looking on him with a most enchanting softness,—‘that I could forgo all other joys of life for those of my dear Jemmy's love; yet after all,—continued she,—we may both of us be deceived in our own hearts;—I have heard the wife say, that nothing is so difficult to acquire as the true knowledge of ourselves,—and who can tell what time and accidents may produce!’ 
Here Jemmy was beginning to make the most fervent protestations, that it was not in the power of fate itself to occasion the least alteration in his present sentiments on her account;—and Jenny was half persuaded, by what she felt in her own breast, that an affection, grounded and habitual as theirs had been, was incapable of varying on either side;—so that if this tender conversation had continued but a very little longer, it is highly probable they had agreed to put the finishing stroke to the work, their parents had labour'd for, by an immediate marriage. 
Of this, however, there can be no positive assurance, as it was broke off by some company coming in;—but whether fortunately or unfortunately for the lovers, this interruption happen'd in so critical a moment, the reader, if he has patience to wait, will in the sequel of this history be inform'd.
