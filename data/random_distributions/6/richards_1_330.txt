Miss Clarissa Harlowe, To Miss Howe. 

Tuesday, July 11. 
&dotup;Forgive you, my dear! —Most cordially
do I forgive you —Will you forgive me for
some sharp things I wrote in return to yours of the
5th? You could not have loved me, as you do,
nor had the concern you have always shewn for my
Honour, if you had not been utterly displeased with
me, on the appearance which my conduct wore to
you when you wrote that Letter. I most heartily
thank you, my best and only Love, for the opportunity
you gave me of clearing it up; and for being
generously ready to acquit me of intentional blame,
the moment you had read my melancholy Narrative.&dotup; 
As you are so earnest to have all the particulars of
my sad Story before you, I will, if life and spirits be
lent me, give you an ample account of all that has befallen
me, from the time you mention. But this, it
is very probable, you will not see, till after the close
of my last scene: And I shall write with a view to
that, I hope no other voucher will be wanted for the
veracity of the Writer, be who will the Reader. 
I am far from thinking myself out of the reach of
this man's further violence. But what can I do? 
Whither can I fly? —Perhaps my bad State of Health
(which must grow worse, as recollection of the past
evils, and reflections upon them, grow heavier and
heavier upon me) may be my protection. Once,
indeed, I thought of going abroad; and had I the
prospect of many years before me, I would go. — 
But, my dear, the Blow is given. —Nor have you
reason, now, circumstanced as I am, to be concerned
that it is. What a heart must I have, if it be not
broken! —And indeed, my dear friend, I do so earnestly 

wish for the last closing scene, and with so
much comfort find myself in a declining way, that I
even sometimes ungratefully regret that naturally
healthy constitution, which used to double upon me
all my enjoyments. 
As to the earnestly recommended prosecution, I
may possibly touch upon it more largely hereafter, if
ever I shall have better spirits; for they are at present
extremely sunk and low. But, just now, I will only
say, that I would sooner suffer every evil (the repetition
of the capital one excepted) than appear publicly
in a Court to do myself justice (a) . And I am
heartily grieved, that your Mother prescribes such a
measure as the condition of our future correspondence: 
For the continuance of your friendship, my
dear, and the desire I had to correspond with you to
my life's end, were all my remaining hopes and consolation. 
Nevertheless, as that friendship is in the
power of the heart, not of the hand only, I hope I
shall not forfeit that. 
O my dear! what would I give to obtain a revocation
of my Father's malediction! A Reconciliation
is not to be hoped for. You, who never loved my
Father, may think my solicitude on this head a weakness: 
But the motive for it, sunk as my spirits at times
are, is not always weak. 
* *
I approve of the method you prescribe for the
conveyance of our Letters; and have already caused
the Porter of the Inn to be engaged to bring to me
yours, the moment that Collins arrives with them. 
And the servant of the house where I am, will be
permitted to carry mine to Collins for you. 
I have written a Letter to Miss Rawlins of Hamstead; 
the Answer to which, just now received, has 

helped me to the knowlege of the vile contrivance,
by which this wicked man got your Letter of June
the 10th. I will give you the contents of both. 
In mine to her, I briefly acquaint her ‘with what
had befallen me, thro' the vileness of the women
who had been passed upon me, as the Aunt and
Cousin of the wickedest of men; and own, that I
never was married to him. I desire her to make
particular enquiry, and to let me know, who it
was at Mrs. Moore's, that on Sunday afternoon,
June 11. while I was at Church, received a Letter
from Miss Howe, pretending to be me, and lying
on a Couch: —Which Letter, had it come to my
hands, would have saved me from ruin. I excuse
myself (on the score of the delirium, which the
horrid usage I had received threw me into, and
from a confinement as barbarous and illegal) that I
had not before applied to Mrs. Moore, for an account
of what I was indebted to her: Which account
I now desired. And, for fear of being traced
by Mr. Lovelace, I directed her to superscribe her
Answer, To Mrs. Mary Atkins; to be left till
called for, at the Belle-Savage Inn, on Ludgate-Hill.’ 
In her Answer, she tells me, ‘that the vile wretch
prevailed upon Mrs. Bevis to personate me [A
sudden motion of his, it seems, on the appearance
of your messenger] and persuaded her to lie along
on a couch: A handkerchief over her neck and
face; pretending to be ill; the credulous woman
drawn in by false notions of your ill offices to keep
up a variance between a man and his wife—and so
taking the Letter from your messenger as me. 
‘Miss Rawlins takes pains to excuse Mrs. Bevis's
intention. She expresses their astonishment and
concern at what I communicate: But is glad, however,
and so they are all, that they know in time
the vileness of the base man; the two widows and 

herself having, at his earnest invitation, designed
me a visit at Mrs. Sinclair's; supposing all to be
happy between him and me; as he assured them
was the case. Mr. Lovelace, she informs me, had
handsomely satisfied Mrs. Moore. And Miss Rawlins
concludes with wishing to be favoured with the
particulars of so extraordinary a Story, as these particulars
may be of use, to let her see what wicked
creatures (women as well as men) there are in the
world.’ 
I thank you, my dear, for the draughts of your
two Letters which were intercepted by this horrid
man. I see the great advantage they were of to him,
in the prosecution of his villainous designs against the
poor wretch whom he has so long made the sport of his
abhorred inventions. 
Let me repeat, that I am quite sick of life; and of
an earth, in which innocent and benevolent spirits are
sure to be considered as aliens, and to be made sufferers,
by the genuine sons and daughters of that earth. 
How unhappy, that those Letters only which could
have acquainted me with his horrid views, and armed
me against them, and against the vileness of the base
women, should fall into his hands! —Unhappier still,
in that my very escape to Hamstead gave him the opportunity of receiving them! 
Nevertheless, I cannot but still wonder, how it was
possible for that Tomlinson to know what passed between
Mr. Hickman and my Uncle Harlowe (a) : A
circumstance, which gave that vile impostor most of
his credit with me. 
How the wicked wretch himself could find me out
at Hamstead, must also remain wholly a mystery to
me. He may glory in his contrivances —He, who has
more wickedness than wit, may glory in his contrivances! 
—But, after all, I shall, I humbly presume to
hope, be happy, when he, poor wretch, will be— 
Alas!—who can say what!— 

Adieu, my dearest friend! —May you be happy! — 
And then your Clarissa cannot be wholly miserable!
