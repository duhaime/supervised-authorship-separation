I never felt what the distress of
plenty was in any one shape till
now—to travel it through the Bourbonnois,
the sweetest part of France— 
in the hey-day of the vintage, when
Nature is pouring her abundance into
every one's lap, and every eye is
lifted up—a journey through each
step of which music beats time to
Labour, and all her children are rejoicing
as they carry in their clusters
—to pass through this with my affections
flying out, and kindling at every 

group before me—and every one of
'em was pregnant with adventures. 
Just heaven!—it would fill up
twenty volumes—and alas! I have but
a few small pages left of this to croud
it into—and half of these must be
taken up with the poor Maria my
friend, Mr. Shandy, met with near
Moulines. 
The story he had told of that disorder'd
maid affect'd me not a little
in the reading; but when I got within
the neighbourhood where she lived,
it returned so strong into my mind,
that I could not resist an impulse
which prompted me to go half a
league out of the road to the village 

where her parents dwelt to enquire
after her. 
'Tis going, I own, like the Knight
of the Woeful Countenance, in quest
of melancholy adventures—but I
know not how it is, but I am never so
perfectly conscious of the existence
of a soul within me, as when I am entangled
in them. 
The old mother came to the door,
her looks told me the story before she
open'd her mouth—She had lost her
husband; he had died, she said, of
anguish, for the loss of Maria's senses
about a month before. —She had
feared at first, she added, that it
would have plunder'd her poor girl 

of what little understanding was
left—but, on the contrary, it had
brought her more to herself—still she
could not rest—her poor daughter,
she said, crying, was wandering somewhere
about the road— 
—Why does my pulse beat languid
as I write this? and what made La
Fleur, whose heart seem'd only to be
tuned to joy, to pass the back of his
hand twice across his eyes, as the
woman stood and told it? I beckon'd
to the postilion to turn back
into the road. 
When we had got within half a
league of Moulines, at a little opening
in the road leading to a thicket, I 

discovered poor Maria sitting under
a poplar—she was sitting with her
elbow in her lap, and her head leaning
on one side within her hand—a
small brook ran at the foot of the
tree. 
I bid the postilion go on with the
chaise to Moulines—and La Fleur
to bespeak my supper—and that I
would walk after him. 
She was dress'd in white, and much
as my friend described her, except
that her hair hung loose, which before
was twisted within a silk net. —She
had, superadded likewise to her jacket,
a pale green ribband which fell across
her shoulder to the waist; at the end 

of which hung her pipe. —Her goat
had been as faithless as her lover; 
and she had got a little dog in lieu
of him, which she had kept tied by a
string to her girdle; as I look'd at
her dog, she drew him towards her
with the string. —“Thou shalt not
leave me, Sylvio,” said she. I look'd
in Maria's eyes, and saw she was
thinking more of her father than of
her lover or her little goat; for as she
utter'd them the tears trickled down
her cheeks. 
I sat down close by her; and Maria
let me wipe them away as they
fell with my handkerchief. —I then
steep'd it in my own—and then in
hers—and then in mine—and then 

I wip'd hers again—and as I did
it, I felt such undescribable emotions
within me, as I am sure could not
be accounted for from any combinations
of matter and motion. 
I am positive I have a soul; nor
can all the books with which materialists
have pester'd the world ever
convince me of the contrary.
