What a rate have I gone on at,
curvetting and frisking it away,
two up and two down for four volumes
together, without looking once behind,
or even on one side of me, to see whom
I trod upon! —I'll tread upon no one,— 
quoth I to myself when I mounted—I'll
take a good rattling gallop; but I'll not
hurt the poorest jack-ass upon the road— 
So off I set—up one lane—down another,
through this turn-pike—over that, as if
the arch-jockey of jockeys had got behind
me. 
Now ride at this rate with what good
intention and resolution you may,—'tis
a million to one you'll do some one a 

mischief, if not yourself—He's flung— 
he's off—he's lost his seat—he's down— 
he'll break his neck—see!—if he has not
galloped full amongst the scaffolding of
the undertaking criticks!—he'll knock
his brains out against some of their posts
—he's bounced out!—look—he's now
riding like a madcap full tilt through a
whole crowd of painters, fiddlers, poets,
biographers, physicians, lawyers, logicians,
players, schoolmen, churchmen,
statesmen, soldiers, casuists, connoisseurs,
prelates, popes, and engineers—Don't
fear, said I—I'll not hurt the poorest
jack-ass upon the king's high-way—But
your horse throws dirt; see you've splash'd
a bishop—I hope in God, 'twas only
Ernulphus, said I—But you have squirted
full in the faces of Mess. Le Mayne, De
Romigny, and De Marcilly, doctors of
the Sorbonne—That was last year, replied 

I—But you have trod this moment
upon a king. —Kings have bad times
on't, said I, to be trod upon by such
people as me. 
—You have done it, replied my accuser. 
I deny it, quoth I, and so have got off,
and here am I standing with my bridle
in one hand, and with my cap in the
other, to tell my story—And what is it? 
You shall hear in the next chapter.
