I will not enumerate the various inquiries and
conjectures which the&longs;e incidents occa&longs;ioned. After
all our efforts, we came no nearer to di&longs;pelling the
mi&longs;t in which they were involved; and time, in&longs;tead
of facilitating a &longs;olution, only accumulated our
doubts.
In the mid&longs;t of thoughts excited by the&longs;e events,
I was not unmindful of my interview with the
&longs;tranger. I related the particulars, and &longs;hewed the
portrait to my friends. Pleyel recollected to have
met with a figure re&longs;embling my de&longs;cription in the
city; but neither his face or garb made the &longs;ame impression
upon him that it made upon me. It was a
hint to rally me upon my prepo&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;ions, and to
amu&longs;e us with a thou&longs;and ludicrous anecdotes which
he had collected in his travels. He made no &longs;cruple
to charge me with being in love; and threatened to
inform the &longs;wain, when he met him, of his good
fortune.
Pleyel's temper made him &longs;u&longs;ceptible of no durable
impre&longs;&longs;ions. His conver&longs;ation was occasionally
vi&longs;ited by gleams of his ancient vivacity; but,
though his impetuo&longs;ity was &longs;ometimes inconvenient,
there was nothing to dread from his malice. I had
no fear that my character or dignity would &longs;uffer
in his hands, and was not heartily di&longs;plea&longs;ed when
he declared his intention of profiting by his fir&longs;t
meeting with the &longs;tranger to introduce him to our
acquaintance.
Some weeks after this I had &longs;pent a toil&longs;ome day,
and, as the &longs;un declined, found my&longs;elf di&longs;po&longs;ed to





&longs;eek relief in a walk. The river bank is, at this
part of it, and for &longs;ome con&longs;iderable &longs;pace upward,
&longs;o rugged and &longs;teep as not to be ea&longs;ily de&longs;cended.
In a rece&longs;s of this declivity, near the &longs;outhern verge
of my little deme&longs;ne, was placed a &longs;light building,
with &longs;eats and lattices. From a crevice of the
rock, to which this edifice was attached, there bur&longs;t
forth a &longs;tream of the pure&longs;t water, which, leaping
from ledge to ledge, for the &longs;pace of &longs;ixty feet,
produced a fre&longs;hne&longs;s in the air, and a murmur, the
mo&longs;t delicious and &longs;oothing imaginable. The&longs;e,
added to the odours of the cedars which embowered
it, and of the honey-&longs;uckle which clu&longs;tered among the
lattices, rendered this my favorite retreat in &longs;ummer.
On this occa&longs;ion I repaired hither. My &longs;pirits
drooped through the fatigue of long attention, and
I threw my&longs;elf upon a bench, in a &longs;tate, both
mentally and per&longs;onally, of the utmo&longs;t &longs;upinene&longs;s.
The lulling &longs;ounds of the waterfall, the fragrance
and the du&longs;k combined to becalm my &longs;pirits, and,
in a &longs;hort time, to &longs;ink me into &longs;leep. Either the
unea&longs;ine&longs;s of my po&longs;ture, or &longs;ome &longs;light indisposition
mole&longs;ted my repo&longs;e with dreams of no cheerful
hue. After various incoherences had taken
their turn to occupy my fancy, I at length imagined
my&longs;elf walking, in the evening twilight, to
my brother's habitation. A pit, methought, had
been dug in the path I had taken, of which I was
not aware. As I carele&longs;&longs;ly pur&longs;ued my walk, I
thought I &longs;aw my brother, &longs;tanding at &longs;ome distance
before me, beckoning and calling me to make
ha&longs;te. He &longs;tood on the oppo&longs;ite edge of the gulph.
I mended my pace, and one &longs;tep more would have
plunged me into this aby&longs;s, had not &longs;ome one from
behind caught &longs;uddenly my arm, and exclaimed, in
a voice of eagerne&longs;s and terror, “Hold! hold!”






The &longs;ound broke my &longs;leep, and I found my&longs;elf,
at the next moment, &longs;tanding on my feet, and surrounded
by the deepe&longs;t darkne&longs;s. Images &longs;o terrific
and forcible di&longs;abled me, for a time, from distinguishing
between &longs;leep and wakefulne&longs;s, and withheld
from me the knowledge of my actual condition.
My fir&longs;t panics were &longs;ucceeded by the perturbations
of &longs;urprize, to find my&longs;elf alone in the
open air, and immer&longs;ed in &longs;o deep a gloom. I
&longs;lowly recollected the incidents of the afternoon,
and how I came hither. I could not e&longs;timate the
time, but &longs;aw the propriety of returning with &longs;peed
to the hou&longs;e. My faculties were &longs;till too confu&longs;ed,
and the darkne&longs;s too inten&longs;e, to allow me immediately
to find my way up the &longs;teep. I &longs;at down,
therefore, to recover my&longs;elf, and to reflect upon
my &longs;ituation.
This was no &longs;ooner done, than a low voice was
heard from behind the lattice, on the &longs;ide where I
&longs;at. Between the rock and the lattice was a cha&longs;m
not wide enough to admit a human body; yet, in
this cha&longs;m he that &longs;poke appeared to be &longs;tationed.
“Attend! attend! but be not terrified.”
I &longs;tarted and exclaimed, “Good heavens! what
is that? Who are you?”
“A friend; one come, not to injure, but to &longs;ave
you; fear nothing.”
This voice was immediately recognized to be the
&longs;ame with one of tho&longs;e which I had heard in the
clo&longs;et; it was the voice of him who had propo&longs;ed
to &longs;hoot, rather than to &longs;trangle, his victim. My
terror made me, at once, mute and motionle&longs;s. He
continued, “I leagued to murder you. I repent.
Mark my bidding, and be &longs;afe. Avoid this &longs;pot.
The &longs;nares of death encompa&longs;s it. El&longs;ewhere
danger will be di&longs;tant; but this &longs;pot, &longs;hun it as you




value your life. Mark me further; profit by this
warning, but divulge it not. If a &longs;yllable of what
has pa&longs;&longs;ed e&longs;cape you, your doom is &longs;ealed. Remember
your father, and be faithful.”
Here the accents cea&longs;ed, and left me overwhelmed
with di&longs;may. I was fraught with the per&longs;ua&longs;ion,
that during every moment I remained here, my
life was endangered; but I could not take a &longs;tep
without hazard of falling to the bottom of the precipice.
The path, leading to the &longs;ummit, was
&longs;hort, but rugged and intricate. Even &longs;tar-light
was excluded by the umbrage, and not the fainte&longs;t
gleam was afforded to guide my &longs;teps. What
&longs;hould I do? To depart or remain was equally
and eminently perilous.
In this &longs;tate of uncertainty, I perceived a ray flit
acro&longs;s the gloom and di&longs;appear. Another succeeded,
which was &longs;tronger, and remained for a pa&longs;&longs;ing
moment. It glittered on the &longs;hrubs that were scattered
at the entrance, and gleam continued to succeed
gleam for a few &longs;econds, till they, finally,
gave place to unintermitted darkne&longs;s.
The fir&longs;t vi&longs;itings of this light called up a train
of horrors in my mind; de&longs;truction impended over
this &longs;pot; the voice which I had lately heard had
warned me to retire, and had menaced me with the
fate of my father if I refu&longs;ed. I was de&longs;irous, but
unable, to obey; the&longs;e gleams were &longs;uch as preluded
the &longs;troke by which he fell; the hour, perhaps,
was the &longs;ame—I &longs;huddered as if I had beheld,
&longs;u&longs;pended over me, the exterminating &longs;word.
Pre&longs;ently a new and &longs;tronger illumination bur&longs;t
through the lattice on the right hand, and a voice,
from the edge of the precipice above, called out my
name. It was Pleyel. Joyfully did I recognize
his accents; but &longs;uch was the tumult of my thoughts




that I had not power to an&longs;wer him till he had frequently
repeated his &longs;ummons. I hurried, at length,
from the fatal &longs;pot, and, directed by the lanthorn
which he bore, a&longs;cended the hill.
Pale and breathie&longs;s, it was with difficulty I could
&longs;upport my&longs;elf. He anxiou&longs;ly inquired into the
cau&longs;e of my affright, and the motive of my unusual
ab&longs;ence. He had returned from my brother's
at a late hour, and was informed by Judith, that I
had walked out before &longs;un-&longs;et, and had not yet returned.
This intelligence was &longs;omewhat alarming.
He waited &longs;ome time; but, my ab&longs;ence continuing,
he had &longs;et out in &longs;earch of me. He had explored
the neighbourhood with the utmo&longs;t care, but, receiving
no tidings of me, he was preparing to acquaint
my brother with this circum&longs;tance, when he
recollected the &longs;ummer-hou&longs;e on the bank, and conceived
it po&longs;&longs;ible that &longs;ome accident had detained
me there. He again inquired into the cau&longs;e of this
detention, and of that confu&longs;ion and di&longs;may which
my looks te&longs;tified.
I told him that I had &longs;trolled hither in the afternoon,
that &longs;leep had overtaken me as I &longs;at, and that
I had awakened a few minutes before his arrival.
I could tell him no more. In the pre&longs;ent impetuosity
of my thoughts, I was almo&longs;t dubious, whether
the pit, into which my brother had endeavoured
to entice me, and the voice that talked through the
lattice, were not parts of the &longs;ame dream. I remembered,
likewi&longs;e, the charge of &longs;ecrecy, and the
penatly denounced, if I &longs;hould ra&longs;hly divulge what
I had heard. For the&longs;e rea&longs;ons, I was &longs;ilent on
that &longs;ubject, and &longs;hutting my&longs;elf in my chamber,
delivered my&longs;elf up to contemplation.
What I have related will, no doubt, appear to
you a fable. You will believe that calamity has





&longs;ubverted my rea&longs;on, and that I am amu&longs;ing you
with the chimeras of my brain, in&longs;tead of facts that
have really happened. I &longs;hall not be &longs;urprized or
offened, if the&longs;e be your &longs;u&longs;picions. I know not,
indeed, how you can deny them admi&longs;&longs;ion. For,
if to me, the immediate witne&longs;s, they were fertile of
perplexity and doubt, how mu&longs;t they affect another
to whom they are recommended only by my testimony?
It was only by &longs;ub&longs;equent events, that I
was fully and inconte&longs;tibly a&longs;&longs;ured of the veracity
of my &longs;en&longs;es.
Meanwhile what was I to think? I had been
a&longs;&longs;ured that a de&longs;ign had been formed again&longs;t my
life. The ruffians had leagued to murder me.
Whom had I offended? Who was there with
whom I had ever maintained intercour&longs;e, who was
capable of harbouring &longs;uch atrocious purpo&longs;es?
My temper was the rever&longs;e of cruel and imperious.
My heart was touched with &longs;ympathy for
the children of misfortune. But this &longs;ympathy was
not a barren &longs;entiment. My pur&longs;e, &longs;canty as it
was, was ever open, and my hands ever active, to
relieve di&longs;tre&longs;s. Many were the wretches whom
my per&longs;onal exertions had extricated from want and
di&longs;ea&longs;e, and who rewarded me with their gratitude.
There was no face which lowered at my approach,
and no lips which uttered imprecations in my hearing.
On the contrary, there was none, over who&longs;e
fate I had exerted any influence, or to whom I
was known by reputation, who did not greet me
with &longs;miles, and di&longs;mi&longs;s me with proofs of veneration;
yet did not my &longs;en&longs;es a&longs;&longs;ure me that a plot
was laid again&longs;t my life?
I am not de&longs;titute of courage, I have &longs;hewn
my&longs;elf deliberative and calm in the mid&longs;t of peril.
I have hazarded my own life, for the pre&longs;ervation




of another, but now was I confu&longs;ed and panic
&longs;truck. I have not lived &longs;o as to fear death, yet
to peri&longs;h by an un&longs;een and &longs;ecret &longs;troke, to be
mangled by the knife of an a&longs;&longs;a&longs;&longs;in, was a thought
at which I &longs;huddered; what had I done to de&longs;erve
to be made the victim of malignant pa&longs;&longs;ions?
But &longs;oft! was I not a&longs;&longs;ured, that my life was
&longs;afe in all places but one? And why was the treason
limited to take effect in this &longs;pot? I was every
where equally defencele&longs;s. My hou&longs;e and chamber
were, at all times, acce&longs;&longs;ible. Danger &longs;till impended
over me; the bloody purpo&longs;e was &longs;till entertained,
but the hand that was to execute it, was
powerle&longs;s in all places but one!
Here I had remained for the la&longs;t four or five
hours, without the means of re&longs;i&longs;tance or defence,
yet I had not been attacked. A human being was
at hand, who was con&longs;cious of my pre&longs;ence, and
warned me hereafter to avoid this retreat. His
voice was not ab&longs;olutely new, but had I never
heard it but once before? But why did he prohibit
me from relating this incident to others, and
what &longs;pecies of death will be awarded if I di&longs;obey?
He talked of my father. He intimated, that disclosure
would pull upon my head, the &longs;ame destruction.
Was then the death of my father, portentous
and inexplicable as it was, the con&longs;equence
of human machinations? It &longs;hould &longs;eem, that this
being is appri&longs;ed of the true nature of this event,
and is con&longs;cious of the means that led to it. Whether
it &longs;hall likewi&longs;e fall upon me, depends upon
the ob&longs;ervance of &longs;ilence. Was it the infraction
of a &longs;imilar command, that brought &longs; horrible a
penalty upon my father?
Such were the reflections that haunted me during
the night, and which effectually deprived me of




&longs;leep. Next morning, at breakfa&longs;t, Pleyel related
an event which my di&longs;appearance had hindered him
from mentioning the night before. Early the preceding
morning, his occa&longs;ions called him to the
city; he had &longs;tepped into a coffee-hou&longs;e to while
away an hour; here he had met a per&longs;on who&longs;e
appearance in&longs;tantly be&longs;poke him to be the &longs;ame
who&longs;e ha&longs;ty vi&longs;it I have mentioned, and who&longs;e
extraordinary vi&longs;age and tones had &longs;o powerfully
affected me. On an attentive &longs;urvey, however,
he proved, likewi&longs;e, to be one with whom my
friend had had &longs;ome intercour&longs;e in Europe. This
authori&longs;ed the liberty of acco&longs;ting him, and after
&longs;ome conver&longs;ation, mindful, as Pleyel &longs;aid, of the
footing which this &longs;tranger had gained in my heart,
he had ventured to invite him to Mettingen. The
invitation had been cheerfully accepted, and a vi&longs;it
promi&longs;ed on the afternoon of the next day.
This information excited no &longs;ober emotions in
my brea&longs;t. I was, of cour&longs;e, eager to be informed
as to the circum&longs;tances of their ancient intercour&longs;e.
When, and where had they met? What knew
he of the life and character of this man?
In an&longs;wer to my inquiries, he informed me that,
three years before, he was a traveller in Spain. He
had made an excur&longs;ion from Valencia to Murviedro,
with a view to in&longs;pect the remains of Roman
magnificence, &longs;cattered in the environs of that town.
While traver&longs;ing the &longs;cite of the theatre of old
Saguntum, he lighted upon this man, &longs;eated on a
&longs;tone, and deeply engaged in peru&longs;ing the work of
the deacon Marti. A &longs;hort conver&longs;ation en&longs;ued,
which proved the &longs;tranger to be Engli&longs;h. They
returned to Valencia together.
His garb, a&longs;pect, and deportment, were wholly
Spani&longs;h. A re&longs;idence of three years in the




country, indefatigable attention to the language, and a
&longs;tudious conformity with the cu&longs;toms of the people,
had made him indi&longs;ting ui&longs;hable from a native, when
he cho&longs;e to a&longs;&longs;ume that character. Pleyel found
him to be connected, on the footing of friend&longs;hip and
re&longs;pect, with many eminent merchants in that city.
He had embraced the catholic religion, and adopted
a Spani&longs;h name in&longs;tead of his own, which was
Carwin, and devoted him&longs;elf to the literature and
religion of his new country. He pur&longs;ued no profession,
but &longs;ub&longs;i&longs;ted on remittances from England.
While Pleyel remained in Valencia, Carwin betrayed
no aver&longs;ion to intercour&longs;e, and the former
found no &longs;mall attractions in the &longs;ociety of this new
acquaintance. On general topics he was highly
intelligent and communicative. He had vi&longs;ited every
corner of Spain, and could furni&longs;h the mo&longs;t accurate
details re&longs;pecting its ancient and pre&longs;ent &longs;tate.
On topics of religion and of his own hi&longs;tory, previous
to his transformation into a Spaniard, he
was invariably &longs;ilent. You could merely gather
from his di&longs;cour&longs;e that he was Engli&longs;h, and that he
was well acquainted with the neighbouring countries.

His character excited con&longs;iderable curio&longs;ity in
this ob&longs;erver. It was not ea&longs;y to reconcile his conversion
to the Romi&longs;h faith, with tho&longs;e proofs of
knowledge and capacity that were exhibited by him
on different occa&longs;ions. A &longs;u&longs;picion was, &longs;ometimes,
admitted, that his belief was counterfeited for &longs;ome
political purpo&longs;e. The mo&longs;t careful ob&longs;ervation,
however, produced no di&longs;covery. His manners
were, at all times, harmle&longs;s and inartificial, and his
habits tho&longs;e of a lover of contemplation and seclusion.
He appeared to have contracted an affection
for Pleyel, who was not &longs;low to return it.






My friend, after a month's re&longs;idence in this city,
returned into France, and, &longs;ince that period, had
heard nothing concerning Carwin till his appearance
at Mettingen.
On this occa&longs;ion Carwin had received Pleyel's
greeting with a certain di&longs;tance and &longs;olemnity to
which the latter had not been accu&longs;tomed. He had
waved noticing the inquiries of Pleyel re&longs;pecting
his de&longs;ertion of Spain, in which he had formerly declared
that it was his purpo&longs;e to &longs;pend his life. He
had a&longs;&longs;iduou&longs;ly divertted the attention of the latter
to indifferent topics, but was &longs;till, on every theme,
as eloquent and judicious as formerly. Why he
had a&longs;&longs;umed the garb of a ru&longs;tic, Pleyel was unable
to conjecture. Perhaps it might be poverty,
perhaps he was &longs;wayed by motives which it was
his intere&longs;t to conceal, but which were connected
with con&longs;equences of the utmo&longs;t moment.
Such was the &longs;um of my friend's information.
I was not &longs;orry to be left alone during the greater
part of this day. Every employment was irk&longs;ome
which did not leave me at liberty to meditate. I
had now a new &longs;ubject on which to exerci&longs;e my
thoughts. Before evening I &longs;hould be u&longs;hered into
his pre&longs;ence, and li&longs;ten to tho&longs;e tones who&longs;e magical
and thrilling power I had already experienced.
But with what new images would he then be accompanied?

Carwin was an adherent to the Romi&longs;h faith,
yet was an Engli&longs;hman by birth, and, perhaps, a
prote&longs;tant by education. He had adopted Spain
for his country, and had intimated a de&longs;ign to &longs;pend
his days there, yet now was an inhabitant of this
di&longs;trict, and di&longs;gui&longs;ed by the habiliments of a
clown! What could have obliterated the impressions
of his youth, and made him abjure his religion




and his country? What &longs;ub&longs;equent events had introduced
&longs;o total a change in his plans? In withdrawing
from Spain, had he reverted to the religion
of his ance&longs;tors; or was it true, that his former
conver&longs;ion was deceitful, and that his conduct had
been &longs;wayed by motives which it was prudent to
conceal?
Hours were con&longs;umed in revolving the&longs;e ideas.
My mediatations were inten&longs;e; and, when the &longs;eries
was broken, I began to reflect with a&longs;toni&longs;hment on
my &longs;ituation. From the death of my parents, till
the commencement of this year, my life had been
&longs;erene and bli&longs;sful, beyond the ordinary portion of
humanity; but, now, my bo&longs;om was corroded by
anxiety. I was vi&longs;ited by dread of unknown dangers,
and the future was a &longs;cene over which clouds
rolled, and thunders muttered. I compared the
cau&longs;e with the effect, and they &longs;eemed disproportioned
to each other. All unaware, and in a
manner which I had no power to explain, I was
pu&longs;hed from my immoveable and lo&longs;ty &longs;tation, and
ca&longs;t upon a &longs;ea of troubles.
I determined to be my brother's vi&longs;itant on this
evening, yet my re&longs;olves were not unattended with
wavering and reluctance. Pleyel's in&longs;inuations that
I was in love, affected, in no degree, my belief, yet
the con&longs;ciou&longs;ne&longs;s that this was the opinion of one
who would, probably, be pre&longs;ent at our introduction
to each other, would excite all that confusion
which the pa&longs;&longs;ion it&longs;elf is apt to produce.
This would confirm him in his error, and call forth
new railleries. His mirth, when exerted upon this
topic, was the &longs;ource of the bittere&longs;t vexation.
Had he been aware of its influence upon my happiness,
his temper would not have allowed him to
per&longs;i&longs;t; but this influence, it was my chief




endeavour to conceal. That the belief of my having
be&longs;towed my heart upon another, produced in my
friend none but ludicrous &longs;en&longs;ations, was the true
cau&longs;e of my di&longs;tre&longs;s; but if this had been discovered
by him, my di&longs;tre&longs;s would have been unspeakably
aggravated.
