The art of borrowing further explained; and an
account of a strange phænomenon. 
In this manner did the artful incendiary
work upon the passions of the credulous unsuspecting
Hungarian, who pressed him to his
breast with the most cordial expressions of
friendship, calling him his guardian, his saviour,
his second father, and gave himself up wholly
to his advice. 
Next morning, according to the plan they
had laid over night, they repaired to a tavern
in the neighbourhood of the person to whom
our adventurer had been directed, and were fortunate
enough to find him in the house, transacting
a money affair with a young gentleman
who treated him with his morning's whet. 
That affair being negotiated, he adjourned
into another room with Renaldo and his companion,
who were not a little surprised to see
this minister of Plutus in the shape of a young
sprightly beau, trimmed up in all the foppery 

of the fashion; for they had hitherto always
associated with the idea of an usurer, old age
and rusty apparel. After divers modish congees,
he begged to know to what he should
attribute the honour of their message; when
Ferdinand, who acted the orator, told him,
that his friend Count Melvil, having occasion
for a sum of money, had been directed to a
gentleman of his name, “and I suppose,” added
he, “you are the son of the person with
whom the affair is to be negotiated.” 
“Sir,” said this petit maitre, with a smile,
“I perceive you are surprized to see one of my
profession in the appearance of a gentleman; 
and perhaps your wonder will not cease, when
I tell you, that my education was liberal, and
that I once had the honour to bear a commission
in the British army. I was indeed a first lieutenant
of marines, and will venture to say, that
no officer in the service was more delicate than
myself, in observing all the punctilios of honour. 
I entertained the utmost contempt for
all the trading part of the nation, and suffered
myself to be run through the body in a duel,
rather than roll with a brother-lieutenant who
was a broker's son: but, thank Heaven! I
have long ago conquered all those ridiculous
prejudices. I soon observed, that without
money there was no respect, honour, or convenience
to be acquired in life; that wealth
amply supplied the want of wit, merit and
pedigree, having influence and pleasure ever
at command; and that the world never failed
to worship the flood of affluence, without examining
the dirty channels thro' which it commonly flowed. 

At the end of the war, finding my appointments
reduced to two shillings and four-pence
per day, and being addicted to pleasures which
I could not possibly purchase from such a fund,
I sold my half-pay for two hundred pounds,
which I lent upon bond to a young officer of
the same regiment, on condition that he should
insure his life, and restore one fourth part of
the sum by way of premium. I happened to be
lucky in this first essay: for the borrower, having
in six weeks expended the money, made an
excursion on the high-way, was apprehended,
tried, convicted of felony, and cut his own
throat, to prevent the shame of a public execution; 
so that his bond was discharged by the
insurers. 
In short, gentlemen, when I engaged in this
business, I determined to carry it on with such
spirit, as would either make my fortune, or entirely
ruin me in a little time; and hitherto
my endeavours have been tolerably successful:
nor do I think my proceedings a whit more
criminal or unjust, than those of other merchants,
who strive to turn their money to the
best account. The commodity I deal in is cash,
and it is my business to sell it to the best advantage. 
A London factor sends a cargo of
goods to market, and if he gets two hundred
per cent. upon the sale, he is commended for his
industry and address. If I sell money for one
fourth part of that profit, certain persons will
be so unjust, as to cry, Shame upon me, for
taking such advantage of my neighbour's distress:
not considering, that the trader took
four times the same advantage of those people
who bought his cargo, tho' his risque was not 

half so great as mine; and although the money
I sold, perhaps retrieved the borrower from
the very jaws of destruction: for example, it was
but yesterday I saved a worthy man from being
arrested for a sum of money, for which he
had bailed a friend who treacherously left him
in the lurch: as he did not foresee what would
happen, he had made no provision for the demand,
and his sphere of life secluding him from
all sorts of money'd intercourse, he could not
raise the cash by his credit in the usual way
of borrowing; so that, without my assistance,
he must have gone to jail; a disgrace
which would have proved fatal to the peace of
his family, and utterly ruined his reputation. 
—Nay, that very young gentleman from whom
I just now parted, will, in all probability, be indebted
to me for a very genteel livelihood. He
had obtained the absolute promise of being
provided for, by a great man, who sits at the
helm of affairs in a neighbouring kingdom; 
but being destitute of all other resources, he
could not have equipped himself for the
voyage, in order to profit by his lordship's intention,
unless I had enabled him to pursue his
good fortune.” 
Renaldo was not a little pleased to hear this
harrangue to which Fathom replied with many
florid encomiums upon the usurer's good sense
and humane disposition; then he explained the
errand of his friend, which was to borrow three
hundred pounds, in order to retrieve his inheritance,
of which he had been defrauded in his
absence. 
“Sir, (said the lender, addressing himself to
Count Melvil), I pretend to have acquired by 

experience some skill in physiognomy; and
though there are some faces so deeply disguised
as to baffle all the penetration of our art,
there are others, in which the heart appears
with such nakedness of integrity, as at once
to recommend it to our good will. —I own
your countenance prepossesses me in your favour; 
and you shall be accommodated, upon
those terms from which I never deviate, provided
you can find proper security, that you
shall not quit the British dominions; for that,
with me, is a condition sine qua non.” 
This was a very disagreeable declaration to
Renaldo, who candidly owned, that as his
concerns lay upon the continent, his purpose
was to leave England without delay. The
usurer professed himself sorry that it was not
in his power to oblige him; and, in order to
prevent any farther importunity, assured them,
he had laid it down as a maxim, from which
he would never swerve, to avoid all dealings
with people whom (if need should be) he
could not sue by the laws of this realm. 
Thus the intervention of one unlucky and
unforeseen circumstance blasted, in an instant,
the budding hopes of Melvile, who, while his
visage exhibited the most sorrowful disappointment,
begged to know, if there was any person
of his acquaintance, who might be less
scrupulous in that particular. 
The young gentleman directed them to another
member of his profession, and wishing
them success, took his leave with great form
and complaisance. This instance of politeness
was, however, no more than a shift to disengage himself the more easily from their intreaties: 

for, when the case was opened to
the second usurer, he blessed himself from
such customers, and dismissed them with the
most mortifying and boorish refusal. Notwithstanding
these repulses, Renaldo resolved
to make one desperate push; and, without allowing
himself the least respite, sollicited, one
by one, not fewer than fifteen persons who
dealt in this kind of traffic, and his proposals
were rejected by each. At last, fatigued by
the toil, and exasperated at the ill success of
his expedition; and half mad with the recollection
of his finances, which were now drained
to half a crown, “Since we have nothing
to expect,” cried he, “from the favour of
Christians, let us have recourse to the descendants
of Judah. Though they lie under
the general reproach of nations, as a people
dead to virtue and benevolence, and wholly
devoted to avarice, fraud, and extortion, the
most savage of their tribe cannot treat me
with more barbarity of indifference, than I
have experienced among those who are the authors
of their reproach.” 
Although Fathom looked upon this proposal
as an extravagant symptom of despair, he
affected to approve of the scheme, and encouraged
Renaldo with the hope of succeeding
in another quarter, even if this expedition
should fail: for, by this time, our adventurer
was half resolved to export him at his own
charge, rather than he should be much longer
restricted in his designs upon Monimia. 
Mean while, being resolved to try the experiment
upon the children of Israel, they betook
themselves to the house of a rich Jew, 

whose wealth they considered as a proof of
his rapaciousness; and, being admitted into
his compting house, they found him, in the
midst of half a dozen clerks, when Renaldo,
in his imagination, likened him unto a minister
of darkness surrounded by his familiars,
and planning schemes of misery to be executed
upon the hapless sons of men. In spite of
these suggestions, which were not at all mitigated
by the forbidding aspect of the Hebrew,
he demanded a private audience; and, being
ushered into another apartment, he explained
his business with manifest marks of disorder
and affliction. Indeed his confusion was in
some measure owing to the looks of the Jew,
who in the midst of his exordium pulled down
his eye-brows, which were surprisingly black
and bushy, so as, in appearance, totally, to extinguish
his vision, though he was all the time
observing our youth from behind those almost
impenetrable thickets. 
Melvil having signified his request, “Young
gentleman, (said the Israelite, with a most discordant
voice) what in the name of goodness,
could induce you to come to me, upon such
an errand? Did you ever hear that I lent money
to strangers, without security?” “No,” 
replied Renaldo; “nor did I believe I should
profit by my application: but my affairs are desperate; 
and my proposals having been rejected
by every Christian to whom they were offered,
I was resolved to try my fate among the
Jews, who are reckoned another species of
men.” 
Fathom, alarmed at this abrupt reply, which
he supposed could not fail to disgust the merchant, 

interposed in the conversation, by making
an apology for the plain dealing of his
friend, who, he said, was soured and ruffled
by his misfortune: then exerting that power
of eloquence which he had at command, he
expostulated upon Renaldo's claim and expectations,
described the wrongs he had suffered,
extolled his virtue, and drew a most pathetic
picture of his distress. 
The Jew listened attentively for some time; 
then his eye-brows began to rise and fall alternately; 
he cough'd, sneez'd, and winking
hard, “I am plagued,” said he, “with a salt
rheum that trickles from my eyes without intermission.” 
So saying, he wiped the moisture
from his face, and proceeded in these
words: “Sir, your story is plausible; and
your friend is a good advocate: but, before I
give an answer to your demand, I must beg
leave to ask if you can produce undeniable evidence
of your being the identical person you
really assume. If you are really the Count de
Melvil, you will excuse my caution: we cannot
be too much on our guard against fraud; 
though I must own you have not the air of an
impostor.” 
Renaldo's eyes began to sparkle at this preliminary
question; to which he replied, that
he could procure the testimony of the Emperor's
minister, to whom he had occasionally
paid his respects since his first arrival in England. 
“If that be the case,” said the Jew, “take
the trouble to call here to-morrow morning at
eight o'clock, and I will carry you in my own
coach to the house of his excellency, with 

whom I have the honour to be acquainted; 
and if he has nothing to object against your
character, or pretensions, I will contribute my
assistance towards your obtaining justice at the
imperial court.” 
The Hungarian was so much confounded at
this unexpected reception, that he had not
power to thank the merchant for his promised
favour, but stood motionless and silent, while
the streams of gratitude ran down his cheeks. 
This genuine emotion of the heart was of
more weight with the Jew, than the eloquent
acknowledgment which Ferdinand took the
opportunity of making for his friend; and
he was fain to dismiss them a little abruptly, in
order to prevent a second discharge of that
same rheum of which he had already complained. 
Melvil recollected all that had happened as
a dream, which had no foundation in truth,
and was all day long in a sort of delirium,
produced by the alternate gusts of hope and
fear that still agitated his bosom: for he was
not yet without apprehension of being again
disappointed by some unlucky occurrence. 
He did not, however, fail to be punctual to
the hour of his appointment, when the Jew
told him, there would be no occasion for visiting
the ambassador, because Renaldo had been,
the preceding day, recognised by one of the
clerks who had been employed as a purveyor
in the imperial army; and who, knowing his
family, confirmed every thing he had alledged. 
“After breakfast,” continued this benevolent
Israelite, “I will give you an order upon my
banker for five hundred pounds, that you may 

be enabled to appear at Vienna, as the son and
representative of Count Melvil; and you shall
also be furnished with a letter of recommendation
to a person of some influence at that
court, whose friendship and countenance may
be of some service to your suit: for I am now
heartily engaged in your interest, in consequence
of the fair and unblemished character
which I find you have hitherto maintained.” 
The reader must appeal to his own heart
to acquire a just idea of Renaldo's feelings,
when every title of these promises was fulfilled,
and the merchant refused to take one
farthing by way of premium, contenting himself
with the slender security of a personal
bond. He was, in truth, overwhelmed with
the obligation, and certainly disposed to believe,
that his benefactor was something more
than human. As for Fathom, his sentiments
took a different turn; and he scrupled not to
impute all this kindness to some deep-laid interested
scheme, the scope of which he could
not at present comprehend. 
After the tumults of the young gentleman's
joy had subsided, and he found himself eased
of that burthensome poverty, under which he
had groaned so long; his thoughts, which before
were dissipated upon the various circumstances
of distress, began to collect themselves
in a body, and to resume their deliberations
upon a subject which they had been long accustomed
to consider; this was no other than
the forlorn Monimia, whose idea now emerged
in his bosom, being disencumbered of one part
of the load by which it had been depressed. 
He mentioned her name to Fathom, with 

marks of the most melting compassion, deplored
her apostasy; and, while he protested
that he had devorced her for ever from his
heart, expressed an inclination to see her once
more, before his departure, that he might in
person exhort her to penitence and reformation. 
Our adventurer, who dreaded such an interview
as the infallible means of his own ruin,
resisted the proposal with the whole power of
his elocution. He affirmed, that Renaldo's
desire was a manifest proof that he still retained
part of the fatal poison which that inchantress
had spread within his veins, and that the
sight of her, softened by his reproaches into
tears and affected contrition, would despel his
resentment, disable his manhood, and blow
the embers of his former passion to such a
rage, as would hurry him on to a reconciliation,
which would debase his honour, and
ruin his future peace. In a word, Ferdinand
described the danger that would attend the
meeting, in such emphatic terms, that the
Hungarian started with horror at the picture
which he drew, and in this particular conformed
with the admonition of his friend. 
One hundred pounds of the Jew's money
was immediately appropriated for the payment
of his most urgent debts; the like sum he presented
to his friend Fathom, with a solemn
promise of sharing with him whatever good
fortune might await him in Germany: and
tho' Monimia had forfeited all title to his regard,
so ill could he bear the prospect of her
distress, that he entrusted his dear companion
with the half of what remained, to be expended 

for her use, fully resolving to screen her
from the shocks and temptations of want, as
the circumstances of his future fate would allow. 
Fathom, far from opposing, applauded his
generosity with marks of extreme wonder and
admiration, assuring him, that she should be
put in possession of his bounty, immediately
after his departure, he being unwilling to
make her acquainted with her good fortune
before that period, lest finding his affairs in a
fair way of being retrieved, she should be base
enough to worship his returning prosperity,
and, by false professions, and artful blandishments,
seek to ensnare his heart anew.
