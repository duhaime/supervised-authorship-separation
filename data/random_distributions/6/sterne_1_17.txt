C'est bien comique, 'tis very
droll, said the lady smiling, from
the reflection that this was the second
time we had been left together
by a parcel of nonsensical
contingencies—c'est bien comique, said
she— 
—There wants nothing, said I, to
make it so, but the comick use
which the gallantry of a Frenchman
would put it to—to make love
the first moment, and an offer of his
person the second. 

'Tis their fort: replied the lady. 
It is supposed so at least—and how
it has come to pass, continued I, I
know not; but they have certainly
got the credit of understanding more
of love, and making it better than
any other nation upon earth: but for
my own part I think them errant
bunglers, and in truth the worst set
of marksmen that ever tried Cupid's
patience. 
—To think of making love by
sentiments! 
I should as soon think of making
a genteel suit of cloaths out of remnants:
—and to do it—pop—at first
sight by declaration—is submitting 

the offer and themselves with it, to
be sifted, with all their pours and
contres, by an unheated mind. 
The lady attended as if she expected
I should go on. 
Consider then, madam, continued
I, laying my hand upon hers— 
That grave people hate Love for
the name's sake— 
That selfish people hate it for their
own— 
Hypocrites for heaven's— 
And that all of us both old
and young, being ten times worse 

frighten'd than hurt by the very
report —What a want of knowledge
in this branch of commerce a man
betrays, whoever lets the word
come out of his lips, till an hour or
two at least after the time, that his
silence upon it becomes tormenting. 
A course of small, quiet attentions,
not so pointed as to alarm—nor so
vague as to be misunderstood,—with
now and then a look of kindness,
and little or nothing said upon it— 
leaves Nature for your mistress, and
she fashions it to her mind.— 
Then I solemnly declare, said the
lady, blushing—you have been making
love to me all this while.
