CHAP. I.

points, and increase it in others. 

p. 1
CHAP. II.

Contains some passages, which, perhaps, may be
looked upon as pretty extraordinary. 

13
CHAP. III.

Discovers to miss Betsy a piece of treachery she
little expected to hear of. 

25
CHAP. IV.

Has very little in it, besides a collection of letters,
some of which are much to the purpose, others
less so. 

42
CHAP. V.

Serves as a supplement to the former. 

56

CHAP. VI.

Seems to bring things pretty near a conclusion. 

67
CHAP. VII.

Is the better for being short. 

77
CHAP. VIII.

Contains some incidents which will be found equally
interesting and entertaining, or the author is
very much mistaken. 

84
CHAP. IX.

Is yet more interesting than the former. 

97
CHAP. X.

Cannot fail of exciting compassion in some readers,
though it may move others to laughter. 

109
CHAP. XI.

Shews what effects the transactions of the preceding
night had on the minds of miss Betsy and
mr. Trueworth. 

123
CHAP. XII.

Contains some passages, which, it is probable,
will afford more pain than pleasure, yet are
very pertinent to the history, and necessary to
be repeated. 

134

CHAP. XIII.

Is the recital of some accidents, as little possible to
be foreseen by the reader, as they were by the
persons to whom they happened. 

142
CHAP. XIV.

Gives a full explanation of some passages, which
hitherto have seemed very dark and mysterious. 

154
CHAP. XV.

Shews some part of the consequences, produced by
the foregoing occurrence. 

168
CHAP. XVI.

Is a kind of olio, a mixture of many things, all
of them very much to the purpose, though less
entertaining than some others. 

179
CHAP. XVII.

Contains only such things as the reader might reasonably
expect to have been informed of before. 

195
CHAP. XVIII.

Is of very small importance, yet contains such
things as the reader may expect to hear. 

209
CHAP. XIX.

Is multum in parvo. 

224

CHAP. XX.

Shews miss Betsy left entirely to her own management,
and the cause of it, with some other particulars. 

233
CHAP. XXI.

The author is under some apprehensions, will not
be quite pleasing to the humour of every
reader. 

245
CHAP. XXII.

Gives an account of a farther, and more laudable
motive, to induce mr. Trueworth to put off his
intended journey into the country. 

261
CHAP. XXIII.

Returns to miss Betsy's adventures, from which the
two former were but a digression, though a very
necessary one, as will hereafter appear.
