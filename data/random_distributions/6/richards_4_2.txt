If to Divert and Entertain, and at
the same time to Instruct and Improve
the Minds of the Youth of
both Sexes: 
IF to inculcate Religion and Morality
in so easy and agreeable a manner, as
shall render them equally delightful and
profitable: 
IF to set forth in the most exemplary
Lights, the Parental, the Filial, and the
Social Duties: 
IF to paint Vice in its proper Colours,
to make it deservedly Odious; and
to set Virtue in its own amiable Light,
to make it look Lovely: 

IF to draw Characters with Justness,
and to support them distinctly: 
IF to raise a Distress from natural
Causes, and excite a Compassion from just
ones: 
IF to teach the Man of Fortune how
to use it; the Man of Passion how to
subdue it; and the Man of Intrigue,
how, gracefully, and with Honour to himself,
to reclaim: 
IF to give practical Examples, worthy
to be follow'd in the most critical and
affecting Cases, by the Virgin, the Bride,
and the Wife: 
IF to effect all these good Ends, in
so probable, so natural, so lively a manner,
as shall engage the Passions of every
sensible Reader, and attach their Regard
to the Story: 
AND all without raising a single
Idea throughout the Whole, that shall shock
the exactest Purity, even in the warmest
of those Instances where Purity would be
most apprehensive: 

IF these be laudable or worthy Recommendations,
the Editor of the following Letters,
which have their Foundation both in Truth
and in Nature, ventures to assert, that
all these Ends are obtained here, together. 
CONFIDENT therefore of the
favourable Reception which he ventures
to bespeak for this little Work, he thinks
any Apology for it unnecessary: And
the rather for two Reasons, 1st, Because
he can appeal from his own Passions,
(which have been uncommonly moved in
perusing it) to the Passions of Every one
who shall read with Attention: And, in
the next place, because an Editor can judge
with an Impartiality which is rarely to
be found in an Author. 
&line;
THE foregoing is the Editor's Preface
to the Two first Volumes of this Piece, in
Twelves: And there were, moreover, prefix'd
to them, Two Recommendatory
Letters; as also to the Four latter Impressions,
an Introductory Preface, by an
ingenious Gentleman, who kindly undertook
to answer some Objections, made by well-meaning 

Persons, to a few Passages in the
Work. But it has been thought adviseable
to omit These, in the present Edition; 
because the kind Reception which these
Volumes have met with, renders the Recommendatory
Letters unnecessary; and
because the most material of the Objections
answer'd in the Introductory Preface, are
taken notice of and obviated in the Third
Volume, in Letters from the fair Writer
to Lady Davers, and others of her Correspondents. 
And their Place is supply'd,
not unusefully, it is presum'd, by the following
Epitome of the Work. 
THE editor has been much press'd
with Importunities and Conjectures in
relation to the Person and Family of the
incomparable Lady, who is the Subject of
these Volumes: All that he thinks himself
at Liberty to say, or is necessary to be said,
is only to repeat what has been already
hinted, That the Story has its Foundation
in Truth: And that there was a Necessity,
for obvious Reasons, to vary and
disguise some Facts and Circumstances, as
also the Names of Persons, Places, &c.
