—'Tis very true, said I, replying
to a cast upwards with
his eyes, with which he had concluded
his address—'tis very true— 
and heaven be their resource who
have no other but the charity of the
world, the stock of which, I fear, is
no way sufficient for the many great
claims which are hourly made upon
it. 
As I pronounced the words great
claims, he gave a slight glance with
his eye downwards upon the sleeve 

of his tunick —I felt the full force of
the appeal —I acknowledge it, said I
—a coarse habit, and that but once
in three years, with meagre diet— 
are no great matters; and the true
point of pity is, as they can be earn'd
in the world with so little industry,
that your order should wish to procure
them by pressing upon a fund
which is the property of the lame, the
blind, the aged, and the infirm—the
captive who lies down counting over
and over again the days of his afflictions,
languishes also for his share
of it; and had you been of the order
of mercy, instead of the order of St.
Francis, poor as I am, continued I,
pointing at my portmanteau, full
chearfully should it have been open'd 

to you, for the ransom of the unfortunate 
—The monk made me a bow
—but of all others, resumed I, the
unfortunate of our own country,
surely, have the first rights; and I
have left thousands in distress upon
our own shore —The monk gave a
cordial wave with his head—as much
as to say, No doubt, there is misery
enough in every corner of the world,
as well as within our convent —But
we distinguish, said I, laying my
hand upon the sleeve of his tunick,
in return for his appeal—we distinguish,
my good Father! betwixt
those who wish only to eat the bread
of their own labour—and those who
eat the bread of other people's, and
have no other plan in life, but to get 

through it in sloth and ignorance, for
the love of God. 
The poor Franciscan made no reply:
a hectic of a moment pass'd
across his cheek, but could not tarry 
—Nature seemed to have had done
with her resentments in him; he
shewed none—but letting his staff
fall within his arm, he press'd both
his hands with resignation upon his
breast, and retired.
