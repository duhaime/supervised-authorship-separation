Lady Grandison, To Ladies L. and G. 


Grandison-hall, Tuesd. Feb. 13. 
I write to my dearest sisters now. 
Nor will I ask you to send my Letters to my
grandmamma for the present. 
Lucy shall be left to entertain my Northamptonshire
friends. 
The inclosed translation of a Letter written by Signor
Jeronymo, will give you the surprising news— 
surprising indeed—Poor, poor Lady! 
I must tell you in my next, how we were all affected
on the receiving it: No more at present can I
add, but that I am, my dear Ladies, 
Your ever affectionate Sister,
Harriet Grandison.
