I Feel little reluctance in complying with your
reque&longs;t. You know not fully the cau&longs;e of my
&longs;orrows. You are a &longs;tranger to the depth of my
di&longs;tre&longs;&longs;es. Hence your efforts at con&longs;olation mu&longs;t
nece&longs;&longs;arily fail. Yet the tale that I am going to tell
is not intended as a claim upon your &longs;ympathy. In
the mid&longs;t of my de&longs;pair, I do not dildain to contribute
what little I can to the benefit of mankind.
I acknowledge your right to be informed of the
events that have lately happened in my family.
Make what u&longs;e of the tale you &longs;hall think proper.
If it be communicated to the world, it will inculcate
the duty of avoiding deceit. It will exemplify
the force of early impre&longs;&longs;ions, and &longs;how the immeasurable
evils that flow from an erroneous or
imperfect di&longs;cipline.
My &longs;tate is not de&longs;titute of tranquillity. The
&longs;entiment that dictates my feelings is not hope.
Futurity has no power over my thoughts. To all
that is to come I am perfectly indifferent. With




regard to my&longs;elf, I have nothing more to fear. Fate
has done its wor&longs;t. Henceforth, I am callous to
misfortune.
I addre&longs;s no &longs;upplication to the Deity. The
power that governs the cour&longs;e of human affairs has
cho&longs;en his path. The decree that a&longs;certained the
condition of my life, admits of no recal. No doubt
it &longs;quares with the maxims of eternal equity. That
is neither to be que&longs;tioned nor denied by me. It suffices
that the pa&longs;t is exempt from mutation. The
&longs;torm that tore up our happine&longs;s, and changed into
drearine&longs;s and de&longs;ert the blooming &longs;cene of our existence,
is lulled into grim repo&longs;e; but not until
the victim was transfixed and mangled; till every
ob&longs;tacle was di&longs;&longs;ipated by its rage; till every remnant
of good was wre&longs;ted from our gra&longs;p and exterminated.

How will your wonder, and that of your companions,
be excited by my &longs;tory! Every &longs;entiment
will yield to your amazement. If my te&longs;timony
were without corroborations, you would reject it
as incredible. The experience of no human being
can furni&longs;h a parallel: That I, beyond the re&longs;t of
mankind, &longs;hould be re&longs;erved for a de&longs;tiny without
alleviation, and without example! Li&longs;ten to my
narrative, and then &longs;ay what it is that has made me
de&longs;erve to be placed on this dreadful eminence, if,
indeed, every faculty be not &longs;u&longs;pended in wonder
that I am &longs;till alive, and am able to relate it.
My father's ance&longs;try was noble on the paternal
&longs;ide; but his mother was the daughter of a merchant.
My grand-father was a younger brother,
and a native of Saxony. He was placed, when he
had reached the &longs;uitable age, at a German college.
During the vacations, he employed him&longs;elf in traversing
the neighbouring territory. On one




occasion it was his fortune to vi&longs;it Hamburg. He
formed an acquaintance with Leonard Wei&longs;e, a
merchant of that city, and was a frequent gue&longs;t at
his hou&longs;e. The merchant had an only daughter,
for whom his gue&longs;t &longs;peedily contracted an affection;
and, in &longs;pite of parental menaces and prohibitions,
he, in due &longs;ea&longs;on, became her hu&longs;band.
By this act he mortally offended his relations.
Thenceforward he was entirely di&longs;owned and rejected
by them. They refu&longs;ed to contribute any
thing to his &longs;upport. All intercour&longs;e cea&longs;ed, and
he received from them merely that treatment to
which an ab&longs;olute &longs;tranger, or dete&longs;ted enemy,
would be entitled.
He found an a&longs;ylum in the hou&longs;e of his new father,
who&longs;e temper was kind, and who&longs;e pride
was flattered by this alliance. The nobility of his
birth was put in the balance again&longs;t his poverty.
Wei&longs;e conceived him&longs;elf, on the whole, to have
acted with the highe&longs;t di&longs;cretion, in thus di&longs;po&longs;ing
of his child. My grand-father found it incumbent
on him to &longs;earch out &longs;ome mode of independent
&longs;ub&longs;i&longs;tence. His youth had been eagerly devoted
to literature and mu&longs;ic. The&longs;e had hitherto been
cultivated merely as &longs;ources of amu&longs;ement. They
were now converted into the means of gain. At
this period there were few works of ta&longs;te in the
Saxon dialect. My ance&longs;tor may be con&longs;idered as
the &longs;ounder of the German Theatre. The modern
poet of the &longs;ame name is &longs;prung from the &longs;ame family,
and, perhaps, &longs;urpa&longs;&longs;es but little, in the fruitfulness
of his invention, or the &longs;oundne&longs;s of his
ta&longs;te, the elder Wieland. His life was &longs;pent in the
compo&longs;ition of &longs;onatas and dramatic pieces. They
were not unpopular, but merely afforded him a
&longs;canty &longs;ub&longs;i&longs;tence. He died in the bloom of his life,




and was quickly followed to the grave by his wife.
Their only child was taken under the protection of
the merchant. At an early age he was apprenticed
to a London trader, and pa&longs;&longs;ed &longs;even years of mercantile
&longs;ervitude.
My father was not fortunate in the character of
him under who&longs;e care he was now placed. He was
treated with rigor, and full employment was provided
for every hour of his time. His duties were
laborious and mechanical. He had been educated
with a view to this profe&longs;&longs;ion, and, therefore, was
not tormented with un&longs;atisfied de&longs;ires. He did not
hold his pre&longs;ent occupations in abhorrence, becau&longs;e
they withheld him from paths more flowery and
more &longs;mooth, but he found in unintermitted labour,
and in the &longs;ternne&longs;s of his ma&longs;ter, &longs;ufficient occasions
for di&longs;content. No opportunities of recreation
were allowed him. He &longs;pent all his time pent
up in a gloomy apartment, or traver&longs;ing narrow
and crowded &longs;treets. His food was coar&longs;e, and
his lodging humble.
His heart gradually contracted a habit of moro&longs;e
and gloomy reflection. He could not accurately
define what was wanting to his happine&longs;s. He was
not tortured by compari&longs;ons drawn between his own
&longs;ituation and that of others. His &longs;tate was &longs;uch as
&longs;uited his age and his views as to fortune. He did
not imagine him&longs;elf treated with extraordinary or
unju&longs;tifiable rigor. In this re&longs;pect he &longs;uppo&longs;ed the
condition of others, bound like him&longs;elf to mercantile
&longs;ervice, to re&longs;emble his own; yet every engagement
was irk&longs;ome, and every hour tedious in
its lap&longs;e.
In this &longs;tate of mind he chanced to light upon a
book written by one of the teachers of the Albigenses,
or French Prote&longs;tants. He entertained no





reli&longs;h for books, and was wholly uncon&longs;cious of
any power they po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;ed to delight or in&longs;truct.
This volume had lain for years in a corner of his
garret, half buried in du&longs;t and rubbi&longs;h. He had
marked it as it lay; had thrown it, as his occa&longs;ions
required, from one &longs;pot to another; but had felt no
inclination to examine its contents, or even to inquire
what was the &longs;ubject of which it treated.
One Sunday afternoon, being induced to retire
for a few minutes to his garret, his eye was attracted
by a page of this book, which, by &longs;ome accident,
had been opened and placed full in his view.
He was &longs;eated on the edge of his bed, and was employed
in repairing a rent in &longs;ome part of his clothes.
His eyes were not confined to his work, but occasionally
wandering, lighted at length upon the page.
The words “Seek and ye &longs;hall find,” were tho&longs;e
that fir&longs;t offered them&longs;elves to his notice. His curiosity
was rou&longs;ed by the&longs;e &longs;o far as to prompt him
to proceed. As &longs;oon as he fini&longs;hed his work, he
took up the book and turned to the fir&longs;t page. The
further he read, the more inducement he found to
continue, and he regretted the decline of the light
which obliged him for the pre&longs;ent to clo&longs;e it.
The book contained an expo&longs;ition of the doctrine
of the &longs;ect of Cami&longs;&longs;ards, and an hi&longs;torical
account of its origin. His mind was in a &longs;tate peculiarly
fitted for the reception of devotional sentiments.
The craving which had haunted him was
now &longs;upplied with an object. His mind was at no
lo&longs;s for a theme of meditation. On days of business,
he ro&longs;e at the dawn, and retired to his chamber
not till late at night. He now &longs;upplied him&longs;elf
with candles, and employed his nocturnal and Sunday
hours in &longs;tudying this book. It, of cour&longs;e,
abounded with allu&longs;ions to the Bible. All its




conclusions were deduced from the &longs;acred text. This
was the fountain, beyond which it was unnece&longs;&longs;ary
to trace the &longs;tream of religious truth; but it was
his duty to trace it thus far.
A Bible was ea&longs;ily procured, and he ardently
entered on the &longs;tudy of it. His under&longs;tanding had
received a particular direction. All his reveries
were fa&longs;hioned in the &longs;ame mould. His progre&longs;s
towards the formation of his creed was rapid.
Every fact and &longs;entiment in this book were viewed
through a medium which the writings of the Camissard
apo&longs;tle had &longs;ugge&longs;ted. His con&longs;tructions
of the text were ha&longs;ty, and formed on a narrow
&longs;cale. Every thing was viewed in a di&longs;connected
po&longs;ition. One action and one precept were not
employed to illu&longs;trate and re&longs;trict the meaning of
another. Hence aro&longs;e a thou&longs;and &longs;cruples to which
he had hitherto been a &longs;tranger. He was alternately
agirated by fear and by ec&longs;tacy. He imagined
him&longs;elf be&longs;et by the &longs;nares of a &longs;piritual foe,
and that his &longs;ecurity lay in cea&longs;ele&longs;s watchfulne&longs;s
and prayer.
Hís morals, which had never been loo&longs;e, were now
modelled by a &longs;tricter &longs;tandard. The empire of
religious duty extended it&longs;elf to his looks, ge&longs;tures,
and phra&longs;es. All levities of &longs;peech, and negligences
of behaviour, were pro&longs;cribed. His air was mournful
and contemplative. He laboured to keep alive
a &longs;entiment of fear, and a belief of the awe-creating
pre&longs;ence of the Deity. Ideas foreign to this were
&longs;edulou&longs;ly excluded. To &longs;uffer their intru&longs;ion was
a crime again&longs;t the Divine Maje&longs;ty inexpiable but
by days and weeks of the keene&longs;t agonies.
No material variation had occurred in the lap&longs;e
of two years. Every day confirmed him in his
pre&longs;ent modes of thinking and acting. It was to




be expected that the tide of his emotions would
&longs;ometimes recede, that intervals of de&longs;pondency and
doubt would occur; but the&longs;e gradually were more
rare, and of &longs;horter duration; and he, at la&longs;t, arrived
at a &longs;tate con&longs;iderably uniform in this re&longs;ect.
His apprentice&longs;hip was now almo&longs;t expired. On
his arrival of age he became entitled, by the will
of my grand-father, to a &longs;mall &longs;um. This &longs;um
would hardly &longs;uffice to &longs;et him afloat as a trader in
his pre&longs;ent &longs;ituation, and he had nothing to expect
from the genero&longs;ity of his ma&longs;ter. Re&longs;idence in
England had, be&longs;ides, become almo&longs;t impo&longs;&longs;ible,
on account of his religious tenets. In addition to
the&longs;e motives for &longs;eeking a new habitation, there
was another of the mo&longs;t imperious and irre&longs;i&longs;table
nece&longs;&longs;ity. He had imbibed an opinion that it was
his duty to di&longs;&longs;eminate the truths of the go&longs;pel among
the unbelieving nations. He was terrified at fir&longs;t
by the perils and hard&longs;hips to which the life of a
mi&longs;&longs;onary is expo&longs;ed. This cowardice made him
diligent in the invention of objections and excu&longs;es;
but he found it impo&longs;&longs;ible wholly to &longs;hake off the
belief that &longs;uch was the injunction of his duty.
The belief, after every new conflict with his passions,
acquired new &longs;trength; and, at length, he
formed a re&longs;olution of complying with what he
deemed the will of heaven.
The North-American Indians naturally pre&longs;ented
them&longs;elves as the fir&longs;t objects for this &longs;pecies of benevolence.
As &longs;oon as his &longs;ervitude expired, he
converted his little fortune into money, and embarked
for Philadelphia. Here his fears were revived,
and a nearer &longs;urvey of &longs;avage manners once
more &longs;hook his re&longs;olution. For a while he relinquished
his purpo&longs;e, and purcha&longs;ing a farm on
Sehuylkill, within a few miles of the city, &longs;et




himself down to the cultivation of it. The cheapne&longs;s
of land, and the &longs;ervice of African &longs;laves, which
were then in general u&longs;e, gave him who was poor
in Europe all the advantages of wealth. He pa&longs;&longs;ed
fourteen years in a thrifty and laborious manner.
In this time new objects, new employments, and
new a&longs;&longs;ociates appeared to have nearly obliterated
the devout impre&longs;&longs;ions of his youth. He now became
acquainted with a woman of a meek and
quiet di&longs;po&longs;ition, and of &longs;lender acquirements like
him&longs;elf. He proffered his hand and was accepted.
His previous indu&longs;try had now enabled him to
di&longs;pen&longs;e with per&longs;onal labour, and direct attention
to his own concerns. He enjoyed lei&longs;ure, and was
vi&longs;ited afre&longs;h by devotional contemplation. The
reading of the &longs;criptures, and other religious books,
became once more his favorite employment. His
ancient belief relative to the conver&longs;ion of the savage
tribes, was revived with uncommon energy.
To the former ob&longs;tacles were now added the pleadings
of parental and conjugal love. The &longs;truggle
was long and vehement; but his &longs;en&longs;e of duty would
not be &longs;tifled or enfeebled, and finally triumphed
over every impediment.
His efforts were attended with no permanent success.
His exhortations had &longs;ometimes a temporary
power, but more frequently were repelled with insult
and deri&longs;ion. In pur&longs;uit of this object he encountered
the mo&longs;t imminent perils, and underwent
incredible fatigues, hunger, &longs;ickne&longs;s, and &longs;olitude.
The licence of &longs;avage pa&longs;&longs;ion, and the artifices of
his depraved countrymen, all oppo&longs;ed them&longs;elves
to his progre&longs;s. His courage did not for&longs;ake him
till there appeared no rea&longs;onable ground to hope
for &longs;ucce&longs;s. He de&longs;i&longs;ted not till his heart was relieved
from the &longs;uppo&longs;ed obligation to per&longs;evere.




With a con&longs;titution &longs;omewhat decayed, he at length
returned to his family. An interval of tranquillity
&longs;ucceeded. He was &longs;rugal, regular, and &longs;trict in
the performance of dome&longs;tic duties. He allied himself
with no &longs;ect, becau&longs;e he perfectly agreed with
none. Social wor&longs;hip is that by which they are
all di&longs;tingui&longs;hed; but this article found no place in
his creed. He rigidly interpreted that precept which
enjoins us, when we wor&longs;hip, to retire into solitude,
and &longs;hut out every &longs;pecies of &longs;ociety. According
to him devotion was not only a &longs;ilent office,
but mu&longs;t be performed alone. An hour at noon,
and an hour at midnight were thus appropriated.
At the di&longs;tance of three hundred yards from his
hou&longs;e, on the top of a rock who&longs;e &longs;ides were &longs;teep,
rugged, and encumbered with dwarf cedars and
&longs;tony a&longs;perities, he built what to a common eye
would have &longs;eemed a &longs;ummer-hou&longs;e. The ea&longs;tern
verge of this precipice was &longs;ixty feet above the tiver
which flowed at its foot. The view before it
con&longs;i&longs;ted of a tran&longs;parent current, fluctuating and
rippling in a rocky channel, and bounded by a rising
&longs;cene of cornfields and orchards. The edifice
was &longs;light and airy. It was no more than a circular
area, twelve feet in diameter, who&longs;e flooring
was the rock, cleared of mo&longs;s and &longs;hrubs, and exactly
levelled, edged by twelve Tu&longs;can columns,
and covered by an undulating dome. My father
furni&longs;hed the dimen&longs;ions and outlines, but allowed
the arti&longs;t whom he employed to complete the structure
on his own plan. It was without &longs;eat, table,
or ornament of any kind.
This was the temple of his Deity. Twice in
twenty-four hours he repaired hither, unaccompanied
by any human being. Nothing but phy&longs;ical
inability to move was allowed to ab&longs;truct or




postpone this vi&longs;it. He did not exact from his family
compliance with his example. Few men, equally
&longs;incere in their faith, were as &longs;paring in their censures
and re&longs;trictions, with re&longs;pect to the conduct
of others, as my father. The character of my
mother was no le&longs;s devout; but her education had
habituated her to a different mode of wor&longs;hip.
The loneline&longs;s of their dwelling prevented her from
joining any e&longs;tabli&longs;hed congregation; but &longs;he was
punctual in the offices of prayer, and in the performance
of hymns to her Saviour, after the manner
of the di&longs;ciples of Zinzendorf. My father refused
to interfere in her arrangements. His own
&longs;y&longs;tem was embraced not, accurately &longs;peaking, because
it was the be&longs;t, but becau&longs;e it had been expreslly
pre&longs;cribed to him. Other modes, if practifed
by other per&longs;ons, might be equally acceptable.
His deportment to others was full of charity and
mildne&longs;s. A &longs;adne&longs;s perpetually over&longs;pread his features,
but was unmingled with &longs;ternne&longs;s or discontent.
The tones of his voice, his ge&longs;tures, his &longs;teps
were all in tranquil uni&longs;on. His conduct was characterised
by a certain forbearance and humility,
which &longs;ecured the e&longs;teem of tho&longs;e to whom his tenets
were mo&longs;t obnoxious. They might call him
a fanatic and a dreamer, but they could not deny
their veneration to his invincible candour and invariable
integrity. His own belief of rectitude was
the foundation of his happine&longs;s. This, however,
was de&longs;tined to find an end.
Suddenly the &longs;adne&longs;s that con&longs;tantly attended him
was deepened. Sighs, and even tears, &longs;ometimes
e&longs;caped him. To the expo&longs;tulations of his wife
he &longs;eldom an&longs;wered any thing. When he de&longs;igned
to be communicative, he hinted that his peace of
mind was flown, in con&longs;equence of deviation from




his duty. A command had been laid upon him,
which he had delayed to perform. He felt as if a
certain period of he&longs;itation and reluctance had been
allowed him, but that this period was pa&longs;&longs;ed. He
was no longer permitted to obey. The duty assigned
to him was transferred, in con&longs;equence of
his di&longs;obedience, to another, and all that remained
was to endure the penalty.
He did not de&longs;cribe this penalty. It appeared to
be nothing more for &longs;ome time than a &longs;en&longs;e of
wrong. This was &longs;ufficiently acute, and was aggravated
by the belief that his offence was incapable
of explation. No one could contemplate the
agonies which he &longs;eemed to &longs;uffer without the deepest
compa&longs;&longs;ion. Time, in&longs;tead of lightening the
burthen, appeared to add to it. At length he hinted
to his wife, that his end was near. His imagination
did not prefigure the mode or the time of his
decea&longs;e, but was fraught with an incurable persuasion
that his death was at hand. He was likewise
haunted by the belief that the kind of death
that a waited him was &longs;trange and terrible. His
anticipations were thus far vague and indefinite;
but they &longs;ufficed to poi&longs;on every moment of his being,
and devote him to cea&longs;ele&longs;s angui&longs;h.
