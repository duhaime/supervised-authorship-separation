The writing a Preface to a Book
seems to be invented for the Purpose
of introducing the Author to
the Acquaintance of the Reader; and hath
been so general a Practice, that from
Custom it appears to be established almost
as a necessary Rule; and as every well-bred
Man, when he presents Strangers to
each other, informs them who they are to
address, so doth the Author, in his Preface,
acquaint his Reader in some degree
what is the Nature of his Design; or what
he thinks so necessary to avoid, that he
is careful it shall not be found in his
Writing. 
The following Sheets are composed of
the Histories of Persons, whose Conduct 

in Life gives abundant Opportunity of dissplaying
the natural Tendency of Virtue towards
the Attainment of Happiness; and,
on the contrary, that Misery is the unavoidable
Consequence of vicious Life; and tho'
it is hoped the Characters are really to be
found in human Nature, otherwise they
would indeed deserve no other Appellation
than Chimeras, yet are they universal,
and not pointed at Individuals. 
It is amazing with what Celerity Conjectures
are formed, by which the Incidents
that befal, or the Behaviour of, the Personages
in these kinds of Histories of
Life and Manners, are dragged by the
most far-fetched Deductions to mean a
Reflexion on Mr. &wblank; or Mrs. &wblank;,
somebody whom they know; and this
often when there is less Resemblance
than in Fluellin's Parallel between Henry the
Fifth and Alexander; that they were born
in Places which began with the same Letter; 
that there were Rivers in each Country,
and Fish in the Rivers of both, is
some Degree beyond what these judicious
Discoverers can boast; who have often
no other Foundation for their Comparison,
than that the Two Persons, being 

both of the human Species, have each the
Features in common to their Kind. But
as it is requisite for a Writer, whenever
he compares one Object to another, or illustrates
a Thought by something else
that resembles it, that he should first acquaint
himself thoroughly with every minute
Difference, lest he should confuse, instead
of clearing his Meaning; so also it is
necessary that the Reader, who delights in
making Applications, should first be cautious
in considering whether he hath informed
himself of every Circumstance relating
to the Two Pictures which he
would represent as like each other, before
he draws the Parallel, and remember well,
that 

Man differs more from Man, than Man from Beast.
If we were but to reflect on the strange
Confusion the contrary Practice to what I
am recommending would make in our
common Converse with Mankind, we
should immediately perceive the Absurdity
of it in the most glaring Light; for
there we find it necessary, in order to know
our Friends and Acquaintance, not only to 

be acquainted with the Formation of human
Features in general, but also with the
different Modifications of those of every
Individual; otherwise the whole World
would be in one continued Perplexity,
and Mankind would never be able to distinguish
one Person from another; for
Men would run about challenging each
other for Acquaintance, only because they
had Mouths or Eyes, or any other human
Feature. Nor is this in any degree too
strong a Picture of Mens common Practice
in their Judgments of Books, where
not only a single Feature, but even Dress,
or the Colour of a Ribbon, serves to prove
a Likeness entirely to their Satisfaction. 
It is also very observable that these
Conjecturers are very generous in bestowing
on others those Characters which they
can spare without any Reluctance, as they
are by no means desirous of applying
them to themselves; but those exemplary
Pictures of human Nature, which are
drawn as proper to shew forth what ought
to be imitated, are very uncommonly given
away, every one appearing to have some
convenient Situation in which they can
place it at home: But this is done in Silence; 

for tho' they wish others to perceive
what is very visible to their own
Eyes; namely, that they themselves have
sat for such Pictures; yet they think it
would be a small Breach of Modesty to
declare their Thought on that head; but
a Compliment of that kind is received
with the same sort of Backwardness to acknowledge
its Justice, as a young Lady
often shews towards the Flattery of her
Admirer, when it is impossible for his
Praise to out-run her own fixed Opinion
of herself. 
The Uniformity of Character is allowed
to be one of the principal, and most
necessary Ingredients to this kind of Writing. 
The great Master, and the deepest Penetrator
into the inmost Recesses of human
Nature, in the Instructions which he
with such great Propriety and Judgment
introduces from the Mouth of Hamlet to
the Players, may, if the Writer pleases, be
most Part of it adopted also by him for his
own Advantage. Hamlet, amongst many
others, gives the following Instructions to
the Players: 

“With this special Observance, that
you o'er-step not the Modesty of Nature; 
for any thing so overdone is
from the Purpose of playing; whose
End, both at the first and now, was and
is to hold, as it were, the Mirror to
Nature; to shew Virtue her own Feature,
Scorn*  her own Image, and the
very Age and Body of the Time his
Form and Pressure. Now this overdone,
or come tardy of, tho' it make the Unskilful
laugh, cannot but make the Judicious
grieve.” 
If the Word Writing was substituted
instead of Playing, the Speech in general
would be full as applicable to the Author
as the Player; and when the former deviates
from the Paths of Nature, in either
stopping short of her Mark, or wildly running
beyond the Limits she prescribes, it
is natural for the Reader, as well as for
the Spectator at the Theatre, to join with
Hamlet in his Observation, that 

“Some of Nature's Journeymen have
made Men, and not made them well; 
they imitate Humanity so abominably.” 
It is necessary also that the Writers of
Characters, as well as the Actors who personate
them on the Theatre, should, as is
expressed finely in the same Author,
“Speak no more than is set down for
them;” for, as the Actor must be
faithful to the Words he finds in his Author,
so also must the Writer be careful
neither to diminish nor exceed in the characteristical
Strokes which are drawn by
Nature herself: And such as are peculiarly
distinguished by the Name of Characters of
Humour, should no more be distorted by
any fantastic Whim of the Poet's Brain,
than any other Character whatever; tho' a
greater Latitude seems necessary to be
given in them than in others of a more
serious Cast. The Word Humour itself
is understood so variously by very ingenious
Men, that it appears difficult to fix to
it a certain Idea. 
Ben Johnson, in Every Man out of his
Humour, hath led the Way into a little 

Path, by which perhaps it may in some
measure be traced; for, after an Enquiry
into the Nature of Humour in the Abstract,
he says 

—And hence we do conclude,
That whatsoe'er hath Fluxure and Humidity,
As wanting Power to contain itself,
Is Humour. So in every human Body,
The Choler, Melancholy, Phlegm, and Blood,
By reason that they flow continually
In some one Part; and are not continent,
Receive the Name of Humour. Now thus far
It may, by Metaphor, apply itself
Unto the general Disposition:
As when some one peculiar Quality
Doth so possess a Man, that it doth draw
All his Affects, his Spirits, and his Powers,
In their Confluxions, all to run one Way,
This may be truly said to be a Humour.
If this be true, and is by any means a proper
Explanation of the Word, what we
call Humour in an Author is the Capacity
of penetrating that peculiar Quality,
which hath taken such strong Possession
of the Character he would represent to his
Reader, that it in a great Degree flows 

through every Action of his Life, and
even influences him in the Workings of
all his Passions. 
The Combination of Circumstances,
which is necessary to display characteristic
Humours, and set them a flowing into
their proper Chanel, is at the Option
of the Author; and when these Circumstances
are judiciously chosen, the Fact
will appear to the Reader not only as a
Probability, but also will carry with it an
Air of real Truth. 
To illustrate this by an Instance: If an
Author hath an Inclination to display the
Characteristic of various Persons under
the Influence of the Passion of Fear, and
should therefore contrive to place them
all together in a House on Fire (which is
very adequate to the raising the greatest
Consternation); the Fire must not walk
to the House, and burn it, “will he, nill
he,” as the Clown says; but natural Circumstances
must combine for that Purpose: 
And even in such a Calamity, when
the Bent of the Disposition is strong, it
will not fail to display itself. 

The Miser, even if he had before been
confined to his Bed with the Gout or Stone,
will break through all Obstacles to preserve
his darling Treasure from Danger. 
The enamoured Swain will fly as if he had
borrowed Wings, to bear his Fair-one,
as Æneas did Anchises his Father, safe
from the Terrors of devouring Flames. 
Friends will fly to Friends Apartments to
secure the Joy of their affectionate Hearts. 
The fond Parents, forgetful of their own
own Danger, will bear in their Remembrance
no other Part of the House than
that wherein their little innocent darling
Treasure is deposited. 
The fine Lady, who has an Antipathy
to half God's Creation, who screams at
the Sight of a Mouse, faints at a Spider,
and breaks the Rest of her Family with a
Thousand needless Apprehensions, would
here indeed be somewhat out of her usual
Conceit, and shew the Effect of true
Fear, by being too much frighted to make
a clamorous Noise; but yet I am much
mistaken, if her beloved Affectation would
not break forth, before such a Scene was
concluded; and in all Probability her apparent
Fears would greatly increase, as her 

Apprehensions and the real Danger lessened,
and her vociferous Screams would
break most abundantly forth, when indeed
there was no need of any such Matter. 
But if, on the contrary, it was to be related
of the Miser, that, forgetting his
Money, his whole Care was placed on the
Safety of the Lady; of the Lover, that, neglecting
his Mistress, his Attention was
all employed on any other Treasure, but
her; or that the Parent abandoned all
Thoughts of his Offspring; the Whole
would be perplexed, and Nature would
be intirely banished from such an absurd
Representation. But here it may be observed,
that as the Writer must be
thoroughly acquainted with the Bent of
the Dispositions of the Miser, the Lover,
the Friend, and the Parent, before he can
make any of them act with Propriety on
this or any other Occasion, so must the
Reader also have some Degree of Knowlege
of them before he can judge truly
whether they are represented right or
wrong, or distinguish what is natural from
the wild Fancies of the Poet's Brain. 
Characters, which are drawn up by
Historians, are often perplexed and confused 

by Party Spirit; Prejudice or Partiality
too often swaying the Authors, either
to lash them with unreasonable Satire,
or to smooth them over with a kind of glittering
Varnish, so that it is as difficult to
trace the real Features of the Man, who is
transmitted to Posterity in a Figure perfectly
different from what he really bore in
his Life-time, as it would be to discover a
Roman Senator dressed like a modern fine
Gentleman. 
Amongst all the Biographers, whose
Characters were taken from real Life,
none seem to have in so very intelligible a
Manner acquainted their Readers with the
true Characteristic of their Heroes, as Plutarch; 
in Admiration of whom Montaigne
expresses himself so warmly, that he acknowleges
his Obligation to the French
Translator of him in this very remarkable
Expression: “He hath,” says he, “lifted
us Dunces out of the Dust;” as if understanding
Plutarch was of itself enough
to give a Man a Claim to Knowlege, and
to baffle the dark Clouds of Ignorance. 
The short and pointed Story of Alexander
the Great's enquiring of the Philosopher, 

“What a Man must do to become
a God?” throws more Light on the inward
Recess of the proud Hero's Mind,
than if Plutarch had blazoned forth his
own Parts by all the most pompous Descriptions
of Alexander's Conquests; for as
the little, almost imperceptible, Wheels
generally influence the greatest worldly
Machines, in like manner do the smallest
Incidents most clearly unravel the intricate
Labyrinths of the human Mind; and
this Story, as it is the strongest Proof of
his unbounded Ambition, is also a sort of
Key to every Action which is recorded of
his Life. 
The Perspicuity and Propriety of the
Moral is allowed to be another Ingredient
absolutely necessary to this, and indeed to
all kinds of Writings of Invention. 
Bossu declares it to be the Opinion of
both Aristotle and Horace, That Poets teach
moral Philosophy; and that the latter
even gives the Preference in this respect
to Homer over the Philosophers themselves. 

Then Bossu assigns the Cause why the
Poets thus excel simple Philosophers, and
says, that it arises from the Nature of the
Poetry, which in every kind is wholly
an Imitation; now Imitation, continues
he, is extremely agreeable and natural to
Man; for which Reason this Manner of
treating any Subject is much more engageing,
and more properly adapted to gain
Attention. Besides Imitation gives Instruction
by the Force of Examples; and
Examples are so much the more powerful
to persuade, as they prove the Possibility
of following them; to all which Bossu also
adds, that Imitation is so much of the
intrinsic Nature of Poetry, that Aristotle
declares the Art itself to that Cause owes
its Birth. 
Thus it is visibly the unanimous Opinion
of those great Men, that Poets are,
as it were, the Imitators, I had almost said
the Mimicks, of Nature; an Appellation
which, in its present Use, carries with it
indeed very little Dignity, and seems to
imply only a Capacity at catching at some
Peculiarity of Gesture or Behaviour,
in order to point out an Object of Derision. 
But the Poets were considered as 

Imitators of Nature in a very different
Light from that narrow and confined
Sense; as Searchers into the inmost Labyrinths
of the human Mind; as penetrating
the Force of the different characteristic
Bent of the various Dispositions of
Men towards their Conduct in Life, and
then placing them in such Circumstances,
as give an ample Field to display, by the
Examples they bring into Action, the
fatal Effects of indulged Passions, and
the happy Result of restraining all Passions
and Tumults of the human Breast within
the proper Limits prescribed by Reason; 
for Monsieur Rochefocault truly says, “It
is difficult to conquer the Passions, but
it is impossible to satisfy them;” that is,
when they rebel against their proper
Guide, and forcibly snatch the Reins out
of the Hands of that Governor appointed
to restrain and keep them within their own
prescribed Bounds. Every Vice, by which
a bad Man is actuated, as well as every
Virtue which animates the Bosom of a
good Character, tends, if properly managed,
to produce the Moral, which is
essentially necessary to render any Writing
useful to the Reader. 

The narrow-minded and illiberal Peruser
of Books, who searches only for
pointed Satire, and can relish no Character,
but such as he finds, or imagines he
finds, to partake of the Nature of an abusive
Libel on some particular Person, is
incapable of being pleased with general
Pictures of Nature; but, like the Palate
vitiated by habitual Luxury, he requires
sharp and seasoned Sauce before he can
relish any Food whatsoever; and it is
more Matter of Triumph to such Readers
to find out a Similitude in any Individual
of their Acquaintance to some ridiculous
Story, or bad Character, than if they could
discover all the Verisimilitudes that were
ever thought of. 
Perhaps a Beau or a Belle, who run thro'
Writings for this Purpose, would at the
same time look down, with supercilious
Contempt, on the Seaman who read Virgil
with no other View but to observe whether
or no he understood Geography; and
as soon as he discovered that he was not
ignorant in the only Point in which he
himself could claim any Knowlege, he admitted
Virgil to be a very fine Writer; 
and yet the same Belle or Beau might be 

told, with great Truth, that their own
Manner of dealing with Books is much
more confined and illiberal than the Seaman's,
and an undoubted Proof of a smaller
Degree of Understanding than that
which belonged to the honest Tar, added
to that Failure of Candour and Benignity
of Heart, which is a much greater Blemish
in their Nature, than the highest Degree of
mere Ignorance and Want of Taste can
ever deserve to be accused of. 
If an Author happens to live in an Age
when a general Fashion of Dissipation
banishes Reflexion, and the View in Reading
at all is circumscribed within such
narrow Limits, that the Pleasure thereby
proposed seems to be no other than to
discover some Reference to particular Objects,
and universal Resemblances to human
Nature are overlooked, he ought to
content himself without such Applause as
is only to be obtained by the Forfeiture
of his own moral Character; and would
make a very injudicious Bargain, if he so
far adapted his Practice to their Taste,
that he must necessarily be conscious of
being a bad Man, in order to be accounted
by such Readers a pleasing Writer. Well 

said Horace, when he prefers any thing to
this Manner of Writing: 

Better even this, than cruelly defame,
And point Buffoons and Villains out by Name:
Sure to be hated, even by those you spare,
Whose Anger's always equal to their Fear.
And more commendable yet is the same
good-humoured Roman Bard in his Declaration,
that 

No honest Man shall by my Satire bleed* .
There is a peculiar Care necessary concerning
the Purity of Language; I do not
here mean any thing which is called Elegance
or Beauty of Style; but only that
the Terms, which are ever applied to
whatsoever is deservedly laudable, should
on no account be used so equivocally, as to
be made applicable indifferently to what is
either vicious or virtuous. 
I cannot forbear translating a Passage
from Bossu, which is so exactly adapted to
the present Purpose, that it is perfectly expressive 

of the Ideas I would wish on this
Occasion to convey to the Reader. 
“*  The Poet hath also this in common
with Orators and Philosophers, that he
ought, like them, to appear a wise, prudent,
and virtuous Man; for this Reason,
and more especially because he ought
to teach Virtue, he is obliged to be
perfectly acquainted with Morality, and
to be truly virtuous. This Science
consists in Practice; it is not learned
by simple Speculations only. If a good
and solid Morality doth not correct our
Passions, it is almost impossible but that
our Passions will lead us into a false
Morality. We do not blame, with a
good Grace, the Faults in which we 

delight: We love better to believe that
they are not Vices, than to acknowlege
to ourselves that we are vicious. 
“If Horace judged rightly, in saying
that Homer would have praised Wine
less, if he had not loved it; what can be
thought of those who dwell with so
much Pleasure and Affectation on whatsoever
is most shameful and criminal in
our Passions? who from thence form
the most interesting and pathetic Parts
of their Poems; and who represent infamous
Amours under the Appellation
of Gallantries, which an honest Man,
and a real fine Gentleman, can place
among the Number of his fortunate
Adventures? 

“To represent Vice only under soft
and amiable Colours, is not the Method
to make it hated. Those who set
them forth under beautiful Masques,
give sufficient Cause to believe that they
view them only in that Light, and that
their Lives are consonant to their Morality
and their Writings. 
“If there are Readers who have the
same Taste, it is not to them that an
Author ought to accommodate himself; 
for this would be to corrupt the most
essential Rules of Poetry and Fable. A
pernicious Art is not an Art, or at least
ought not to be tolerated. If there are
no other Readers, and a Poet is obliged 

to be corrupt, in order to please, it is
unfortunate for those who cherish this
Corruption; and who prefer the Glory
of being a Poet to that of being a good
Man. 
“These Reflexions are not foreign to my
Subject, because they serve to illustrate
what is the Conduct of Homer and
Virgil. These Heathens have not sullied
the Majesty of their epic Poems by
criminal Delicacies. Ulysses is cold towards
Circe; melancholy when with
Calypso: Briseis and Chryseis inflame
Achilles and Agamemnon with Anger
only; Camilla hath no Lovers; the
Love of Turnus for Lavinia is scarcely 

mentioned; and the whole Passion of
Dido is treated as a criminal Infidelity,
for which that wretched Queen is cruelly
punished.” 
The Moral should most clearly manifest
what seems to be evidently the Fact, That the
Mind, under the Influence of any indulged
vicious Passion, is of itself and essentially
unhappy, even without the Consideration
of any Consequences, as truly as the Body
is unhealthy whilst it labours under any
Distemper whatsoever; for Virtue is as
certainly the Strength of the Mind, as
Health is visibly the Cause of the Vigour
of the Body; and the Soul is as much diseased
by Vice, as the Body is by a Fever. 
The various Manner in which the greatest
Geniuses have personified almost all the
different evil Passions by which the Mind
of Man is ever actuated, whether in the
Forms of Furies, or in any other Shape,
with all the proper Circumstances with
which they have surrounded such Personages; 

giving them Power to inflict the
Stings of Serpents, the Venom of Snakes,
with all that is dreadful to human Nature; 
plainly prove, that those elevated and uncommon
Capacities meant to display, under
such allegorical Descriptions, the immediate
Misery which accompanies the
cherishing such evil Passions; and it would
be dealing very unjustly by such Writers,
to suppose that they had no other View
therein, than to give a Loose to their enlarged
Imaginations: For if such was indeed
the Fact, it would greatly lessen the
Absurdity of that trite Saying, that “Wit
and Judgment never go together.” 
The Story of Amata, in Virgil's Seventh
Book of the Æneid, affords abundant Proof
of that Poet's Judgment, in joining this
Moral to the luxuriant Flights of the
Imagination. 
When Juno resolves to carry her Point,
and gratify her inexorable Revenge against
the Trojans, agreeable to this noble Determination,
she says, 

What tho' the partial Heav'ns my Aims repel,
I'll raise new Forces from the Depths of Hell!

And then she immediately calls the Fury
best fitted for the destined Purpose from
her infernal Habitation, and Alecto comes
forth thus beautifully described: 

Crimes, Frauds, and Murders, are the Fiend's Delight,
The Rage of Death, and Slaughters of the Fight.
So fierce her Looks! such Terrors from her Eyes!
Round her grim Front such monstrous Serpents rise!
She scares ev'n Pluto, her immortal Sire;
Her Sister Furies tremble, and retire.
Thus, armed with Serpents, is Rage
properly personified; because into whatsoever
Bosom Rage ever gets Admittance,
mental Pain, such as resembles that which
follows on the Sting of Serpents in the
Body, certainly accompanies her; and
when the Fury arrives at Amata's Door,
how finely she insinuates herself, while she
keeps concealed from the Queen's Sight; 
for the View of her was sure to make her
avoided: 

Here stopt the Fiend; and (Discord all her View)
Snatch'd from her hissing Locks, a Snake she threw.
And thro' her inmost Soul the Fury flew.

Unfelt, the Monster glides thro' every Vest,
And breathes the secret Poison in her Breast.
Now, like a Fillet, round her Temples roll'd;
Now, round her bosom, like a Chain of Gold,
Now to her Tresses he repairs, and there
Thrids every Kinglet of her golden Hair.
If this Description was to be considered
very particularly, every Instance of the
Manner in which the Monster glides, might
perhaps be visibly full of Meaning. We
now almost see the Fury at work: 

Thus while her kindling Soul the Pest inspires
With the first Sparkles of her fatal Fires.
And Virgil leaves her to complete her Design,
whilst he declares what Amata was
before her Arrival; but there seems to be
an inimitable Beauty in the Description of
Amata before she was thus envenomed; 
when, tho' disappointed in her Desire of
marrying her Daughter Lavinia to Turnus,
by her Husband's Determination to give
her to Æneas, yet she was afflicted without
being irritated, and only complained
in such a Manner as became a Matron: 


Before the Bosom of the Royal Dame
Felt the full Furies of th' infernal Flame,
She speaks her Grief, in Accents soft and mild,
Implores the Sire, and sorrows o'er her Child.
And must Lavinia then, our only Joy,
Wed with this wand'ring Fugitive of Troy?
And can a Father issue the Decree,
So fatal to himself, to her, and me?
But while the Fury is working in her
Mind, we see her rise by degrees in her
Language; and the first visible Instance
we perceive of her Change, is in her reproaching
the old King her Husband: 

Where, where is Friendship, Truth, and Honour, now?
A Father's promise, and a Monarch's Vow!
But when the Fury hath thoroughly insinuated
the Venom through her whole
Mind, then we see her come forth in all
the Height of Misery: 

But now the spreading Poison fir'd her Whole,
Ev'n to the last Recesses of her Soul.
In her wild Thoughts a thousand Horrors rise,
And fierce and madding round the Streets she flies.

So the gay Striplings lash, in eager Sport,
A Top, in giddy Circles, round a Court:
In rapid Rings it whirls, and spins aloud,
Admir'd with Rapture by the blooming Croud;
From ev'ry Stroke flies humming o'er the Ground,
And gains new Spirit as the Blow goes round.
Perhaps there cannot be a stronger or finer
Contrast described than this, between the
harmless Effects, and the very supportable
Affliction, of mild Sorrow, when placed
in the Comparison with the dreadful Consequences,
as well as the insupportable
Pain, of furious Rage. But here Virgil
takes great Care to paint in the most
glaring Colours the Misery that Amata
suffered from the Moment she had admitted
this furious Passion, even whilst
she was yet ignorant of all the future
Misfortunes that might happen from it; 
for nothing can give us so strong an Idea
of the Misery of a Woman, as to suppose
her under the Power of her own Passions,
in such a manner as to bear a Resemblance
to the Top, which is whipped about at
the Will and Pleasure of the Boys. And
every human Creatre, under the Lash of
their own furious Passions, doth bear a
very strong Resemblance to the Top so 

whirled about, except in one very disadvantageous
Circumstance on the Side of
Mankind, that of feeling the Strokes,
whilst they perturb and rend from the Bosom
every peaceful Thought, and every
Possibility of enjoying one Moment's Pleasure. 
Perhaps, by reflecting on every Circumstance
which attends this Action of the
whirling the Top about by the Strokes
given by the Children, we should find
there is no Simile more adapted to illustrate
the inward Perturbation of the
human Mind under the Influence of unrestrained
Passion; which might be Virgil's
Reason for admitting into his Poem
a Simile, which, on a cursory View, and
without these Considerations, appears of
too little Importance to be worth his peculiar
Notice. 
There is no Person, who reads this Story
with any Attention, but what must conclude
the Sufferings of Amata, whilst she
was only sorrowfully complaining, and
gently remonstrating against her Husband's
Determination, were very trifling in comparison
of what she endured when her whole 

Soul was inflamed with Fury, and she was
raging through the Streets: Yet Virgil does
not stop even there; but completes the
whole by displaying the last Effects of
such Fury, by working Amata up to that
Height of Madness which results naturally
from such a Beginning. 

Thus flew the giddy Queen, with Fury stung,
Thro' the wide Town, amid the wond'ring Throng
Yet more—the destin'd Nuptials to delay,
Fierce to the darksome Wood she bounds away;
And, rising still in Rage, with Rites divine,
She feign'd new Orgies to the God of Wine.
Thou, Bacchus, only thou, deserv'st the Fair!
For thee, in Ringlets grows her lovely Hair!
For thee, she leads the Dance, and wreathes her Ivy-Spear!
And thus the fond Mother, who at first
seemed to have placed all her future Hopes
of Happiness, all her Prospect of Comfort
in her old Age, on one only Child, is actuated
by Rage, and the Virulence of Passion,
to such a Height of Madness, as, rather
than see her Husband's Determination
take place, voluntarily to devote this
Daughter, this Darling of her Heart, to
Bacchus. 

This Story of Amata is surrounded with
every Circumstance that can possibly raise
our Aversion to Rage and Virulence; and
more particularly when it irritates and inflames
the female Bosom, and eradicates
thence that Gentleness which is the characteristic
Beauty of the female Mind. 
To the judicious Reader the Moral of
this Story is very conspicuous; tho' the
Manner of Virgil's Writing, and the
Dignity of Epic Poetry, might require
Allegories, and that his Stories should be
surrounded with such Incidents as were
necessary to his whole Purpose. But when
we stop at those outward Circumstances,
and perceive not the farther Intention, we
read as Children see Tragedies, who place
their chief Delight in the Noise of the
Kettle drums and Trumpets; or as the
Multitude in Holiday-time throng to see
Shakespeare's Play of Harry the Eighth,
and attend only to the Show of the Coronation,
passing over all the beautiful Strokes
therein contained, as little worthy of their
Notice. 
I have somewhere read an Observation,
I believe it is in La Bruyero, to this Effect, 

That many Persons have endeavoured to
teach Men to write; but none have taught,
them to read; as if Reading consisted only
in distinguishing the Letters and Words
from each other. 
A manuscript Essay on this Subject,
which was found in the Study of an old
Gentleman, who was well known by his
Acquaintance to have been a curious Observer
of Nature, may not perhaps be unentertaining
to the Reader. 
“A curious Eye might perhaps as justly
trace Mens different Dispositions, from
the Delight they place in, or the Observations
they make on, the various Parts
of the Writings of Imagination, as in
observing them in any other Situation
whatever. And I never went into any
Man's Library, but, by casting an Eye
on those kind of Books, I could employ
my Fancy with forming Conjectures
on the Man's Bent of Disposition,
by seeing what Characters, and what
Parts of such Writings, shewed visible
Marks of having been oftenest opened; 
and I have really found, on farther Acquaintance, 

that these Conjectures were
built on a good Foundation. 
“The Hero's Homer or Virgil will certainly
shew the Marks of being most
used, where all the Thunder of the War
breaks forth: And this will happen,
not only to the actual Hero, who hath
already shewn his Prowess in the Field; 
for that is nothing more than taking a
Pleasure in his own Picture, as Alexander
the Great admired Homer for his
Celebration of Achilles, whom he thought
proper to fix on as a worthy Object of
Admiration; but the would-be Hero,
that young Mind in which the Seeds of
Ambition for martial Glory begin to
struggle and shoot forth, will also find
his Heart beat with Joy, when Hector
arms for the Battle, or Achilles takes
the Field. 
“That the Story of Dido, in the Fourth
Book of Virgil's Æneid, hath the Leaves
generally most soiled in the Closets of
young Gentlemen and Ladies, who will
have no other Employment but that of
seeking after Pleasure, is an Observation
that I am not singular in; but have often 

heard it remarked also by others; 
and have looked with an Eye of Compassion
on the Parents of such Sons and
Daughters, as could find nothing in Virgil
but that Story (excellent as it is in
its Kind) on which they could fix their
Thoughts, or employ their Imaginations; 
whilst, on the other hand, I rejoiced
in my Heart over the Son of a
Friend, whom it was impossible, with
the utmost Art, whilst the Conversation
ran on Virgil, to keep long from
turning his Thoughts with Admiration
on Æneas, when he was bearing his old
Father through the raging Flames. 
Tears of Pleasure started from his Eyes,
and his whole Countenance glowed with
generous Warmth, when the old Anchises
was safely paced out of the Reach
of Danger: And, ‘O that Ascanius may
return the same filial Piety to his Father’,
flowed from his Lips so naturally,
that it seemed to come from his inward
Heart, and to result from the Strength
of his Feeling. My Friend, the Father
of this Youth, sympathized with every
Parent he read of who was blessed with
a worth Son; and his old Eyes sent
forth Floods of Tears on every Story 

which represented an unfortunate Father. 
The whole Lives of this Father
and Son were the strongest Proofs that
Men feel in Reading what they feel in
Life; for they were indeed Pictures of
that Happiness, which parental Kindness
and filial Duty and Affection can reciprocally
bestow. 
“The active beautiful Youth will delight
in the Description of Ascanius,
accompany him with Wishes for his
Victory in the Games, be fearful for his
Danger in the Battle, and rejoice over
his Safety with an uncommon Degree of
Gladness. 
“The Bosom which is warmed with generous
Friendship, will with a trembling
Heart follow Nisus and Euryalus Step by
Step. All their Fears will be alarmed
in Pity for each, should the other be
slaughtered; and when young Euryalus
is slain, will rejoice that Nisus doth not
survive him, to be himself to this Friend's
Memory a mournful feeling Monument,
till he could almost wish to be
as insensible as that Stone of which the 

Monuments for the Dead are composed. 
“The fond Mother will shudder with
Apprehensions with the only remaining
Parent of Euryalus, and feel by Sympathy
every Pang which she knows
must overwhelm her with Sorrow, when
her Son's Destruction shall reach her
Knowlege: And should she herself have
a beloved young Son armed for the
Fight, and initiated in the Trade of
War, the Picture of the Head of Euryalus,
borne home by his Enemies in
Triumph, would haunt here in her
Dreams, and rob her even of her peaceful
Slumbers. 
“The mournful Lady, who is widowed
by the Fate of Arms, will lament with
Andromache, answer her Sigh for Sigh,
join in every pathetic Word, and feel
with a bleeding Heart every Stroke in
which her Sorrows are represented by
the lively Pen of Homer. 
“The Father who is so unfortunate as
to have undutiful Children, will doubly
feel all King Lear's Calamities. He will 

immediately forget every Difference of
Circumstance between himself and the
old King; and, by the Application of
every Pang which Lear endures, to his
own Sufferings, will, tho' unknowingly,
bear Testimony to the inimitable Strokes
of Shakespeare: Whilst the Daughter who
is treated harshly, only because she hath
not the Gift of Flattery, when she is
conscious of the most affectionate and
dutiful Heart, will thoroughly sympathize
with Cordelia, when she is forced
to leave her Father, thro' his own Incapacity
of judging between Love and
Flattery, in the Hands of those deceitful
Sisters, with whose treacherous
Hearts she was well acquainted. 
“The moral Philosopher of Taste will
find the most abundant Matter for his
Entertainment in the Descent of Æneas
into the infernal Shades, where he will
be almost astonished at the judicious
adapting of the Punishments to the
Crimes; and where he will feel the vast
Force of Virgil, by imagining that he
sees and hears what is described so much
to the Life, that for the present he forgets
every other Idea that hath ever 

passed thro' his Mind, or fixed on his
Memory. 
“The truly softened Heart hath a Tear
ready for every human Misfortune which
is represented to his Imagination by
Reading; and the truly hardened Heart
supplies no Moisture which can flow
from the Eyes, but when poor Self alone
is disappointed of any favourite Pursuit; 
and then indeed Sorrow is poured forth
in such abundance, that every dear
Friend is welcome to take his full Share
of such Abundance. 
“There are indeed Men, who, being
insensible to every characteristical and
every pathetic Stroke in the finest Writers,
seek only to laugh, and at the same
time overlook whatever naturally tends
thereto; and are sure always to laugh
where it would become them better to
stifle such unseasonable Mirth. 
“There are also Men who pass by
every Stroke of Humour; and are so
fearful of losing that Reputation for
Sense, which they have built on what
they call Gravity, whilst all the rest of 

Mankind name it Dullness, that they
would not for the World ruffle their
settled Features into a Smile, which they
deem only fit for the Vulgar, and
greatly below their Dignity. 
“There are also fine Gentlemen and
fine Ladies, who, being full of the
Knowlege of the World, wonder at the
vulgar Notions of a Writer who makes
even a Shepherdess of Arcadia talk a
rural, which they call a rustic, Dialect; 
and are desirous to see the Shepherdess
drop the Sheep-hook, assume the Fan,
and talk a courtly Language. These
Critics would like it the better, were the
Scene laid in England, if Corydon, whose
only Care had been tending his Flock,
should every now and then intermix a
French Phrase, to embellish his Discourse,
and give it the Air of being a la mode de
Paris. 
“There are also Men, who, in reading
old Satires, search from Book to Book,
and pore over Notes and Commentators
without End, in order to find the Name
of a Man who has once lived, on whom
to fix Abuse; and plume themselves as 

greatly on such a Discovery, as if they
had found something very useful to
Mankind: And the same Readers, who
deal thus with the Writings of Antiquity,
fail not to peruse modern Books
with equal, or rather with a superior
Degree of Eagerness, to find an Individual
on whom to bestow a Character
justly satirized; for if the Pleasure is
great to affix an Abuse on the Name of
a Man who hath once lived, it must certainly
be much greater to point out a
Man whom he makes sit for a bad or
ridiculous Picture, who is now feeling
and living at this present Writing. 
“But with no such Man would my
Soul wish to hold Acquaintance: I say
not, Friendship; because it would be the
highest Absurdity to suppose such a one
in the least degree capable of being
animated with the generous Warmth
which that Appellation requires. 
“And if any one should think I am
tracing this Matter too curiously, I, who
have considered it in various Shapes,
can only answer with Hamlet, on Horatio's
making the same Objection to his 

philosophical Reflexions, in the Scene of
the Grave-digger, that, in my Opinion,
I can truly say, 

“—Not a Jot;
“it being no more than the natural Result
of examining and considering the
Subject.”
