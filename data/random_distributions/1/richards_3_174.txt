My dearest Lady,
I Have been a little in Disorder, that I have. Some
little Rubs have happen'd. I hope they will be happily
removed. But I am unwilling to believe all that is
said. This is a wicked Town, though! I wish we
were out of it. But I see not when that will be. 
I wish Mr. B. would let me and my Billy go into
Kent: But I don't care to leave him behind me,
neither, and he is not inclin'd to go. Excuse my
Brevity, my dearest Lady! But I must break off, with
only assuring your Ladyship, that I am, and ever
will be, 
Your obliged and grateful
P. B.
