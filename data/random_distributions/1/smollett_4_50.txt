Wagtail introduces me to a set of fine gentlemen,
with whom I spend the evening at
a tavern—our conversation—the
characters of my new companions—the
doctor is roasted—the issue of our debauch. 
I accepted his offer with pleasure, and we went
thither in a hackney-coach, where I saw a great
number of gay figures fluttering about, most of whom
spoke to the doctor with great familiarity. Among
the rest, stood a groupe of them around the fire,
whom I immediately knew to be the very persons
who had the night before, by their laughing,
alarmed my suspicion of the lady who had put
herself under my protection. —They no sooner
perceived me enter with Dr. Wagtail (for that
was my companion's name) than they tittered
and whispered one to another; and I was not a
little surprized to find that they were the gentlemen
to whose acquaintance he designed to recommend
me; for when he observed them together, 

he told me who they were, and desired
to know by what name he should introduce me. 
I satisfied him in that particular, and he advanced
with great gravity, saying, “Gentlemen, your
most obedient—give me leave to introduce
my friend Mr. Random, to your society.” 
Then turning to me, “Mr. Random, this is
Mr. Bragwell—Mr. Banter, Sir—Mr.
Chatter—my friend Mr. Slyboot, and Mr.
Ranter, Sir.” —I saluted each of them in order,
and when I came to take Mr. Slyboot by
the hand, I perceived him thrust his tongue in
his cheek, to the no small entertainment of the
company; but I did not think proper to take
any notice of it, on this occasion. —Mr. Ranter
too, (who I afterwards learned was a player) displayed
his talents, by mimicking my air, features
and voice, while he returned my compliment: 
—This I should not have been so sensible of, had
I not seen him behave in the same manner, to
my friend Wagtail, when he made up to them at
first. —But for once I let him enjoy the fruits of
his dexterity without question or controul, resolved
however, to chastize his insolence at a
more convenient opportunity. —Mr. Slyboot
guessing I was a stranger, asked if I had been
lately in France; and when I answered in the affirmative,
enquired if I had seen the Luxemburg
gallery: I told him, I had considered it
more than once, with great attention: Upon
this a conversation ensued, in which I discovered
him to be a painter. —While we were discoursing
upon the particular pieces of this famous collection,
I overheard Banter ask Dr. Wagtail,
where he had picked up this Mr. Random. —To
which question the physician answered, “Upon 

my word, a mighty pretty sort of a gentleman
—a man of fortune, Sir—he has made
the grand tour—and seen the best company
in Europe, Sir.” —“What, he told you so? 
I suppose, (said the other) I take him to be
neither more nor less than a French valet de
chambre.” —“Oh! barbarous, barbarous!
(cried the doctor) this is actually, upon my
word, altogether unaccountable. —I know all his
family perfectly well, Sir—He's of the Randoms
in the north—a very ancient house,
Sir, and a distant relation of mine.” —I was
extremely nettled at the conjecture of Mr. Banter,
and began to entertain a very indifferent opinion
of my company in general; but as I might
possibly, by their means, acquire a more extensive
and agreeable acquaintance, I determined to
bear these little mortifications as long as I could,
without injuring the dignity of my character. — 
After having talked for some time on the weather,
plays, politicks, and other coffee-house subjects,
it was proposed that we should spend the evening
at a noted tavern in the neighborhood, whither
we repaired in a body. —Having taken possession
of a room, called for French wine, and bespoke
supper, the glass went about pretty freely, and
the characters of my associates opened upon me
more and more. —It soon appeared that the doctor
was entertained as a butt for the painter and
player to exercise their wit upon, for the diversion
of the company. Mr. Ranter began the game,
by asking him what was good for a hoarseness,
lowness of spirits and indigestion, he being troubled
with all these complaints to a very great degree. 
—Wagtail immediately undertook to explain the nature
of his case, and in a very prolix manner, harrangued 

upon prognostics, diagnostics, symptomatics, therapeutics,
inanition, and repletion; then calculated
the force of the stomach and lungs in
their respective operations; ascribed the player's
malady to a disorder in these organs, proceeding
from hard drinking and vociferation, and prescribed
a course of stomachics, with abstinence
from venery, wine, and loud speaking, laughing,
singing, coughing, sneezing or hollowing. — 
“Pah, pah, (cried Ranter, interrupting him)
the remedy is worse than the disease—I wish
I knew where to find some tinder-water.” — 
“Tinder-water! (said the doctor) upon my
word I don't apprehend you, Mr. Ranter.” — 
“Water extracted from tinder (replied the other)
an universal specific for all distempers incident
to man. —It was invented by a learned
German monk, who, for a valuable consideration,
imparted the secret to Paracelsus.” — 
“Pardon me (cried the painter) it was first used
by Solomon, as appears by a Greek manuscript,
in his own hand-writing, lately found at the
foot of mount Lebanon, by a peasant who was
digging for potatoes.” —“Well, (said Wagtail)
in all my vast reading, I never met with
such a preparation! neither did I know till
this minute, that Solomon understood Greek,
or that potatoes grew in Palestine.” — 
Here Banter interposed, saying, he was surprized
that doctor Wagtail should make the least doubt
of Solomon's understanding Greek, when he is
represented to us as the wisest and best educated
prince in the world; and as for potatoes, they
were transplanted thither from Ireland, in the
time of the Crusades, by some knights of that
country. —“I profess (said the doctor) there is 

nothing more likely—I would actually give
a vast sum for a sight of that manuscript, which
must be inestimable—and if I understood the
process, would set about it immediately.” — 
The player assured him, the process was very
simple—that he must cram a hundred weight of
dry tinder into a glass retort, and distilling it by the
force of animal heat, it would yield half a scruple
of insipid water, one drop of which is a full
dose. —“Upon my integrity! (exclaimed the
credulous doctor) this is very amazing and extraordinary!
that a caput mortuum shall yield any
water at all—I must own, I have always been an
enemy to specifics, which I thought inconsistent
with the nature of the animal œconomy; but
certainly the authority of Solomon is not to be
questioned. —I wonder where I shall find a
glass retort large enough to contain such a vast
quantity of tinder, the consumption of which
must undoubtedly raise the price of paper—or
where shall I find animal heat sufficient, even
to warm such a mass.” —Slyboot informed him,
that he might have a retort blown for him as
big as a church, and that the easiest method of
raising the vapour by animal heat, would be to
place it in the middle of an infirmary for feverish
patients, who might lie upon matrasses around,
and in contact with it. —He had no sooner pronounced
these words, than Wagtail exclaimed in
a rapture, “An admirable expedient, as I hope
to be saved! I will positively put it in practice.” 
—This simplicity of the physician
furnished excellent diversion for the company,
who in their turns, sneered at him in ironical
compliments, which his vanity swallowed as the
genuine sentiments of their hearts. —Mr. Chatter, 

impatient of so long a silence, now broke out,
and entertained us with a catalogue of all the
people who danced at the last Hampstead assembly,
with a most circumstantial account of the dress
and ornaments of each, from the lappets of the
ladies to the shoe-buckles of the men; concluding
with telling Bragwell, that his mistress Melinda
was there and seemed to miss him; and solliciting
his company at the next occasion of that
kind. —“No, no, damme (said Bragwell) I
have something else to mind than dangling after
a parcel of giddy-headed girls;—besides,
you know my temper is so unruly, that I am
apt to involve myself in scrapes, when a woman
is concerned. —The last time I was there,
I had an affair with Tom Trippet.” — 
O! I remember that (cried Banter) you
lugged out before the ladies; and I commend
you for so doing, because you had an opportunity
of shewing your manhood, without
running any risk. —“Risk! (said the other
with a fierce countenance) d&wblank;n my blood! 
I fear no risks. —I a'n't afraid of lugging out
against any man that wears a head, damme!
'tis well known I have drawn blood more than
once, and lost some too; but what does that
signify?” —The player begged this champion
to employ him as his second the next time he
intended to kill, for he wanted to see a man
die of a stab, that he might know how to act
such a part the more naturally on the stage. — 
“Die! (replied the hero) No, by G&wblank;d! I
know better things than to incur the verdict of
a Middlesex jury—I should look upon my
fencing-master to be an ignorant son of a
b&wblank;ch, if he had not taught me to prick any 

part of my antagonist's body, that I please to
disable.” —“Oho! (cried Slyboot) if that be
the case, I have a favour to ask: You must
know I am employed to paint a Jesus on the
cross; and my purpose is to represent him at
that point of time, when the spear is thrust
into his side. —Now I should be glad you
would, in my presence, pink some impertinent
fellow into convulsions, without endangering
his life, that I may have an opportunity of
taking a good clever agony from nature: — 
The doctor will direct you where to enter,
and how far to go; but pray let it be as near
the left side as possible.” —Wagtail, who took
this proposal seriously, observed, that it would be
a very difficult matter to penetrate into the left
side of the thorax, without hurting the heart,
and of consequence killing the patient; but he
believed it was possible for a man of a very nice
hand, and exact knowledge of anatomy, to wound
the diaphragma somewhere about the skirts,
which might induce a singultus, without being
attended with death;—that he was ready to demonstrate
the insertion of that muscle to Mr.
Bragwell; but desired to have no concern with
the experiment, which might essentially prejudice
his reputation in case of a miscarriage. —Bragwell
was as much imposed upon by the painter's waggery
as the doctor, and declined engaging in the
affair, saying, he had a very great regard for
Mr. Slyboot, but had laid it down as a maxim,
never to fight except when his honour was engaged. 
—A thousand jokes of this kind were
passed; the wine circulated, supper was served
in, we eat heartily, returned to the bottle, Bragwell
became noisy and troublesome, Banter grew 

more and more severe, Ranter rehearsed, Slyboot
made faces at the whole company, I sung French
catches, and Chatter kissed me with great affection; 
while the doctor with a woful countenance,
sat silent like a disciple of Pythagoras. — 
At length, it was proposed by Bragwell, that
we should scour the hundreds, sweat the constable,
maul the watch, and then reel soberly to
bed. 
While we deliberated upon this expedition,
the waiter came into the room, and asked for
doctor Wagtail; when he understood he was
present, he told him, there was a lady below to
enquire for him; at which the physician started
from his melancholy contemplation, and with a
look of extreme confusion, assured the company,
he could not possibly be the person wanted, for
he had no connexion with any lady whatever; 
and bid the drawer tell her so. —“For shame!
(cried Banter) would you be so impolite as
to refuse a lady the hearing? perhaps she comes
for a consultation. —It must be some extraordinary
affair that brings a lady to a tavern
at this time o'night. —Mr. Ranter, pray do the
doctor's baise-mains to the lady, and squire her
hither.” —The player immediately staggered
out, and returned, leading in with much ceremony,
a tall strapping wench, whose appearance
proclaimed her condition. We received her
with the utmost solemnity, and with a good deal
of intreaty she was persuaded to sit, when a prosound
silence ensued, during which she fixed her
eyes, with a disconsolate look, upon the doctor,
who was utterly confounded at her behaviour,
and returned her melancholy sour-fold; at length,
after a good many piteous sighs, she wiped her 

eyes, and accosted him thus: “What! not one
word of comfort? Will nothing soften that
stony heart of thine? Not all my tears! not
all my affliction! Not the inevitable ruin
thou hast brought upon me! Where are
thy vows, thou faithless perjured man? — 
Hast thou no honour?—no conscience— 
no remorse for thy perfidious conduct towards
me!—answer me, wilt thou at last
do me justice, or must I have recourse to heaven
and hell for my revenge!” —If poor
Wagtail was amazed before she spoke, what
must his confusion be on hearing this address. 
His natural paleness changed into a ghastly clay
colour, his eyes rolled, his lip trembled, and he
answered in an accent not to be described;— 
“Upon my word, honour, and salvation! madam,
you are actually mistaken in my person,
—I have a most particular veneration for
your sex, madam, and am actually incapable
of injuring any lady in the smallest degree,
madam,—besides, madam, to the best of my
recollection, I never had the honour of seeing
you before, as I hope to be saved, madam!” 
“—How, traitor! (cried she) dost thou disown
me then? —Mistaken! no,—too well
I know that fair bewitching face! too well I
know that false enchanting tongue! alas!
gentlemen, since the villain compels me, by
his unkindness, to expose myself and him,
know, that this betrayer, under the specious
pretence of honourable addresses, won my
heart, and taking advantage of his conquest,
robbed me of my virgin treasure, and afterwards
abandoned me to my fate! —I am now four
months gone with child by him, turned out 

of doors by my relations, and left a prey to
misery and want! Yes, thou Barbarian
(said she, turning to Wagtail) thou tiger,
thou Succubus! too well thou knowest my
situation—but I will tear out thy faithless heart,
and deliver the world from such a monster.” 
—So saying, she sprung forward at the doctor,
who, with incredible agility, jumped over the
table and got behind Bragwell, while the rest of
us endeavoured to appease the furious heroine— 
Although every body in the company affected
the utmost surprize, I could easily perceive it was
a scheme concerted among them, to produce
diversion at the doctor's expence; and being under
no concern about the consequence, I entered
into the confederacy, and enjoy'd the distress of
Wagtail, who with tears in his eyes, begged the
protection of the company, declaring himself as
innocent of the crime laid to his charge, as the
fœtus in utero; and hinting at the same time,
that nature had not put it in his power to be
guilty of such a trespass—“Nature! (cried the
lady,) there was no nature in the case—he
abused me by the help of charms and spells; 
else how is it possible, that any woman could
have listened to the addresses of such a scarecrow? 
—Were these owlish eyes made for ogling; 
that carrion complexion to be admired; 
or that mouth like a horse-shoe to be kissed? 
No, no, you owe your success to your philtres,
to your drugs and incantations; and not to
your natural talents, which are in every respect
mean and contemptible”—The doctor now
thought he had got an opportunity of vindicating
himself effectually; and desired the complainant 

to compose herself but for half an hour, in which
he undertook to prove the absurdity of believing
in the power of incantations, which were only
idle dreams of ignorance and superstition. —He
accordingly pronounced a very learned discourse
upon the nature of ideas, the powers and independance
of the mind, the properties of stimulating
medicines, the difference between a proneness
to venery, which many simples would create, and
a passion limited to one object, which can only
be the result of sense and reflection; and concluded
with a pathetic remonstrance, setting forth
his unhappiness of being persecuted with the resentment
of a lady whom he had never injured, nor
even seen before that occasion, and whose faculties
were, in all likelihood, so much impaired by her
misfortunes, that an innocent person was in danger
of being ruined by her disorder. —He had no
sooner finished his harrangue, than the forlorn
princess began her lamentations afresh, and cautioned
the company against his eloquence, which; 
she said, was able to byass the most impartial
bench in christendom. —Banter advised him to
espouse her immediately, as the only means to
salve his reputation, and offered to accompany
him to the Fleet for that purpose; but Slyboot
proposed that a father should be purchased for the
child, and a comfortable alimony settled on the
mother. Ranter promised to adopt the infant
gratis. Wagtail was ready to worship him for
his generosity; and though he persisted in protesting
his innocence, condescended to every thing
rather than his unblemished character should be
called in question. —The lady rejected the expedient,
and insisted on matrimony. Bragwell
took up the cudgels for the doctor, and undertook 

to rid him of her importunity, for half a
guinea; upon which Wagtail, with great eagerness,
pulled out his purse and put it into the hand
of his friend, who taking half a piece out of it,
gave it to the plaintiff, and bid her thank God
for her good fortune. When she had received
this bounty, she affected to weep, and begged,
since the physician had renounced her, he would
at least vouchsafe her a parting kiss; this he was
prevailed upon to grant, with great reluctance,
and went up, with his usual solemnity, to salute
her; she laid hold of his cheek with her teeth
and held fast, while he roared with anguish, to
the unspeakable diversion of all present. When
she thought proper to release him, she dropped a
low courtesy to the company, and quitted the room,
leaving the doctor in the utmost horror, not so
much on account of the pain, as the apprehension
of the consequence of the bite; for by this
time, he was convinced of her being mad. Banter
prescribed the actual cautery, and put the
poker in the fire to be heated, in order to fear
the place. —The player was of opinion that Bragwell
should scoop out the part affected with the
point of his sword; but the painter prevented
both these dreadful operations, by recommending
a balsam he had in his pocket, which never failed
to cure the bite of a mad dog: With these
words, he pulled out a small bladder of black paint,
with which he instantly anointed not only the
sore, but the greatest part of the patient's face,
and left it in a frightful condition. —In short,
the poor creature was so harrassed with fear and
vexation, that I pitied him extremely, and sent
him home in a chair, contrary to the inclination
of every body present. 

This freedom of mine, gave umbrage to
Bragwell, who testified his displeasure, by swearing
a few threats, without making any application; 
which was no sooner perceived by Slyboot, who
sat by me, than with a view of promoting a
quarrel, he whispered to me, that he thought
Bragwell used me very ill; but every man was
the best judge of his own affairs. —I answered
aloud, that I would neither suffer Mr. Bragwell
nor him to use me ill with impunity; and that
I stood in no need of his counsel in regard to the
regulation of my conduct. —He thought proper
to ask a thousand pardons, and assure me, he
meant no offence; while Bragwell feigned himself
asleep, that he might not be obliged to take
notice of what passed. —But the player, who had
more animal spirits, and less prudence than Slyboot,
unwilling to let the affair rest, where he
had dropt it, jogged Mr. Bragwell, and told him
softly, that I called him names, and threatned
to cudgel him. —This I understood by his starting
up and crying, “Blood and wounds! you
lie—No man durst treat me so ignominiously,
—Mr. Random, did you call me names, and
threaten to drub me?” I denied the imputation,
and proposed to punish the scoundrel, who endeavoured
to foment disturbance in the company; 
Bragwell signified his approbation, and drew his
sword; I did the same, and accosted the actor
in these words, “Lookee, Mr. Banter, I know
you possess all the mimickry and mischievous
qualities of an ape, because I have observed
you put them all in practice more than once
to-night, on me and others; now I want to see
if you resemble one in nimbleness also; therefore
I desire you to leap over this sword without 

hesitation;” so saying, I held it parallel to
the horizon, at the distance of about three feet from
the floor, and called, “Once—twice—thrice, and
away;”—but instead of complying with my
command, he snatched his hat and hanger, and
assuming the looks, swagger, and phrase of Pistol,
burst out in the following exclamation, “Ha! must
I then perform inglorious prank, of Sylvan
ape in mountain forest caught! Death rock
me asleep, abridge my doleful days, and lay
my hand in fury's lap—Have we not
Hiren here?” —This buffoonery did not
answer his expectation, for by this time the company
was bent on seeing him in a new character. 
Mr. Banter desired me to hold my sword a foot
or two higher, that he might have the better opportunity
of exerting himself. —The painter told
him, if he performed well, he would recommend
him as a vaulter to the proprietors of Sadler's
Wells; and Bragwell crying, “Leap for the
king,” applied the point of his sword to the
player's posteriors, with such success, that he
sprung over in a trice, and finding the door unguarded,
vanished in a twinkling; glad, no doubt,
of having paid his share of the reckoning so
easily. 
It being now near two a-clock in the morning,
we discharged the bill, and sallied out into the
street. —The painter slunk away without taking
his leave. —Billy Chatter being unable to speak
or stand, was sent to a Bagnio; and Banter and
I accompanied Bragwell to Moll King's coffee-house,
where after he had kicked half a dozen of
hungry whores, we left him asleep on a bench, and
directed our course towards Charing-Cross, near
which place both he and I lodged. 

The natural dryness of my companion being
overcome by liquor, he honoured me by the way
with many compliments and processions of friendship,
for which I made suitable acknowledgments,
and told him, I thought myself happy in having,
by my behaviour, removed the unfavourable opinion
he entertained of me at first sight. —He
was surprized at this declaration, and begged me
to explain myself: Upon which I mentioned
what I had over-heard him say of me to Wagtail,
in the coffee-house. —He laughed, and made
an apology for his freedom, assuring me, that
my appearance had very much prepossessed him in
my favour; and what he said, was only intended
as a joke on the doctor's solemnity. —I was
highly pleased at being undeceived in this particular,
and not a little proud of the good opinion
of this wit, who shook me by the hand at
parting, and promised to meet me next day at
the ordinary.
