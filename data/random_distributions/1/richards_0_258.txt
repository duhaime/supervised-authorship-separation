Mr. Lovelace, To John Belford, Esq; 

Tuesday Morn. June 13. 
And now, Belford, I can go no farther. The
affair is over. Clarissa lives. And I am 
Your humble servant,
R. Lovelace. 
The whole of this black transaction is given by the
injured lady, to Miss Howe, in her subsequent
letters, dated Thursday July 6. To which the
reader is referred.
