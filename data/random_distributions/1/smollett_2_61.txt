DEAR DOCTOR,
IF I was disposed to be critical, I should say
this house of Cameron is too near the lake, which
approaches, on one side, to within six or seven
yards of the window. It might have been placed
in a higher site, which would have afforded a more
extensive prospect and a drier atmosphere; but
this imperfection is not chargeable on the present
proprietor, who purchased it ready built, rather
than be at the trouble of repairing his own family-house
of Bonhill, which stands two miles from
hence on the Leven, so surrounded with plantation,
that it used to be known by the name of the Mavis
(or thrush) Nest. Above that house is a romantic
glen or clift of a mountain, covered with hanging
woods having at bottom a stream of fine water
that forms a number of cascades in its descent to
join the Leven, so that the scene is quite enchanting. 
A captain of a man of war, who had made
the circuit of the globe with Mr. Anson, being
conducted to this glen, exclaimed, “Juan Fernandez,
by God!” 
Indeed, this country would be a perfect paradise,
if it was not, like Wales, cursed with a
weeeping climate, owing to the same causes in both,
the neighbourhood of high mountains, and a
westerly situation, exposed to the vapours of the
Atlantic ocean. This air, however, notwithstanding 

its humidity, is so healthy, that the natives
are scarce ever visited by any other disease
than the small-pox, and certain cutaneous evils,
which are the effects of dirty living, the great and
general reproach of the commonalty of this kingdom. 
Here are a great many living monuments
of longævity; and among the rest a person, whom
I treat with singular respect, as a venerable druid,
who has lived near ninety years, without pain or
sickness, among oaks of his own planting. —He
was once proprietor of these lands: but being of
a projecting spirit, some of his schemes miscarried,
and he was obliged to part with his possession,
which hath shifted hands two or three times since
that period; but every succeeding proprietor hath
done every thing in his power, to make his old
age easy and comfortable. He has a sufficiency to
procure the necessaries of life; and he and his old
woman resided in a small convenient farm-house,
having a little garden which he cultivates with his
own hands. This ancient couple live in great
health, peace, and harmony, and, knowing no
wants, enjoy the perfection of content. Mr.
Smollett calls him the admiral, because he insists
upon steering his pleasure-boat upon the lake; 
and he spends most of his time in ranging through
the woods, which he declares he enjoys as much
as if they were still his own property —I asked him
the other day, if he was never sick, and he answered,
Yes; he had a slight fever the year before
the union. If he was not deaf, I should take
much pleasure in his conversation; for he is very
intelligent and his memory is surprisingly retensive 
—These are the happy effects of temperance,
exercise, and good nature —Notwithstanding all
his innocence, however, he was the cause of great
perturbation to my man Clinker, whose natural
superstition has been much injured, by the histories 

of witches, fairies, ghosts, and goblins, which
he has heard in this country —On the evening after
our arrival, Humphry strolled into the Wood,
in the course of his meditation, and all at once
the admiral stood before him, under the shadow of
a spreading oak. Through the fellow is far from
being timorous in cases that are not supposed preternatural,
he could not stand the sight of this apparition,
but ran into the kitchen, with his hair
standing on end, staring wildly, and deprived of
utterance. Mrs. Jenkins, seeing him in this condition,
screamed aloud, “Lord have mercy upon
us, he has seen something!” Mrs. Tabitha was
alarmed, and the whole house in confusion. 
When he was recruited with a dram, I desired
him to explain the meaning of all this agitation; 
and, with some reluctance, he owned he had seen
a spirit, in the shape of an old man with a white
beard, a black cap, and a plaid night gown. He
was undeceived by the admiral in person, who
coming in at this juncture, appeared to be a creature
of real flesh and blood. 
Do you know how we fare in this Scottish paradise? 
We make free with our landlord's mutton,
which is excellent, his poultry-yard, his garden,
his dairy, and his cellar, which are all well
stored. We have delicious salmon, pike, trout,
perch, par, &c. at the door, for the taking. The
Frith of Clyde, on the other side of the hill, supplies
us with mullet, red and grey, cod, mackarel,
whiting, and a variety of sea fish, including the
finest fresh herrings I ever tasted. We have sweet,
juicy beef, and tolerable veal, with delicate bread
from the little town of Dumbritton; and plenty
of partridge, growse, heath-cock, and other game
in presents. 
We have been visited by all the gentlemen in
the neighbourhood, and the have entertained us 

at their houses, not barely with hospitality, but
with such marks of cordial affection, as one would
wish to find among near relations, after an absence
of many years. 
I told you, in my last, I had projected an excursion
to the Highlands, which project I have
now happily executed, under the auspices of Sir
George Colquhoun, a colonel in the Dutch service,
who offered himself as our conductor on this
occasion. Leaving our women at Cameron, to
the care and inspection of Lady H&wblank; C&wblank;,
we set out on horseback for Inverary, the county
town of Argyle, and dined on the road with the
Laird of Macfarlane, the greatest genealogist I
ever knew in any country, and perfectly acquainted
with all the antiquities of Scotland. 
The duke of Argyle has an old castle at Inverary,
where he resides when he is in Scotland; and
hard by is the shell of a noble Gothic palace, built
by the last duke, which, when finished, will be a
great ornament to this part of the Highlands. As
for Inverary, it is a place of very little importance. 
This country is amazingly wild, especially towards
the mountains, which are heaped upon the
backs of one another, making a most stupendous
appearance of savage nature, with hardly any
signs of cultivation, or even of population. All
is sublimity, silence and solitude. The people
live together in glens or bottoms, where they are
sheltered from the cold and storms of winter: but
there is a margin of plain ground spread along the
sea side, which is well inhabited and improved by
the arts of husbandry; and this I take to be one of
the most agreeable tracts of the whole island; the
sea not only keeps it warm, and suplies it with
fish, but affords one of the most ravishing prospects
in the whole world; I mean the appearance
of the Hebrides, or Western Islands, to the number 

of three hundred, scattered as far as the eye
can reach, in the most agreeable confusion. As
the soil and climate of the Highlands are but ill
adapted to the cultivation of corn, the people apply
themselves chiefly to the breeding and feeding
of black cattle, which turn to good account, 
Those animals run wild all the winter, without
any shelter or subsistance, but what they can find
among the heath. When the snow lies so deep
and hard, that they cannot penetrate to the roots
of the grass, they make a diurnal progress, guided
by a sure instinct, to the sea-side at low water,
where they feed on the alga marina, and other
plants that grow upon the beach. 
Perhaps this branch of husbandry, which requires
very little attendance and labour, is one of
the principal causes of that idleness and want of
industry, which distinguishes these mountaineers
in their own country —When they come forth into
the world they become a diligent and alert as
any people upon earth. They are undoubtedly a
very distinct-species from their fellow-subjects of
the Lowlands, against whom they indulge an ancient
spirit of animosity; and this difference is
very discernible even among persons of family and
education. The Lowlanders are generally cool
and circumspect, the Highlanders fiery and ferocious:
but this violence of their passions serves
only to inflame the zeal of their devotion to strangers,
which is truly enthusiastic. 
We proceeded about twenty miles beyond Inverary,
to the house of a gentleman, a friend of our
conductor, where we stayed a few days, and were
feasted in such a manner, that I began to dread
the consequence to my constitution. 
Notwithstanding the solitude that prevails among
these mountains, there is no want of people in the
Highlands, I am credibly informed that the duke 

of Argyle can assemble five thousand men in arms,
of his own clan and surname, which is Campbell; 
and there is besides a tribe of the same appellations,
whose chief is the Earl of Breadalbine. The
Macdonalds are as numerous, and remarkably
warlike: the Camerons, M'Leods, Frasers,
Grants, M'Kenzies, M'Kays, M'Phersons,
M'Intoshes, are powerful clans; so that if all the
Highlanders, including the inhabitants of the Isles,
were united, they could bring into the field an
army of forty thousand fighting men, capable of
undertaking the most dangerous enterprize. We
have lived to see four thousand of them, without
discipline, throw the whole kingdom of Great
Britain into confusion. They attacked and defeated
two armies of regular troops, accustomed to
service. They penetrated into the centre of England; 
and afterwards marched back with deliberation,
in the face of two other armies, through an
enemy's country, where every precaution was
taken to cut off their retreat. I know not any
other people in Europe, who, without the use or
knowledge of arms, will attack regular forces sword
in hand, if their chief will head them in battle. 
When disciplined, they cannot fail of being excellent
soldiers. They do not walk like the generality
of mankind, but trot and bounce like deer,
as if they moved upon springs. They greatly excel
the Lowlanders in all the exercises that require
agility; the are incredibly abstemious, and patient
of hunger and fatigue; so steeled against the weather,
that in travelling, even when the ground is
covered with snow, they never look for a house, or
any other shelter but their plaid, in which they
wrap themselves up, and go to sleep under the cope
of heaven. Such people, in quality of soldiers,
must be invincible, when the business is to perform
quick marches in a difficult country, to strike 

sudden strokes, beat up the enemy's quarters, harass
their cavalry, and perform expeditions without
the formality of magazines, baggage, forage,
and artillery. The chieftainship of the Higlanders
is a very dangerous influence operating at the
extremity of the island, where the eyes and hands
of government cannot be supposed to see and act
with precision and vigour. In order to break the
force of clanship, administration has always practised
the political maxim, Divide et impera. The
legislature hath not only disarmed these mountaineers,
but also deprived them of their ancient
garb, which contributed in a great measure to
keep up their military spirit; and their slavish tenures
are dissolved by act of parliament; so that
they are at present as free and independent of their
chiefs, as the law can make them: but the original
attachment still remains, and is founded on
something prior to the feudal system, about which
the writers of this age have made such a pother,
as if it was a new discovery, like the Copernican
system.: Every peculiarity of policy, custom, and
even temperament, is affectedly traced to this origin,
as if the feudal constitution had not been
common to almost all the natives of Europe. For
my part, I expect to see the use of trunk-hose and
buttered ale ascribed to the influence of the feudal
system. The connection between the clans and
their chiefs is, without all doubt, patriarchal. It
is founded on hereditary regard and affection, cherished
through a long succession of ages. The
clan consider the chief as their father, they bear
his name, they believe themselves descended from
his family, and they obeyed him as their lord, with
all the ardour of filial love and veneration; while
he, on his part, exerts a paternal authority, commanding,
chastising, rewarding, protecting, and
maintaining them as his own children. If the legislature 

would entirely destroy this connection, it
must compel the Highlanders to change their habitation
and their names. Even this experiment
has been formerly tried without success —In the
reign of James VI. a battle was fought within a
few short miles of this place, between two clans,
the M'Gregors and the Colquhouns, in which
the latter were defeated: the Laird of M'Gregor
made such a barbarous use of his victory, that he
was forfeited and outlawed by act of parliament:
his lands were given to the family of Montrose,
and his clan were obliged to change their name. 
The obeyed so far, as to call themselves severally
Campbell, Graham, or Drummond, the surnames
of the families of Argyle, Montrose, and Perth,
that they might enjoy the protection of those
houses; but they still added M'Gregor to their
new appellation; and as their chief was deprived
of his estate, they robbed and plundered for his
subsistence. —Mr. Cameron of Lochiel, the chief
of that clan, whose father was attainted for having
been concerned in the last rebellion, returning
from France in obedience to a proclamation and
act of parliament, passed at the beginning of the
late war, payed a visit to his own country, and hired
a farm in the neighbourhood of his father's
house, which had been burnt to the ground. The
clan, though ruined and scattered, no sooner heard
of his arrival than they stocked to him from all
quarters, to welcome his return, and in a few
days stocked his farm with seven hundred black
cattle, which they had saved in the general wreck
of their affairs: but their beloved chief, who was
a promising youth, did not live to enjoy the fruits
of their fidelity and attachment. 
The most effectual method I know to weaken,
and at length destroy this influence, is to employ
the commonalty in such a manner to give them 

a taste of property and independence —In vain the
government grants them advantageous leases on the
forfeited estates, if they have no property to prosecute
the means of improvement —The sea is an
exhaustible fund of riches; but the fishery cannot
be carried on without vessels, casks, salt, lines,
nets, and other tackle. I conversed with a sensible
man of this country, who, from a real spirit
of patriotism, had set up a fishery on the coast,
and a manufacture of coarse linen, for the employment
of the poor Highlanders. Cod is here in
such plenty, that he told me he had seen seven
hundred taken on one line, at one hawl —It must
be observed, however, that the line was of immense
length, and had two thousand hooks, baited
with muscles; but the fish was so superior to the
cod caught on the banks of Newfoundland, that
his corespondent at Lisbon sold them immediately
at his own price, although Lent was just over
when they arrived, and the people might be supposed
quite cloyed with this kind of diet —His linen
manufacture was likewise in a prosperous way,
when the late war intervening, all his best hands
were pressed into the service. 
It cannot be expected, that the gentlemen of
this country should execute commercial schemes
to render their vassals independent; nor, indeed,
are such schemes suited to their way of life and inclination; 
but a company of merchants might,
with proper management, turn to good account a
fishery established in this part of Scotland —Our
people have a strange itch to colonize America,
when the uncultivated parts of our own island
might be settled to greater advantage. 
After having rambled through the mountains
and glens of Argyle, we visited the adjacent islands
of Ila, Jura, Mull, and Icolmkill. In the first,
we saw the remains of a castle, built in a lake, 

where Macdonald, lord or king of the isles, formerly
resided. Jura is famous for having given
birth to one Mackcrain, who lived one hundred
and eighty years in one house, and died in the
reign of Charles the Second. Mull affords several
bays, where there is safe anchorage; in one of
which, the Florida, a ship of the Spanish armada,
was blown up by one of Mr. Smollett's ancestors 
—About forty years ago, John duke of Argyle is
said to have consulted the Spanish registers, by
which it appeared, that this ship had the military
chest on board —He employed experienced divers
to examine the wreck; and they found the hull of
the vessel still entire, but so covered with sand,
that they could not make their way between decks; 
however, they picked up several pieces of plate,
that were scattered about in the bay, and a couple
of fine brass cannon. 
I colmkill, or Iona, is a small island which St.
Columba chose for his habitation —It was respected
for its sanctity, and college or seminary of ecclesiastics 
—Part of its church is still standing, with
the tombs of several Scottish, Irish, and Danish
sovereigns, who were here intered —These islanders
are very bold and dexterous watermen, consequently
the better adapted to the fishery: in their
manners they are less savage and impetuous than
their countrymen on the continent; and they speak
the Erse or Gaelick in its greatest purity. 
Having sent round our Horses by land, we embarked
in the district of Cowal, for Greenock,
which is a neat little town, on the other side of the
Frith, with a curious harbour, formed by three
stone jetties, carried out a good way into the sea — 
Newport-Glasgow is such another place, about
two miles higher up —Both have a face of business
and plenty, and are supported entirely by the 

shipping of Glasgow, of which I counted sixty
large vessels in these harbours —Taking boat again
at Newport, we were in less than an hour landed
on the other side, within two short miles of our
head-quarters, where we found our women in good
health and spirits —They had been two days before
joined by Mr. Smollett and his lady, to whom
we have such obligations as I cannot mention,
even to you, without blushing. 
To-morrow we shall bid adieu to the Scotch
Arcadia, and begin our progress to the southward,
taking our way by Lanerk and Nithsdale, to the
west borders of England. I have received so
much advantage and satisfaction from this tour,
that if my health suffers no revolution in the winter,
I believe I shall be tempted to undertake another
expedition to the Northern extremity of Caithness,
unencumbered by those impediments which
now clog the heels of, 
yours,
Matt. Bramble. 
Cameron, Sept. 6.
