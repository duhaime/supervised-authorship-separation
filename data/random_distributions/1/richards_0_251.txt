Mr. Lovelace, To John Belford, Esq; 

Sunday afternoon. 
O Belford! what a hair's-breadth escape have I
had! —Such a one, that I tremble between
terror and joy, at the thoughts of what might have
happen'd, and did not. 
What a perverse girl is this, to contend with her
fate, yet has reason to think, that her very stars
fight against her! I am the luckiest of men! —But
my breath almost fails me, when I reflect upon what
a slender thread my destiny hung. 
But not to keep thee in suspense; I have, within
this half-hour, obtained possession of the expected
letter from Miss Howe—And by such an accident! 
But here, with the former, I dispatch this; thy
messenger waiting.
