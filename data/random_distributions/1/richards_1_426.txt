Mr. Lovelace, To John Bedford, Esq; 

Tuesday, Aug. 15. 
Thank thee, Jack; most heartily I thank thee,
for the sober conclusion of thy last! —I have a
good mind, for the sake of it, to forgive thy till-now
absolutely unpardonable Extracts. 
But dost think I will lose such an angel, such a
forgiving angel, as this? —By my Soul, I will not!
—To pray for mercy for such an ungrateful miscreant! 
—How she wounds me, how she cuts me to the Soul,
by her exalted generosity! —But She must have mercy
upon me first! —Then will she teach me a reliance
for the sake of which her prayer for me will be answered. 
But hasten, hasten to me, particulars of her health,
of her employments, of her conversation. 
I am sick only of Love! —O that I could have called
her mine! —It would then have been worth while
to be sick! —To have sent for her down to me from
town; and to have had her, with healing in her dove-like
wings, flying to my comfort; her duty and her
choice to pray for me, and to bid me live for her sake! 
—O Jack! what an Angel have I— 
But I have not lost her! —I will not lose her! I am
almost well; should be quite well but for these prescribing
rascals, who, to do credit to their skill, will
make the disease of importance. —And I will make
her mine! —And be sick again, to entitle myself to
her dutiful tenderness, and pious as well as personal
concern! 
God for ever bless her! —Hasten, hasten particulars
of her! —I am sick of Love! —Such generous
goodness! —By all that's Great and Good, I will not
lose her! —So tell her! —She says, That she could
not pity me, if she thought of being mine! This, 

according to Miss Howe's transcriptions to Charlotte. 
—But bid her hate me, and have me: And my behaviour
to her shall soon turn that Hate to Love! — 
For, body and mind, I will be wholly hers.
