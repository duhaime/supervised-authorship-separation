Fathom justifies the proverb, “What's bred in
the bone will never come out of the flesh.” 
Some circumstances of this conversation
made a deep impression upon the mind of
our adventurer, who nevertheless concealed his
emotions from the knowledge of his friend,
and was next day introduced to that hidden
treasure of which Renaldo had spoke with such
rapture and adoration. It was not without
reason he had expatiated upon the personal
attractions of this young lady, whom (for the
present) we shall call Monimia, a name that
implies her orphan situation. When she entered
the room, even Fathom, whose eyes had
been sated with beauty, was struct dumb with
admiration, and could scarce recollect himself 

so far as to perform the ceremony of his introduction. 
She seemed to be about the age of eighteen:
her stature was tall; her motion graceful; a
knot of artificial flowers restrained the luxuriancy
of her fine black hair that flowed in shining
ringlets a down her snowy neck. The
contour of her face was oval; her forehead
remarkably high; her complexion clean and
delicate, though not florid; and her eyes were
so piercing as to strike the soul of every beholder:
yet, upon this occasion, one half of
their vivacity was eclipsed by a languishing air
of melancholy concern; which, while it in a
manner sheathed the edge of her beauty, added
a most engaging sweetness to her looks; 
in short, every feature was elegantly perfect; 
and the harmony of the whole ravishing and
delightful. 
It was easy to perceive the mutual sentiments
of the two lovers, at meeting, by the pleasure
that sensibly diffused itself in the countenances
of both. Fathom was received by her as the
intimate friend of her admirer, whom she had
often heard of in terms of the most sincere
affection; and the conversation was carried on
in the Italian language, because she was a
foreigner who had not as yet made great proficiency
in the knowledge of the English
tongue. Her understanding was such, as, instead
of diminishing, reinforced the prepossession
which was inspired by her appearance; 
and if the sum total of her charms could not
melt the heart, it at least excited the appetite
of Fathom to such a degree, that he gazed
upon her with such violence of desire, as had 

never transported him before; and instantly
began to harbour thoughts, not only destructive
to the peace of his generous patron, but also
to the prudential maxims he had adopted on
his first entrance into life. 
We have already recorded divers instances
of his conduct, to prove that there was an intemperance
in his blood, which often interfered
with his caution: and although he had
sound means to render this heat sometimes
subservient to his interest; yet, in all probability,
Heaven mingled the ingredient in his constitution,
on purpose to counteract his consummate
craft, defeat the villainy of his intention, and,
at last, expose him to the justice of the law,
and the contempt of his fellow creatures. 
Stimulated as he was by the beauty of the
incomparable Monimia, he foresaw that the
conquest of her heart would cost him a thousand
times more labour and address than all
the victories he had ever atchieved: for besides
her superior understanding, her sentiments
of honour, virtue, gratitude, religion, and
pride of birth, her heart was already engaged
by the tenderest ties of love and obligation, to
a man whose person and acquired accomplishments
at least equalled his own; and whose
connexion with him was of such a nature, as
raised an almost insurmountable bar to his design:
because, with what face could he commence
rival to the person whose family had
raised him from want and servility, and whose
own generosity had rescued him from the miseries
of a dreary jail? 
Notwithstanding these reflections, he would
not lay aside an idea which so agreeably flattered 

his imagination. He, like every other
projector in the same circumstances, was
so partial to his own qualifications, as to
think the lady would soon perceive a difference
between him and Renaldo that could not fail
to turn to his advantage in her opinion. He
depended a good deal on the levity and inconstancy
of the sex; and did not doubt, that, in
the course of their acquaintance, he should
profit by that languor which often creeps upon
and flattens the intercourse of lovers cloyed
with the sight and conversation of each other. 
This way of arguing was very natural to a
man, who had never known other motives
than those of sensuality and convenience; and
perhaps, upon these maxims, he might have
succeeded with nine tenths of the fair sex:
but, for once, he erred in his calculation. 
Monimia's soul was perfect: her virtue impregnable. 
His first approaches were, as usual,
performed by the method of insinuation,
which succeeded so well, that in a few days,
he actually acquired a very distinguished share
of her favour and esteem: to this he had been
recommended in the warmest strain of exaggerating
friendship, by her dear Renaldo; so that
placing the most unreserved confidence in his
honour and integrity, and being almost quite
destitute of acquaintance, she made no scruple
of owning herself pleased with his company
and conversation; and therefore he was never
abridg'd in point of opportunity. She had
too much discernment to overlook his uncommon
talents and agreeable address, and too
much susceptibility to observe them with indifference. 
She not only regarded him as the 

confident of her lover, but admired him as a
person whose attachment did honour to Count
Melvil's choice: she found his discourse remarkably
entertaining, his politeness dignified
with an air of uncommon sincerity; and she
was ravished with his skill in musick, an art of
which she was deeply enamoured. 
While he thus ingratiated himself with the
fair Monimia, Renaldo rejoiced at their intimacy,
being extremely happy in the thought
of having found a friend who could amuse
and protect the dear creature in his absence. 
That she might be the better prepared for the
temporary separation which he meditated, he
began to be less frequent in his visits, or rather
to interrupt, by gradual intermissions, the
constant attendance he had bestowed upon her
since her mother's death. This alteration she
was enabled to bear by the assiduities of Fathom,
when she understood that her lover was
indispensibly employed in negotiating a sum of
money for the purposes of his intended voyage. 
This was really the case: for, as the reader hath
been already informed, the provision he had
made for that emergency was expeded in behalf
of our adventurer; and the persons of
whom he had borrowed it, far from approving
of the use to which it was put, and accommodating
him with a fresh supply, reproached
him with his benevolence as an act of dishonesty
to them, and, instead of favouring this second
application, threatened to distress him
for what he had already received. While he
endeavoured to surmount these difficulties, his
small reversion was quite exhausted, and he 

saw himself on the brink of wanting the common
necessaries of life. 
There was no difficulty which he could not
have encountered with fortitude, had he alone
been concerned: but his affection and regard
for Monimia were of such a delicate nature,
that, far from being able to bear the prospect
of her wanting the least convenience, he could
not endure that she should suspect her situation
cost him a moment's perplexity; because
he foresaw it would wring her gentle heart
with unspeakable anguish and vexation. This
therefore he endeavoured to anticipate by expressions
of confidence in the emperor's equity,
and frequent declarations touching the
goodness and security of that credit from
which he derived his present subsistence.
