The captain enraged, threatens to put the madman
to death with his own hand—is
diverted from that resolution by the arguments
and persuasion of the first lieutenant
and surgeon—we set sail for St. Helens,
join the fleet under the command of Sir
C&wblank;n&wblank;r O&wblank;le, and proceed for the
West-Indies—are overtaken by a terrible
tempest—my friend Jack Rattlin has his
leg broke by a fall from the main-yard— 
the behaviour of doctor Mackshane— 
Jack opposes the amputation of his limb,
in which he is seconded by Morgan and me,
who undertake the cure, and perform it
successfully. 
The captain was carried into his cabbin, so
enraged with the treatment he had received,
that he ordered the fellow to be brought before
him, that he might have the pleasure of pistoling
him with his own hand; and would certainly 

have satisfied his revenge in this manner, had
not the first lieutenant remonstrated against it,
by observing that in all appearance, the fellow
was not mad but desperate; that he had
been hired by some enemy of the captain to assassinate
him, and therefore ought to be kept in
irons till he could be brought to a court-martial,
which, no doubt, would sift the affair to the bottom,
by which, important discoveries might be
made, and then sentence the criminal to a death
adequate to his demerits. —This suggestion, improbable
as it was, had the desired effect upon
the captain, being exactly calculated for the meridian
of his intellects; more especially, as doctor
Mackshane espoused this opinion, in consequence
of his previous declaration that the man
was not mad. —Morgan finding there was no
more damage done, could not help discovering
by his countenance, the pleasure he enjoyed on
this occasion; and while he bathed the doctor's
face with an embrocation, ventured to ask him,
Whether he thought there were more fools or
madmen on board? But he would have been wiser
in containing this sally, which his patient carefully
laid up in his memory, to be taken notice of
at a more fit season. —Mean while we weighed
anchor, and on our way to the Downs, the madman,
who was treated as a prisoner, took an opportunity,
while the centinel attended him at
the head, to leap over-board, and frustrate the
revenge of the captain. —We staid not long at the
downs, but took the benefit of the first easterly
wind to go round to Spithead; where having received
on board provisions for six months, we
sailed from St. Helens, in the grand fleet bound 

for the West-Indies on the ever memorable expedition
of Carthagena. 
It was not without great mortification, I saw
myself on the point of being transported to such
a distant and unhealthy climate, destitute of every
convenience that could render such a voyage supportable; 
and under the dominion of an arbitrary
tyrant, whose command was almost intolerable: 
However, as these complaints were common
to a great many on board, I resolved to submit patiently
to my fate, and contrive to make myself
as easy as the nature of the case would allow. 
—We got out of the channel with a prosperous
breeze, which died away, leaving us becalmed
about fifty leagues to the westward of the Lizard: 
But this state of inaction did not last long; for
next night our main-top-sail was split by the
wind, which in the morning encreased to a hurricane. 
—I was wakened by a most horrible din,
occasioned by the play of the gun carriages upon
the decks above, the creaking of cabins, the
howling of the wind through the shrouds,
the confused noise of the ship's crew, the pipes
of the boatswain and his mates, the trumpets of
the lieutenants, and the clanking of the chain-pumps. 
—Morgan, who had never been at sea before,
turned out in a great hurry, crying, “Got
have mercy and compassion upon us! I believe
we have got upon the confines of Lucifer and
the d&wblank;ned!”—while poor Thomson lay
quaking in his hammock, putting up petitions to
heaven for our safety. —I got out of bed and
joined the Welchman, with whom (after having
fortified ourselves with brandy) I went above; 
but if my sense of hearing was startled before,
how must my sight be appalled in beholding the 

effects of the storm? The sea was swelled into
billows mountain-high, on the top of which our
ship sometimes hung, as if it was about to
be precipitated to the abyss below! Sometimes
we sunk between two waves that rose on each
side higher than our topmast head, and threatned
by dashing together, to overwhelm us in a moment! 
Of all our fleet, consisting of a hundred and
fifty sail, scarce twelve appeared, and these driving
under their bare poles, at the mercy of the tempest. 
At length the masts of one of them gave
way, and tumbled over-board with a hideous
crash! Nor was the prospect in our own ship
much more agreeable;—a number of officers and
sailors run backward and forward with distraction
in their looks, hollowing to one another, and
unknowing what they should attend to first. 
Some clung to the yards, endeavouring to unbend
the sails that were split into a thousand pieces
flapping in the wind; others tried to furl those
which were yet whole, while the masts, at every
pitch, bent and quivered like twigs, as if they
would have shivered into innumerable splinters! 
—While I considered this scene with equal terror
and astonishment, one of the main-braces
broke, by the shock whereof two sailors were
flung from the yard's arm into the sea, where
they perished, and poor Jack Rattlin thrown
down upon the deck, at the expence of a broken
leg. Morgan and I ran immediately to his assistance,
and found a splinter of the shin-bone thrust
by the violence of the fall through the skin: 
As this was a case of too great consequence to
be treated without the authority of the doctor,
I went down to his cabin, to inform him of the
accident, as well as to bring up dressings, which 

we always kept ready prepared. —I entered his
apartment without any ceremony, and by the
glimmering of a lamp, perceived him on his knees,
before something that very much resembled a
crucifix; but this I will not insist upon, that I
may not seem too much a slave to common report,
which indeed assisted my conjecture on this
occasion, by representing doctor Mackshane as a
member of the church of Rome. —Be this as it
will, he got up in a sort of confusion, occasioned
(I suppose) by his being disturbed in his devotion,
and in a trice, snatched the object of my suspicion
from my sight. —After making an apology for
my intrusion, I acquainted him with the situation
of Rattlin, but could by no means prevail upon
him to visit him on deck where he lay; he
bid me desire the boatswain to order some of the
men to carry him down to the cockpit, and in the
mean time he would direct Thomson in getting
ready the dressings. —When I signified to the
boatswain the doctor's desire, he swore a terrible
oath, that he could not spare one man from the
deck, because he expected the masts would go by
the board every minute. —This piece of information
did not at all contribute to my peace of
mind; however, as my friend Rattlin complained
very much, with the assistance of Morgan, I
supported him to the lower deck, whither Mr.
Mackshane, after much intreaty, ventured to
come, attended by Thomson with a boxful of
dressings, and his own servant, who carried a
whole set of capital instruments. —He examined
the fracture and the wound, and concluding from
a livid colour extending itself upon the limb, that
a mortification would ensue, resolved to amputate
the leg immediately. —This was a dreadful sentence 

to the patient, who recruiting himself with
a quid of tobacco, pronounced with a woful
countenance, “What! is there no remedy,
doctor? must I be dock'd? can't you splice
it?” —“Assuredly, doctor Mackshane (said
the first mate) with submission, and deference,
and veneration to your superior abilities, and
opportunities, and stations (look you) I do
apprehend, and conjecture, and aver, that there
is no occasion nor necessity to smite off this
poor man's leg.” —“God almighty bless you,
dear Welchman! (cried Rattlin) may you
have fair wind and weather wheresoever you're
bound, and come to an anchor in the road of
heaven at last.” —Mackshane, very much incensed
at his mate's differing in opinion from him
so openly, answered, that he was not bound to
give an account of his practice to him; and in a
peremptory tone, ordered him to apply the tourniquet. 
—At the sight of which, Jack starting
up, cried, “Avast, avast! d&wblank;n my heart, if
you clap your nippers on me, till I know
wherefore! —Mr. Random, won't you lend a
hand towards saving of my precious limb? 
Odd's heart, if lieutenant Bowling was here,
he would not suffer Jack Rattlin's leg to be
be chopped off like a piece of old junk.” — 
This pathetic address to me, joined to my inclination
to serve my honest friend, and the reasons I
had to believe there was no danger in delaying
the amputation, induced me to declare myself of
the first mate's opinion, and affirm that the preternatural
colour of the skin, was owing to an
inflammation occasioned by a contusion, and common
in all such cases, without any indication of
an approaching gangrene. Morgan, who had a 

great opinion of my skill, manifestly exulted in
my fellowship, and asked Thomson's sentiments
of the matter, in hopes of strengthening our association
with him too; but he being of a meek
disposition, and either dreading the enmity of the
surgeon, or speaking the dictates of his own
judgment, in a modest manner, espoused the
opinion of Mackshane, who by this time, having
consulted with himself, determined to act in such
a manner, as to screen himself from censure; and
at the same time revenge himself on us, for our
arrogance in contradicting him. —With this view,
he demanded to know if we would undertake to
cure the leg at our peril; that is, be answerable
for the consequence. —To this Morgan replied,
that the lives of his creatures are in the hands
of Got alone; and it would be great presumption
in him to undertake for an event that was in
the power of his maker, no more than the doctor
could promise to cure all the sick to whom
he administered his assistance; but if the patient
would put himself under our direction, we would
do our endeavour to bring his distemper to a favourable
issue, to which, at present, we saw no
obstruction. —I signified my concurrence; and
Rattlin was so over-joyed, that shaking us both
by the hands, he swore no body else should touch
him, and if he died, his blood should be upon
his own head. —Mr. Mackshane, flattering himself
with the prospect of our miscarriage, went
away, and left us to manage it as we should think
proper; accordingly, having sawed off part of
the splinter that stuck through the skin, we reduced
the fracture, dressed the wound, applied
the eighteen-tailed bandage, and put the leg in a
box, secundum artem. —Every thing succeeded according 

to our wish, and we had the satisfaction,
of not only preserving the poor fellow's leg, but
likewise of rendering the doctor contemptible among
the ship's company, who had all their eyes
on us during the course of this cure, which was
compleated in six weeks.
