The Italian marquis and German baron are disgraced; 
the painter is persuaded to accompany
Pickle to a masquerade in woman's apparel; is
engaged in a troublesome adventure, and with
his companion conveyed to the Bastile. 
The painter, at the request of Pickle, who
had a design upon the count's sense of
hearing, favoured the company with the song of
Bumper Squire Jones, which yielded infinite satisfaction
to the baron; but affected the delicate
ears of the Italian in such a manner, that his
features expressed astonishment and disquiet; and
by his sudden and repeated journeys to the door,
it plainly appeared, that he was in the same predicament
with those who, as Shakespear observes,
when the bagpipe sings in the nose, cannot contain
their urine for affection. 
With a view, therefore, of vindicating music
from such a barbarous taste, Mr. Pallet had no
sooner performed his task, than the count honoured
his friends with some favourite airs of his
own country, which he warbled with infinite
grace and expression, though they had not energy
sufficient to engage the attention of the German,
who fell fast asleep upon his couch, and snored so
loud, as to interrupt, and totally annul this ravishing
entertainment; so that they were fain to
have recourse again to the glass, which made
such innovation upon the brain of the physician,
that he sung divers odes of Anacreon to a tune
of his own composing, and held forth upon the
music and recitative of the ancients with great 

erudition; while Pallet, having found means to
make the Italian acquainted with the nature of
his profession, harangued upon painting with
wonderful volubility, in a language which (it was
well for his own credit) the stranger did not understand. 
At length the doctor was seized with such a
qualm, that he begged Peregrine to lead him to
his chamber; and the count, tired with the
eternal babble of the painter, reeled towards the
sleeping baron, whom he viewed with rapture,
repeating from the Il Pastor Fido of Guarini, 

Come assetato infermo
Che bramò lungamenté
Il vietato licor—
—Tal' Io! gran tempo infermo,
E d'amorosa sete arso, e consunto.
Then boldly ravished a kiss, and began to tickle
him under the ribs, with such expressions of tenderness,
as scandalized the virtuous painter, who,
conscious of his own attractions, was alarmed
for his person, and staggered in great hurry and
discomposure into the next room, where he put
himself under the protection of our hero, to
whom he imparted his suspicion of the count's
morals, by describing the indecency of his deportment. 
Peregrine, who entertained a just detestation
for all such abominable practices, was incensed at
this information; and stepping to the door of the
dining-room where the two strangers were left
together, saw with his own eyes enough to convince
him, that Pallet's complaint was not without
foundation, and that the baron was not averse 

to the addresses of the count. Our young gentleman's
indignation had well nigh prompted him
to rush in, and take immediate vengeance on the
offenders; but, considering that such a precipitate
step might be attended with troublesome
consequences to himself, he resisted the impulse
of his wrath, and tasked his invention with some
method of inflicting upon them a disgrace suited
to the grossness of their ideas. After having revolved
sundry schemes of punishment, and even
consulted Mr. Pipes, who being present at the
discovery, undertook to sew them up in bags,
with a reasonable quantity of ballast in each, and
throw them over the Pont Neuf into the river; 
his imagination could not supply him with an expedient
to his liking, and he was at a loss how
to behave, when the landlady of the house, whom
he knew to be a dame of remarkable vivacity,
chancing to pass, furnished him with a hint, of
which he immediately took the advantage, by
begging she would do him the favour to step into
the next room, and tell the gentlemen, that he
would be with them as soon as the doctor could
be put to bed. 
The lady very graciously undertook the office,
and entering the apartment, was so much offended
and enraged at the mutual endearments of
the two lovers, that instead of delivering the
message with which she had been entrusted, she
set the trumpet of reproach to her mouth, and
seizing the baron's cane, which she found upon
the side-table, belaboured them both with such
eagerness of animosity, that they found themselves
obliged to make a very disorderly retreat,
and were actually driven down stairs, in a most
disgraceful condition, by this exasperated virago, 

who loaded them with just invectives all the way,
publishing their shame, not only to those of her
own family, but likewise to the populace, who
began to crowd about the door, and in all probability
would have espoused her revenge, had not
their lacqueys, who were in waiting, conveyed
the delinquents into the Remise, and carried them
off with great expedition. 
Peregrine was so delighted with the manner of
the chastisement they had undergone, that he
embraced the mistress of the hotel with transport,
for the spirit she had exerted; and being rendered
frolicksome with the wine he had drank, proposed
that he and Pallet should go to a masquerade,
which he recollected was to be given that night. 
The painter did not want curiosity and inclination
to accompany him, but expressed his apprehension
of losing him in the ball; an accident
which could not fail to be very disagreeable, as
he was an utter stranger to the language and the
town. To obviate this objection, the landlady,
who was of their council, advised him to appear
in a woman's dress, which would lay his companion
under the necessity of attending him with
more care, as he could not with decency detach
himself from the lady whom he should introduce:
besides, such a supposed connexion would
hinder the ladies of pleasure from accosting, and
employing their seducing arts upon a person already
engaged. 
Our young gentleman, foreseeing abundance
of diversion in the execution of this project, seconded
the proposal with such importunity and
address, that the painter allowed himself to be
habited in a suit belonging to the landlady, who
also procured for him a mask and domino, while 

Pickle provided himself with a Spanish dress. In
this disguise, which they put on about eleven
o'clock, did they, attended by Pipes, set out in
a Fiacre for the ball-room, into which Pickle led
this supposititious female, to the astonishment of
the whole company, who had never seen such an
uncouth figure in the appearance of a woman. 
After they had taken a view of all the remarkable
masques, and the painter had been
treated with a glass of liqueur, his mischievous
companion gave him the slip, and vanishing in
an instant, returned with another mask and a domino
over his habit, that he might enjoy Pallet's
perplexity, and be at hand to protect him from
insult. 
The poor painter having lost his guide, was
almost distracted with anxiety, and stalked about
the room, in quest of him, with such huge strides
and oddity of gesture, that he was followed by
a whole multitude, who gazed at him as a preternatural
phænomenon. This attendance increased
his uneasiness to such a degree, that he
could not help uttering a soliloquy aloud, in
which he cursed his fate for having depended upon
the promise of such a wag; and swore, that
if once he was clear of this scrape, he would
not bring himself into such a premunire again
for the whole kingdom of France. 
Divers petit maitres understanding the masque
was a foreigner, who in all probability could not
speak French, made up to him in their turns, in
order to display their wit and address, and teized
him with several arch questions; to which he
made no other answer than, “No parly Francy. 
Damn your chattering! Go about your business,
can't ye?” But, what most of all contributed 

to his torture and mortification, was a pressing
call from nature, in consequence of the Champaign
he had so liberally swallowed in the afternoon. 
In the character of a woman, he neither
knew whither to retire, nor, had he known,
durst he run the risk of being discovered, in such a
situation, by the individuals of that sex; and if
he should use the privilege of a man, in his present
appearance, he foresaw that he must subject
himself to the ridicule of the whole company; 
so that he was obliged to suffer the most racking
pangs of retention, and coursed round and round
the whole place, casting many a woeful look
among the crowd in search of Pickle, against
whom he uttered innumerable execrations. At
length, however, he was compelled to yield to
the urgent dictates of necessity, and following several
gentlemen into a small adjoining room furnished
for the occasion, discharged the source of
his vexation in presence of them all, crying in
his own excuse, “By your leave, by your leave. 
Egad! necessity has no law.” The circumstances
of this operation were so extraordinary
and ridiculous, that some of those who were witnesses
of it, held up their hands in token of
amazement; while others ran into the ballroom,
and called their companions to see such
an unheard-of spectacle. 
Among the masques that, upon this intimation,
came to see the painter's attitude, was a
person of great quality, who being a little acquainted
with the English language, waited till
Pallet turned about; and going up to him,
“Madam, (said he) I give you joy of your
happy pisse. It me seem, dat your vatere com
vidout grand pain.” “Yes, thank God, Monsieur, 

(replied the painter) I never was troubled
with the stone.” “Oho! (resumed the masque)
so much de bettre. You love to ave de stone
vidout trouble, if I not mistake.” “Gadzooks!
my dear, you have nicked it to an hair! 
That is the very case, as I hope to be saved,” 
cried Pallet, bursting into a violent fit of laughter; 
which divesting the Frenchman of all ceremony
and reserve, he began to be very free with
the supposed lady, and attempted to plunge his
hand into her bosom: but the painter was too
modest to suffer such indecent treatment; and
when the gallant repeated his efforts in a manner
still more indelicate, lent him such a box on the
ear, as made the lights dance before him, and
created such a suspicion of Pallet's sex, that the
nobleman swore he was either a male or hermaphrodite,
and insisted upon a scrutiny, for the
sake of his own honour, with such obstinacy of
resentment, that the fictitious nymph was in imminent
danger, not only of being exposed, but
also of undergoing severe chastisement, for having
made so free with the prince's ear; when Peregrine,
who saw and over-heard every thing that
passed, thought it was high time to interpose; 
and accordingly, asserted his pretensions to the
insulted lady, who was overjoyed at this proof
of his protection. 
The affronted gallant persevered in demanding
to know who she was, and our hero as strenuously
refused to give him that satisfaction: so that high
words ensued; and the prince threatening to punish
his insolence, the young gentleman, who
was not supposed to know his quality, pointed
to the place where his own sword used to hang,
and snapping his fingers in his face, laid hold on 

the painter's arm, and led him to another part of
the room, leaving his antagonist to the meditations
of his own revenge. 
Pallet having chid his conductor for his barbarous
desertion, made him acquainted with the
difficulty in which he had been involved, and
flatly telling him, he would not put it in his
power to give him the slip again, held fast by his
arm during the remaining part of the entertainment,
to the no small diversion of the company,
whose attention was altogether engrossed in the
contemplation of such an aukward, ungainly
stalking apparition. At last, Pickle being tired
of exhibiting this rareeshew, complied with the
repeated desires of his companion, and handed
her into the coach; which he himself had no
sooner entered, than they were surrounded by a
file of musqueteers, commanded by an exempt,
who ordering the coach-door to be opened, took
his place with great deliberation, while one of his
detachment mounted the box, in order to direct
the driver. 
Peregrine at once conceived the meaning of
this arrest, and it was well for him that he had no
weapon wherewith to stand upon his defence; 
for such was the impetuosity and rashness of his
temper, that had he been armed, he would have
run all risks rather than surrender himself to any
odds whatever; but Pallet imagining that the officer
was some gentleman who had mistaken their
carriage for his own, desired his friend to undeceive
the stranger; and when he was informed of
the real state of their condition, his knees began
to shake, his teeth to chatter, and he uttered a
most doleful lamentation, importing his fear of
being carried to some hideous dungeon of the Bastile, 

where he should spend the rest of his days
in misery and horror, and never see the light of
God's sun, nor the face of a friend; but perish
in a foreign land, far removed from his family and
connexions. Pickle damned him for his pusilanimity,
and the Exempt hearing a lady bemoan
herself so piteously, expressed his mortification at
being the instrument of giving her such pain, and
endeavoured to console them, by representing the
lenity of the French government, and the singular
generosity of the prince, by whose order they
were apprehended. 
Peregrine, whose discretion seemed to forsake
him on all such occasions, exclaimed with great
bitterness against the arbitrary administration of
France, and inveighed with many expressions of
contempt, against the character of the offended
prince, whose resentment, far from being noble,
he said, was pitiful, ungenerous and unjust. To
this remonstrance the officer made no reply, but
shrugged up his shoulders in silent astonishment at
the hardiesse of the prisoner, and the Fiacre was
just on the point of setting out, when they heard
the noise of a scuffle at the back of the coach,
and the voice of Tom Pipes, pronouncing “I'll
be damn'd if I do.” This trusty attendant had
been desired by one of the guard to descend from
his station in the rear, but as he resolved to share
his master's fate, he took no notice of their intreaties,
until they were seconded by force; and
that he endeavoured to repel with his heel, which
he applied with such energy to the jaws of the
soldier who first came in contact with him, that
they emitted a crashing sound like a dried walnut
between the grinders of a templar in the pit. Exasperated
at this outrage, the other saluted Tom's 

posteriors with his bayonet, which incommoded
him so much, that he could no longer keep his
post, but leaping upon the ground, gave his antagonist
a chuck under the chin, that laid him
upon his back, and then skipping over him with
infinite agility, absconded among the crowd of
coaches, till he saw the guard mount before and
behind upon his master's Fiacre, which no sooner
set forward than he followed at a small distance,
to reconnoitre the place where Peregrine should
be confined. 
After having proceeded slowly through many
windings and turnings to a part of Paris, in which
Pipes was an utter stranger, the coach stopped at
a great gate, with a wicket in the middle, which
being opened at the approach of the carriage, the
prisoners were admitted, and the guard returning
with the Fiacre, Tom determined to watch in
that place all night, that in the morning he might
make such observations, as might be conducive to
the enlargement of his master.
