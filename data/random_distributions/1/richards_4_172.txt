My dearest Lady,
I Have been a little in Disorder, that I have. 
Some few Rubs have happen'd. I hope they
will be happily remov'd. But I am un willing to 

believe all that is said. This is a wicked Town,
though. I wish we were out of it. But I see not
when that will be. I wish Mr. B. would permit
me and my Billy to go into Kent: But I don't care
to leave him behind me, neither; and he is not
inclined to go. Excuse my Brevity, my dearest
Ladyâ€”But I must break off, with only assuring
your Ladyship, that I am, and ever will be, 
Your obliged and grateful
P. B.
