The Author of these
Travels, Mr. Lemuel
Gulliver, is my antient
and intimate Friend; 
there is likewise some Relation between
us by the Mother's Side. 
About three Years ago, Mr. Gulliver
growing weary of the Concourse of 

curious People coming to him at his
House in Redriff, made a small Purchase
of Land, with a convenient
House, near Newark in Nottinghamshire,
his Native Country; where he
now lives retired, yet in good Esteem
among his Neighbours. 
Although Mr. Gulliver was
born in Nottinghamshire, where his Father
dwelt, yet I have heard him say,
his Family came from Oxfordshire; to
confirm which, I have observed in
the Church-Yard at Banbury, in that
County, several Tombs and Monuments
of the Gullivers. 
Before he quitted Redriff, he left
the Custody of the following Papers
in my Hands, with the liberty to 

dispose of them as I should think fit. 
I have carefully perused them three
Times: The Style is very plain and
simple; and the only Fault I find is,
that the Author, after the Manner
of Travellers, is a little too Circumstantial. 
There is an Air of Truth
apparent through the Whole; and
indeed, the Author was so distinguished
for his Veracity, that it became
a sort of Proverb among his
Neighbours at Redriff, when any
one affirm'd a Thing, to say, it was
as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke
it. 
By the Advice of several worthy
Persons, to whom, with the Author's
Permission, I communicated these
Papers, I now venture to send them 

into the World, hoping they may
be at least, for some time, a better
Entertainment to our young Noblemen,
than the common Scribbles of
Politicks and Party. 
This Volume would have been
at least twice as large, if I had not
made bold to strike out innumerable
Passages relating to the Winds
and Tides, as well as to the Variations
and Bearings in the several
Voyages; together with the minute
Descriptions of the Management of
the Ship in Storms, in the Style of
Sailors: Likewise the Account of the
Longitudes and Latitudes; wherein I
have Reason to apprehend that Mr.
Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: 
But I was resolved to fit the Work 

as much as possible to the general Capacity
of Readers. However, if my own
Ignorance in Sea-Affairs shall have
led me to commit some Mistakes, I
alone am answerable for them: And
if any Traveller hath a Curiosity to
see the whole Work at large, as it
came from the Hand of the Author,
I shall be ready to gratify him. 
As for any further Particulars relating
to the Author, the Reader will
receive Satisfaction from the first
Pages of the Book.
