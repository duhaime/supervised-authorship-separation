Mr. Belford, To Miss Howe. 

Thursday Night, Oct. 5. 
I return you, Madam, my most respectful thanks
for your condescending hint, in relation to the pious
wishes of your exalted friend for my thorough reformation. 
I will only say, that it shall be my earnest and unwearied
endeavour to make those generous wishes effectual: 
And I hope for the Divine blessing upon such
my endeavours, or else I know they will be in vain. 
I cannot, Madam, express how much I think myself
obliged to you for your further condescension, in
writing to me so frankly the state of your past and
present mind, in relation to the Single and Matrimonial
Life. If the Lady by whom, as the Executor of
her inimitable Friend, I am thus honoured, has failings,
never were failings so lovely in woman! â€”How
much more lovely, indeed, that the virtues of many of
her Sex! 
I might have ventured into the hands of such a Lady 

the Colonel's original Letter entire. That worthy
gentleman exceedingly admires you; and his caution
was the effect of his politeness only, and of his regard
for you. 
I send you, Madam, a Letter from Lord M. to
myself; and the copies of three others written in consequence
of that. These will acquaint you with Mr.
Lovelace's departure from England, and with other
particulars, which you will be curious to know. 
Be pleased to keep to yourself such of the contents
as your own prudence will suggest to you ought not to
be seen by any-body else. 
I am, Madam, with the profoundest and most grateful
respect, 
Your faithful and obliged humble Servant,
John Belford.
