He is the messenger of happiness to his sister, who
removes the film which had long obstructed his
penetration, with regard to count Fathom. 
As the most endearing affection had always
subsisted between Renaldo and his sister,
he would not one moment deny himself the
pleasure of flying to her embrace, and of being
the glad messenger of her deliverance. Soon,
therefore, as he understood the place of her
retreat, and had obtained a proper order to the
abbess, signed by count Trebasi, he set out post
for Vienna, still accompanied by his faithful
Hibernian, and arriving at the convent, found
the abbess and the whole house so engrossed in
making preparations for the ceremony of giving
the veil next day to a young woman who
had fulfilled the term of her probation, that he 

could not possibly see his sister with that leisure
and satisfaction which he had flattered himself
with enjoying at this meeting; and therefore
he was fain to bridle his impatience for two
days, and keep his credentials until the hurry
should be over, that mademoiselle might have
no intimation of her good fortune, except from
his own mouth. 
In order to fill up this tedious interval, he visited
his friends at court, who were rejoiced to
hear the happy issue of his excursion to Presburg; 
the prince who was his particular patron
desired he would make himself perfectly
easy with regard to the death of count Trebasi,
for he would take care to represent him in such
a light to the empress queen, as would screen
him from any danger or prosecution on that
account. His Highness, moreover, appointed
the following day for performing the promise
he had made of presenting him to that august
princess, and in the mean time prepossessed her
so much in his favour, that when he approached
her presence, and was announced by his noble
introductor, she eyed him with a look of
peculiar complacency, saying, “I am glad to
see you returned to my dominions. Your father
was a gallant officer, who served our house
with equal courage and fidelity; and as I understand
you tread in his foot-steps, you may
depend upon my favour and protection.” 
He was so much overwhelmed with this gracious
reception, that, while he bowed in silence,
the drops of gratitude trickled from his eyes; 
and her imperial majesty was so well pleased with
this manifestation of his heart, that she immediately
gave directions for promoting him to
the command of a troop of horse. —Thus fortune 

seemed willing, and indeed eager, to discharge
the debt she owed him for the different
calamities he had undergone. And as he looked
upon the generous Hebrew to be the sole
source of his success, he did not fail to make
him acquainted with the happy effects of his
recommendation and friendship, and to express,
in the warmest terms, the deep sense he had of
his uncommon benevolence, which, by the bye,
was still greater with regard to Renaldo, than
the reader as yet imagines; for he not only
furnished him with money for his present occasions,
but also gives him an unlimited credit on
a banker in Vienna to whom one of his letters
was directed. 
The ceremony of the nun's admission being
now performed, and the convent restored to
its former quiet, Melvile hasted thither on the
wings of brotherly affection, and presented his
letter to the abbess, who having perused the
contents, by which she learned that the family
disquiets of count Trebasi no longer subsisted,
and that the bearer was the brother of mademoiselle,
she received him with great politeness,
congratulated him on this happy event, and
begging he would excuse her staying with him
in the parlour, on pretence of business, withdrew,
saying, she would immediately send in a
young lady who would console him for her absence. 
In a few minutes he was joined by his
sister, who, expecting nothing less than to see
Renaldo, no sooner distinguished his features,
than she shriek'd aloud with surprize, and would
have sunk upon the floor, had not he supported
her in his embrace. 
Such a sudden apparition of her brother at
any time, or in any place, after their long separation, 

would have strongly affected this sensible
young lady: but to find him so abruptly in
a place where she thought herself buried from
the knowledge of all her relations, occasioned
such commotion in her spirits as had well nigh
endangered her reason: for it was not 'till after
a considerable pause, that she could talk to him
with connexion or coherence. However, as
those transports subsided, they entered into a
more deliberate and agreeable conversation; in
the course of which, he gradually informed her
of what had passed at the castle; and inexpressible
was the pleasure she felt in learning that
her mother was released from captivity, herself
restored to freedom, and her brother to the
possession of his lawful inheritance, by the only
means to which she had always prayed these
blessings might be owing. 
As she had been treated with uncommon
humanity by the abbess, she would not consent
to leave the convent until he should be ready to
set out for Presburg; so that they dined together
with that good lady, and passed the
afternoon in that mutual communication with
which a brother and sister may be supposed to
entertain themselves on such an occasion. She
gave him a detail of the insults and mortifications
she had suffered from the brutality of her
father-in-law, and told him, that her confinement
in this monastry was owing to Trebasi's
having intercepted a letter to her from Renaldo,
signifying his intention to return to the empire,
in order to assert his own right and redress her
grievances. Then turning the discourse upon
the incidents of his peregrinations, she in
a particular manner inquired about that exquisite
beauty who had been the innocent source of 

all his distresses, and upon whose perfections
he had often, in his letters to his sister, expatiated
with expressions of rapture and delight. 
This inquiry in a moment blew up that
scorching flame which had been well nigh stifled
by other necessary avocations. His eyes
gleamed, his cheeks glowed and grew pale alternately,
and his whole frame underwent an
immediate agitation; which being perceived
by mademoiselle, she concluded that some new
calamity was annexed to the name of Monimia,
and dreading to ripe up a wound which she saw
was so ineffectually closed, she for the present
suppressed her curiosity and concern, and industriously
endeavoured to introduce some less
affecting subject of conversation. He saw her
aim, approved of her discretion, and joining her
endeavours, expressed his surprize at her having
omitted to signify the least remembrance of
her old favourite Fathom, whom he had left
in England. He had no sooner pronounced
this name, than she suffered some confusion in
her turn; from which, however, recollecting
herself, “Brother,” said she, “you must endeavour
to forget that wretch, who is altogether
unworthy of retaining the smallest share of
your regard.” 
Astonished, and indeed angry at this expression,
which he considered as the effect of malicious
misrepresentation, he gently chid her for
her credulity in believing the envious aspersion
of some person who repined at the superior
virtue of Fathom, whom he affirmed to be an
honour to the human species. 

“Nothing is more easy,” replied the young
lady, “than to impose upon a person, who,
being himself unconscious of guile, suspects no
deceit. You have been a dupe, dear brother,
not to the finesse of Fathom, but to the sincerity
of your own heart. For my own part, I
assume no honour to my own penetration in
having comprehended the villainy of that impostor,
which was discovered in more than one instance
by accidents I could not possibly foresee.” 
You must know that Teresa, who attended
me from my childhood, and in whose honesty
I reposed such confidence, having disobliged
some of the inferior servants, was so narrowly
watched in all her transactions, as to be at last
detected in the very act of conveying a peice
of plate, which was actually found concealed
among her cloaths. 
You may guess how much I was astonished
when I understood this circumstance; I could
not trust to the evidence of my own senses, and
should have still believed her innocent, in spite
of ocular demonstration, had not she, in the
terrors of being tried for felony, promised to
make a very material discovery to the countess,
provided she would take such measures as would
save her life. 
This request being complied with, she, in my
hearing, opened up such an amazing scene of
iniquity, baseness and ingratitude, which had
been acted by her and Fathom, in order to defraud
the family to which they were so much
indebted, that I could not have believed the
human mind capable of such degeneracy, or
that traitor endowed with such pernicious cunning
and dissimulation, had not her tale been
congruous, consistent and distinct, and fraught 

with circumstances that left no room to doubt
the least article of her confession: on consideration
of which, she was permitted to go into
voluntary exile.” 
She then explained their combination in all
the particulars, as we have already recounted
them in their proper place; and, finally, observed,
that the opinion she had hence conceived
of Fathom's character, was confirmed by
what she had since learned of his perfidious conduct
towards that very nun who had lately taken
the veil. 
Perceiving her brother struck dumb with
astonishment, and gaping with the most eager
attention, she proceeded to relate the incidents
of his double intrigue with the jeweller's wife
and daughter, as they were communicated to
her by the nun, who was no other than the individual
Wilhelmina. After those rivals had
been forsaken by their gallant, their mutual
animosities and chagrin served to whet the attention
and invention of each; so that in a little
time the whole mystery stood disclosed to
both. The mother had discovered the daughter's
correspondence with Fathom, as we have
formerly observed, by means of that unfortunate
letter which he unwittingly committed to
the charge of the old beldame; and as soon as
she understood he was without the reach of all
sollicitation or prosecution, imparted this billet
to her husband, whose fury was so ungovernable,
that he had almost sacrificed Wilhelmina
with his own hands, especially when terrified by
his threats and imprecations, she owned that
she had bestowed the chain on this perfidious
lover. However, his dreadful purpose was prevented,
partly by the interposition of his wife, 

whose aim was not the death but immurement
of his daughter, and partly by the tears and supplication
of the young gentlewoman herself,
who protested, that, although the ceremony of
the church had not been performed, she was
contracted to Fathom by the most solemn vows,
to witness which he invoked all the saints in
Heaven. 
The jeweller, upon cooler consideration, was
unwilling to lose the least spark of hope that
glittered among the ruins of his despair, and
resisted all the importunities of his wife, who
pressed him to consult the welfare of his daughter's
soul, in the fond expectation of finding
some expedient to lure back the chain and it's
possessor. In the mean time Wilhelmina was
daily and hourly exposed to the mortifying animadversions
of her mamma, who, with all the
insolence of virtue, incessantly upbraided her
with the backslidings of her vicious life, and
exhorted her to reformation and repentance. 
This continual triumph lasted for many months,
till at length a quarrel happening between the
mother and the gossip at whose house she used
to give the rendezvous to her admirers, that
incensed confidante, in the precipitation of her
anger, promulgated the history of those secret
meetings, and, among the rest, her interviews
with Fathom were brought to light. 
The first people who hear news of this sort,
are generally those to whom they are most
unwelcome. The German was soon apprised
of his wife's frailty, and considered the two
females of his house as a couple of devils incarnate,
sent from hell to exercise his patience:
yet, in the midst of his displeasure, he found
matter of consolation, in being furnished with 

a sufficient reason for parting with his helpmate,
who had for many years kept his family
in disquiet. He therefore, without hazarding
a personal conference, sent proposals to
her by a friend, which she did not think proper
to reject: and seeing himself restored to
the dominion of his own house, exerted his
sway so tyrannically, that Wilhelmina became
weary of her life, and had recourse to the
comforts of religion, of which she soon became
enamoured, and begged her father's permission
to dedicate the rest of her life to the
duties of devotion. She was accordingly received
in this convent; the regulations of
which were so much to her liking, that she
performed the task of probation with pleasure,
and voluntarily excluded herself from
the vanities of this life. It was here she had
contracted an acquaintance with mademoiselle
de Melvile, to whom she communicated her
complaints of Fathom, on the supposition that
he was related to the count, as he himself had
often declared. 
While the young lady rehearsed the particulars
of this detail, Renaldo sustained a strange
vicissitude of different passions. Surprise, sorrow,
fear, hope and indignation raised a most
tumultuous conflict in his bosom. Monimia
rushed upon his imagination in the character
of innocence betrayed by the insinuations of
treachery. He with horror viewed her at the
mercy of a villain, who had broken all the
ties of gratitude and honour. 
Affrighted at the prospect, he started from
his seat, exclaiming in the unconnected strain
of distraction and despair: “Have I then
nourished a serpent in my bosom! Have I 

listened to the voice of a traitor who hath
murdered my peace! who hath tore my heartstrings
asunder, and perhaps ruined the pattern
of all earthly perfection. It cannot be. 
Heaven would not suffer such infernal artifice
to take effect. The thunder would be levelled
against the head of the accursed projector.” 
From this transport, compared with his agitation
when she mentioned Monimia, his sister
judged that Fathom had been the occasion of
a breach between the two lovers; and this
conjecture being confirmed by the disjointed
answers he made to her interrogations upon
the affair, she endeavoured to calm his apprehensions,
by representing that he would soon
have an opportunity of returning to England,
where the mis-understanding might be easily
cleared up; and that, in the mean time, he
had nothing to fear on account of the person
of his mistress, in a country where individuals
were so well protected by the laws and constitution
of the realm. At length he suffered
himself to be flattered with the fond hope of
seeing Monimia's character triumph in the inquiry; 
of retrieving that lost jewel, and of renewing
that ravishing intercourse and exalted
expectation which had been so cruelly cut off. 
He now wished to find Fathom as black as he
had been exhibited, that Monimia's apostacy
might be numbered among the misrepresentations
of his treachery and fraud. 
His love, which was alike generous and ardent,
espoused the cause, and he no longer
doubted her constancy and virtue: but when
he reflected how her tender heart must have
been wrung with anguish at his unkindness 

and cruelty, in leaving her destitute in a foreign
land; how her sensibility must have
been tortured in finding herself altogether dependent
upon a ruffian, who certainly harboured
the most baleful designs upon her honour; 
how her life must be endangered both
by his barbarity and her own despair: I say,
when he reflected on these circumstances, he
shuddered with horror and dismay: and that
very night dispatched a letter to his friend the
Jew, intreating him, in the most pressing
manner, to employ all his intelligence in learning
the situation of the fair orphan, that she
might be protected from the villainy of Fathom,
until his return to England.
