XXXV.Lovelace, To Belford. Pities Tomlinson. Finds that he is

drawn out for himself. In his manner gives Belford some further

of Miss Howe in relation to Mr. Hickman. Weakness of
such as are afraid of making their Last Wills.

character of her beloved friend at large; and an account of the particular
distribution of her time in the twenty-four hours of the natural
day.
L.Lovelace, To Belford, from Paris. Conscience the conqueror of

souls. He cannot run away from his reflections. Alterations in his
proposed route. He desires a particular account of all that has passed
since he left England.
LI.Belford, To Lovelace. Answers him as to all the particulars he
writes about. Wishes he would bend his course towards the Pyrenees,
rather than to the courts he had before visited.
LII.Lovelace, to Belford. Has received a Letter from Joseph Leman
(who, he says, is conscience-ridden) to inform him, that Colonel
Morden resolves to have his will of him. He has hints from
Mowbray to the same effect. He cannot bear to be threatened. He
will write to the Colonel to know his purpose. He requires Belford
fairly to acquaint him with what he knows of it. He cannot get off
his regrets on account of the dear Lady for the blood of him.
LIII.Belford, To Lovelace. It would be matter of serious reflection to
him, he says, if that very Leman, who had been his machine, should
be the instrument of his fall. Beseeches him to avoid the Colonel:
And why.
LIV.Lovelace, To Belford. His resentment on believing himself to
be threatened. Has written to the Colonel to know his intention:
But yet in such a manner that he may handsomely avoid taking it
as a challenge; tho' in the like case he owns that he himself should not.
Copy of his Letter to the Colonel.
LV.Lovelace, To Belford. He is now in his way to Trent, in order
to meet Colonel Morden, in pursuance of his Answer to his Letter.
Copy of that Answer; and of his Reply. His reflections on his ingratitude
to the most excellent of women haunt him in all his amusements,
and make him the most miserable of beings. He acquits the
Lady of all tyranny, affectation, and undue reserve: Execrates the
women; who, by the efficacy which his wanton and conceited folly
gave to their instigations have amply, he says, revenged upon him
their own ruin, which they lay at his door. He is sure of victory; 
but will not, if he can help it, out of regard to the memory of Clarissa,
kill the Colonel.
LVI.From the same. Interview with Colonel Morden. To-morrow,
says he, is the day, that will, in all probability, send either one or
two ghosts to attend the Manes of my Clarissa. He doubts not to
give the Colonel his life, or his death; and to be able, by next morning
Eleven, to write all the particulars.
LVII.The Issue of the Duel.
Conclusion.
