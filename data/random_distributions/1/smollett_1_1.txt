You and I, my good friend, have often deliberated
on the difficulty of writing such
a Dedication as might gratify the self complacency
of a patron, without exposing the author
to the ridicule or censure of the public; and I
think we generally agreed that the task was altogether
impracticable —Indeed, this was one
of the few subjects on which we have always
thought in the same manner: for notwithstanding
that deference and regard which we
mutually pay to each other, certain it is, we
have often differed, according to the predominancy
of those different passions, which frequently
warp the opinion, and perplex the understanding
of the most judicious. 

In Dedication as in Poetry, there is no medium:
for, if any one of the human virtues be
omitted in the enumeration of the patron's
good qualities; the whole address is construed
into an affront, and the writer has the mortification
to find his praise prostituted to very
little purpose. 
On the other hand, should he yield to the
transports of gratitude or affection which is
always apt to exaggerate, and produce no more
than the genuine effusions of his heart, the
world will make no allowance for the warmth
of his passion, but ascribe the praise he bestows
to interested views and sordid adulation. 
Sometimes too, dazzled by the tinsel of a
character which he has no opportunity to investigate,
he pours forth the homage of his admiration,
upon some false Mæcenas, whose
future conduct gives the lie to his eulogium,
and involves him in shame and confusion of
face. Such was the fate of a late ingenious * 
author, who was so often put to the blush for
the undeserved incense he had offered, in the
heat of an enthusiastic disposition, misled by
popular applause, that he had resolved to retract
in his last will, all the encomiums which
he had thus prematurely bestowed, and stigmatize 

the unworthy by name: a laudable scheme
of poetical justice, the execution of which was
fatally prevented by untimely death. 
Whatever may have been the fate of other
Dedicators, I, for my own part, sit down to
write this address, without any apprehension of
disgrace or disappointment; because I know
you are too well convinced of my affection
and sincerity to repine at what I shall say touching
your character and conduct: and you will
do me the justice to believe, that this public
distinction is a testimony of my particular friendship
and esteem. 
Not that I am either insensible of your infirmities,
or disposed to conceal them from the
notice of mankind. There are certain foibles
which can only be cured by shame and mortification; 
and whether or not yours be of that
species, I shall have the comfort to think my
best endeavours were used for your reformation. 
Know then, I can despise your pride, while
I honour your integrity; and applaud your
taste, while I am shocked at your ostentation. — 
I have known you trifling, superficial and obstinate
in dispute; meanly jealous and aukwardly
reserved; rash and haughty in your resentments; 
and course and lowly in your connexions. 
—I have blushed at the weakness of 

your conversation, and trembled at the errors
of your conduct. —Yet, as I own you possess
certain good qualities, which over balance these
defects, and distinguish you on this occasion, as
a person for whom I have the most perfect attachment
and esteem, you have no cause to
complain of the indelicacy with which your
faults are reprehended: and as they are chiefly
the excesses of a sanguine disposition and looseness
of thought, impatient of caution or controul; 
you may, thus stimulated, watch over
your own intemperance and infirmity, with redoubled
vigilance and consideration, and for the
future profit by the severity of my reproof. 
These, however, are not the only motives that
induce me to trouble you with this public application. 
I must not only perform my duty
to my friends, but also discharge the debt I owe
to my own interest. We live in a censorious
age; and an author cannot take too much precaution
to anticipate the prejudice, misapprehension
and temerity of malice, ignorance and
presumption. 
I therefore think it incumbent upon me, to
give some previous intimation of the plan
which I have executed in the subsequent performance,
that I may not be condemned upon
partial evidence; and to whom can I with
more propriety appeal in my explanation, than 

to you, who are so well acquainted with all the
senitments and emotions of my breast? 
A Novel is a large diffused picture, comprehending
the characters of life, disposed in different
groupes, and exhibited in various attitudes,
for the purposes of an uniform plan, and
general occurrence, to which every individual
figure is subservient. But this plan cannot
be executed with propriety, probability or success,
without a principal personage to attract
the attention, unite the incidents, unwind the
clue of the labyrinth, and at last close the
scene by virtue of his own importance. 
Almost all the heroes of this kind, who
have hitherto succeeded on the English stage,
are characters of transcendent worth, conducted
through the vicissitudes of fortune, to that
goal of happiness, which ever ought to be the
repose of extraordinary desert. —Yet the
same principle by which we rejoice at the remuneration
of merit, will teach us to relish the
disgrace and discomfiture of vice, which is
always an example of extensive use and influence,
because it leaves a deep impression of terror
upon the minds of those who were not confirmed
in the pursuit of morality and virtue,
and while the balance wavers, enables the right
scale to preponderate. 

In the Drama, which is a more limited field
of invention, the chief personage is often the
object of our detestation and abhorrence; and
we are as well pleased to see the wicked schemes
of a Richard blasted, and the perfidy of a
Maskwell exposed, as to behold a Bevil
happy, and an Edward victorious. 
The impulses of fear, which is the most violent
and interesting of all the passions, remain
longer than any other upon the memory; and for
one that is allured to virtue, by the comtemplation
of that peace and happiness which it bestows,
an hundred are deterred from the practice of
vice, by that infamy and punishment to which it
is liable, from the laws and regulations of mankind. 
Let me not therefore be condemned for having
chosen my principal character from the
purlieus of treachery and fraud, when I declare
my purpose is to set him up as a beacon for
the benefit of the unexperienced and unwary,
who from the perusal of these memoirs, may
learn to avoid the manifold snares with which
they are continually surrounded in the paths
of life; while those who hesitate on the brink
of iniquity, may be terrified from plunging into
that irremedable gulph, by surveying the deplorable
fate of Ferdinand Count Fathom. 

That the mind might not be fatigued, nor
the imagination disgusted by a succession of vitious
objects, I have endeavoured to refresh
the attention with occasional incidents of a
different nature; and raised up a virtuous character,
in opposition to the adventurer, with
a view to amuse the fancy, engage the affection,
and form a striking contrast which might
heighten the expression, and give a Relief to the
moral of the whole. 
If I have not succeeded in my endeavours to
unfold the mysteries of fraud, to instruct the
ignorant, and entertain the vacant; if I have
failed in my attempts to subject folly to ridicule,
and vice to indignation; to rouse the spirit of
mirth, wake the soul of compassion, and
touch the secret springs that move the heart; 
I have at least, adorned virtue with honour and
applause; branded iniquity with reproach and
shame, and carefully avoided every hint of expression
which could give umbrage to the most
delicate reader: circumstances which (whatever
may be my fate with the public) will with
you always operate in favour of, 
Dear Sir,
Your very affectionate
friend and servant,
The AUTHOR.
