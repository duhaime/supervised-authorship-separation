Some sage observations that naturally introduce
our important history. 
Cardinal de Retz very judiciously observes,
that all historians must of necessity
be subject to mistakes, in explaining the motives
of those actions they record, unless they
derive their intelligence from the candid confession
of the person whose character they represent; 
and that, of consequence, every man
of importance ought to write his own memoirs,
provided he has honesty enough to tell the
truth, without suppressing any circumstance,
that may tend to the information of the reader. 
This, however, is a requisite that, I am afraid, 

would be very rarely found among the number
of those who exhibit their own portraits
to the public: indeed, I will venture to say,
that how upright soever a man's intentions may
be, he will, in the performance of such a task,
be sometimes misled by his own phantasy, and
represent objects as they appeared to him, thro'
the mists of prejudice and passion. 
An unconcerned reader, when he peruses
the history of two competitors, who lived two
thousand years ago, or who, perhaps, never
had existence, except in the imagination of the
author, cannot help interesting himself in the
dispute, and espousing one side of the contest,
with all the zeal of a warm adherent. What
wonder then, that we should be heated in our
own concerns; review our actions with the
same self-approbation that they had formerly
acquired, and recommend them to the world
with all the enthusiasm of paternal affection? 
Supposing this to be the case, it was lucky for
the cause of historical truth, that so many pens
have been drawn by writers, who could not be
suspected of such partiality; and that many
great personages, among the antients as well as
moderns, either would not, or could not entertain
the public with their own memoirs. From
this want of inclination or capacity to write, in
our hero himself, the undertaking is now left
to me, of transmitting to posterity, the remarkable
adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom; 
and by that time the reader shall have
glanced over the subsequent sheets, I doubt not
but he will bless God, that the adventurer was
not his own historian. 

This mirrour of modern chivalry was none
of those who owe their dignity to the circumstances
of their birth, and are consecrated from
the cradle for the purposes of greatness, meerly
because they are the accidental children of
wealth. He was heir to no visible patrimony,
unless we reckon a robust constitution, a tolerable
appearance, and an uncommon capacity, as
the advantages of inheritance: if the comparison
obtains in this point of consideration, he
was, as much as any man, indebted to his parents; 
and pity it was, that in the sequel of his
fortune, he never had an opportunity of
manifesting his filial gratitude and regard. 
From this agreeable act of duty to his sire, and
all those tendernesses that are reciprocally enjoyed
betwixt the father and the son, he was
unhappily excluded by a small circumstance; 
at which, however, he was never heard to repine. 
In short, had he been brought forth in
the fabulous ages of the world, the nature of
his origin might have turned to his account; 
he might, like other heroes of antiquity, have
laid claim to divine extraction, without running
the risque of being claimed by any earthly
father; not that his parents had any reason to
disown or renounce their offspring, or that
there was any thing preternatural in the circumstances
of his generation and birth; on the
contrary, he was, from the beginning, a child
of promising parts, and in due course of nature,
ushered into the world, amidst a whole
cloud of witnesses: but, that he was acknowledged
by no mortal sire, solely proceeded from
the uncertainty of his mother, whose affections
were so dissipated among a number of admirers, 

that she could never pitch upon the person
from whose loins our hero sprung. 
Over and above this important doubt, under
which he was begotten, other particularities attended
his birth, and seemed to mark him out
as something uncommon among the sons of
men. He was brought forth in a waggon, and
might be said to be literally a native of two different
countries; for, though he first saw the
light in Holland, he was not born till after the
carriage arrived in Flanders; so that all these
extraordinary circumstances considered, the
task of determining to what government he
naturally owed allegiance, would be at least as
difficult, as that of ascertaining the so much
contested birth-place of Homer. 
Certain it is, the Count's mother was an
Englishwoman, who, after having been five
times a widow in one compaign, was, in the last
year of the renowned Marlborough's command,
numbered among the baggage of the
allied army, which she still accompanied, thro'
pure benevolence of spirit, supplying the ranks
with the refreshing streams of choice geneva,
and accommodating individuals with clean linen,
as the emergency of their occasions required:
Nor was her philanthropy altogether confined
to such ministration: she abounded with “the
milk of human kindness,” which flowed
plentifully among her fellow-creatures; and to
every son of Mars who cultivated her favour,
she liberally dispensed her smiles, in order to
sweeten the toils and dangers of the field. 
And here it will not be amiss to anticipate
the remaks of the reader, who, in the chastity
and excellency of his conception, may possibly 

exclaim, “Good Heaven! will these authors
never reform their imaginations, and lift their
ideas from the obscene objects of low life? 
Must the public be again disgusted with the
grovelling adventures of a waggon? Will no
writer of genius draw his pen in the vindication
of taste, and entertain us with the agreeable
characters, the dignified conversation, the poignant
repartee, in short, the genteel comedy of
the polite world?” 
Have a little patience, gentle, delicate, sublime,
critic; you, I doubt not, are one of those
consummate connoissers, who, in their purifications,
let humour evaporate, while they endeavour
to preserve decorum, and polish wit,
until the edge of it is quite wore off: or, perhaps
of that class, who, in the sapience of
taste, are disgusted with those very flavours,
in the productions of their own country,
which have yielded infinite delectation to their
faculties, when imported from another clime:
and damn an author in despite of all precedent
and prescription; who extol the writings of
Petronius Arbiter, read with rapture the amorous
sallies of Ovid's pen, and chuckle over
the story of Lucian's ass; yet, if a modern
author presumes to relate the progress of a
simple intrigue, are shocked at the indecency
and immorality of the scene: who delight in
following Guzman d' Alfarache, thro' all the
mazes of squalid beggary; who with pleasure
accompany Don Quixote and his squire, in
the lowest paths of fortune; who are diverted
with the adventures of Scarron's ragged
troop of strollers, and highly entertained
with the servile situations of Gil Blas; yet, 

when a character in humble life occasionally
occurs in a performance of our own growth,
exclaim with an air of disgust, “Was ever
any thing so mean! Sure, this writer must
have been very conversant with the lowest scenes
of life:” who, when Swift or Pope represents
a coxcomb in the act of swearing, scruple not
to laugh at the ridiculous execrations; but in
a less reputed author, condemn the use of such
profane expletives: who eagerly explore the
jokes of Rabelais, for amusement, and even
extract humour from the dean's description of
a lady's dressing room: yet, in a production of
these days, unstampt with such venerable
names, will stop their noses with all the signs
of loathing and abhorrence, at a bare mention
of the china chamber-pot: who applaud Catullus,
Juvenal, Persius and Lucan, for their
spirit in lashing the greatest names of antiquity; 
yet, when a British satirist, of this generation,
has courage enough to call in question
the talents of a Pseudo patron, in power, accuse
him of insolence, rancour and scurrility. 
If such you be, courteous reader, I say again,
have a little patience; for your entertainment
we are about to write. Our hero
shall, with all convenient dispatch, be gradually
sublimed, into those splendid connections
of which you are enamoured; and God forbid,
that in the mean time, the nature of his
extraction should turn to his prejudice, in a
land of freedom like this, where individuals
are every day ennobled in consequence of
their own qualifications, without the least retrospective
regard to the rank or merit of their
ancestors. Yes, refined reader, we are hastening 

to that goal of perfection, where satire
dares not shew her face; where nature is castigated,
almost even to still life; where humour
turns changeling, and slavers in an insipid
grin; where wit is volatilized into a meer
vapour; where decency, divested of all substance,
hovers about like a fantastic shadow; 
where the salt of genius, escaping, leaves nothing
but pure and simple phlegm; and the inoffensive
pen for ever drops the mild manna of
soul-sweetning praise.
