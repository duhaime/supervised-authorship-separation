I receive a challenge—the consequences of
it—the quarrel being made up, I am
put in arrest, by the care and affection of
Strap—but immediately released upon explaining
my affair—the behaviour of
Mr. Oregan and his two friends—I
visit Melinda, whom I divert with an account
of the duel—I propose marriage
—she refers the matter to her mother,
of whom I make a solemn demand of her
daughter—the old lady's behaviour— 
I am discarded, resent their disdain. 
When I was ready to go abroad next day,
Strap brought me a letter, directed To
Mr. Random, Esq; Those. —Which, upon
opening, I found contained a challenge, couched
in these very extraordinary terms: 

“SIR,
Whereas, I am informed that you make
love to Miss Melinda Goosetrap, This
is to let you know, that she is under promise
of marriage to me; and that I am at this
present writing, at the back of Montague-house,
with a pair of good pistols in my hand,
and if you will keep your appointment, I
will make your tongue confess (after the 

breath is out of your body) that you do not
deserve her as well as 
“Yours, &c.
Rourk Oregan.” 
I guessed from the stile and subscription of this
billet, that my rival was a true Milesian, and
was not a little uneasy at the contents, especially
that part, where he asserts his right to my
mistress by promise, a circumstance I did not
know how to reconcile to her penetration. — 
However, this was no time for me to decline
the invitation, because the success of my addresses
might in a great measure depend upon
my behaviour in that affair. I therefore
immediately loaded my pistols, and betook myself
in a hackney-coach to the place appointed,
where I found a tall raw-boned man, with a
hard featured countenance, and black bushy
beard, walking by himself, wrapped up in a
shabby great coat, over which his own hair descended
in a leathern queue from his head, that
was covered with a greasy hat trimmed with a
tarnished pointe d'espagne. He no sooner perceived
me advancing, than without any preamble,
he pulled a pistol from his bosom, and presenting
at me, snapt it. Alarmed at this rude salutation,
I made a stand, and before he could adjust his
other piece, fired one of mine at him, without
doing any damage. By this time he was ready
with his second, that flashed in the pan without
going off: Upon which he called, with a
true Tipperary cadence, “Fire away, honey,” 
—and began to hammer his flint with great deliberation. 

—But I was resolved to make use
of the advantage Fortune had given me; and
therefore stept up, without throwing away my
fire, desiring him to ask his life, or prepare for
another world;—but this stout Hibernian refused
to condescend, and complained bitterly of my
having quitted my ground before he could return
my shot; saying I ought to go back to my
station, and let him have an equal chance with
me. —I endeavoured to persuade him that I had
given him a double chance already; and it was
my business to prevent him from enjoying a third; 
—but now, since I had an opportunity. I demanded
a parley, and desired to know his condition,
and reason for calling me to the field,
who, to the best of my remembrance, so far
from having done him any injury, had never before
seen him. —He told me, that he was a gentleman
of fortune, who had spent all he had, and
hearing that Melinda had got ten thousand pounds,
he intended to make himself master of that sum
by espousing her, and was determined, in an honourable
way, to cut the throats of all those
who stood between him and his hopes. —I then
demanded to know the foundation of his hopes; 
and now that I had seen him, being more and
more astonished at the circumstance of the promise,
desired he would explain that mystery: — 
He gave me to understand, that he trusted entirely
to his birth and personal merit; that he had
frequently wrote to Melinda, setting forth his
claim and pretensions, but she was never kind
enough to send an answer, or even to admit him
into her presence; and that the promise he mentioned
in his letter, was made by his friend Mr.
Gaghagan, who assured him, that no woman 

could resist a man of his appearance. —I could
not forbear laughing to excess, at the simplicity
of my rival, who did not seem to relish my
mirth; but began to be very serious: Upon
which I endeavoured to appease him, by giving
him my word and honour, that so far from prejudicing
his addresses to the lady, I would represent
him to her in the most favourable light I
could, with any regard to truth; but he must
not be surprized if she should remain blind to his
deserts, for nothing was more capricious than a
woman's mind, and the affection of that sex was
seldom purchased with virtue alone. —That my
declaration might have the better effect, I took
notice of his dishabille, and professing sorrow at
seeing a gentleman reduced, slipt two guineas into
his hand, at the sight of which, he threw
away his pistols, and hugging me in his arms,
cried, “Arrah, by Jesus, now, you are the best
friend I have met with these seven long years.” 
—When I had suffered some minutes in his embrace,
he quitted me, and picking up his rusty
arms, wished the devil might burn him if ever
he should give me any further trouble about woman-kind. 
The quarrel being thus amicably composed, I
begged leave to look at his pistols, which I found
so crazy and so foul, that, I believe, it was happy
for him neither of them was discharged, for one
of them would certainly have split in the going
off, and he would, in all probability, have lost
his hand in the explosion; but what gave me a
lively idea of the man's character, was to find,
upon examination, that one of them had been
loaded without being primed, and the other
primed without a charge. 

While we walked homeward together, I expressed
a desire of knowing my new friend's
history: and he informed me of his having served
in the German army as a volunteer against the
Turks; that for his behaviour at the siege of
Belgrade, he had been honoured with an ensign's
commission, and afterwards promoted to the
rank of lieutenant, in which station, it was his
misfortune to affront his captain, who challenged
him to the field, and was killed in the duel,
upon which he was obliged to retreat;—that
he had been in England some years solliciting his
friends for provision in the British army; but
being hitherto unsuccessful, he was desired by
Mr. Gaghagan to turn his thoughts to matrimony,
and make his fortune by an advantageous
match; in consequence of which advice, he had
made up to Melinda, and having heard, by means
of an Irish footman in the family, that I was her
chief favourite, had called me out in hopes of
removing by my death, the greatest obstruction
to his desires; but now he was convinced of my
honour and generosity, he swore by the blessed
Virgin, he would think of her no more, if there
was not another woman in the world. —As a
further proof of his veracity, which I did not at
all doubt, he opened an old iron snuff-box, and
pulled out his commission in the imperial army,
and his captain's challenge, which he preserved
as testimonials of his character. —I was so well
convinced of this poor man's honesty and courage,
that I determined to speak in his behalf
to some of my acquaintance, who might recommend
his case to the consideration of those who
could provide for him; and in the mean time to
accommodate him with a few cloaths, by which 

his appearance would be much mended, and himself
enabled to renew his solicitations in person. 
As we walked along, conversing socially together,
we were met by a file of Musqueteers,
and Strap at their head, who no sooner approached,
than with a frantick look, he cried, “Seize
them!—in the name of God! seize them”— 
We were accordingly surrounded, and I put in
arrest by the corporal, who was commanding officer; 
but captain Oregan disengaged himself, and
run with such speed towards Tottenham-court-road,
that he was out of sight in a moment. When my arms
were delivered up, and myself secured, Strap became
a little more composed, and asked pardon
for the liberty he had taken, which he hoped I
would excuse, as it proceeded from his affection: 
He then told me that, suspecting the letter (which
by the bye was brought by the author himself)
contained something extraordinary, he had peeped
through the key-hole, and seen me load my
pistols; upon which he run down to Whitehall,
and applied to the officer on guard, for a party to
put me in arrest, but before he returned, I was
gone in a coach; that he had enquired which
way I went, and having often heard, that duels were
commonly sought at the back of Montague-house,
he conducted the guard to this place, where he
thanked God for having found me safe and sound. 
I let him know, that I forgave his officious concern
for once, but cautioned him in pretty severe
terms, from making me the subject of idle conversation
for the future; then, turning to the
corporal, I thanked him for his care, and gave
hime a crown to drink with his men, assuring
him that the rencontre was over long before he 

came up, and every thing compromised, as he
might have observed by our behaviour; as a farther
proof of which, he would find upon examination,
that one of my pistols had been discharged; 
—but this civil person, without giving
himself or me any further trouble, received the
bounty with a thousand bows and acknowledgments,
and returning the pistols, released me
immediately. 
He was not gone an hundred yards, when my
friend Oregan came up, in order to rescue me,
with two Tatterdemalions whom he had engaged
for that purpose, about the purlieus of St. Giles's: 
One of them was armed with a musket that
wanted a lock, and another with a rusty broadsword; 
but their dress surpassed all description. — 
When he understood I was already free, he
made an apology for his abrupt departure, and
introduced me to his two companions: First, to
counsellor Fitz-clabber, who, he told me, was
then employed in compiling a history of the kings
of Munster, from Irish manuscripts; and then to
his friend Mr. Gaghagan, who was a profound
philosopher and politician, and had projected
many excellent schemes for the good of his
country. —But it seems these literati had been very
ill rewarded for their ingenious labours; for between
them both, there was but one shirt and
half a pair of breeches. —I thanked them very
kindly for their readiness to assist me, and having
offered my service in my turn, wished them a
good-morrow, desiring Oregan to accompany me
to my lodgings, where he was fitted with decent
cloaths from my wardrobe, so much to his satisfaction,
that he swore eternal gratitude and friendship 

to me, and at my request, recounted all
the adventures of his life. 
In the afternoon, I waited on Melinda, who
received me with great kindness and familiarity,
and laughed excessively at my adventure with the
Irishman, to whose wishes she was no stranger,
having more than a dozen letters in her possession,
which he had wrote to her on the subject
of love, and which, for my entertainment, she
submitted to my perusal. —Having made ourselves
merry at the expence of this poor admirer, I seized
the opportunity of her mother's going out of the
room, and introduced my own passion, which I
recommended to her with all the ardour and eloquence
I was master of. —I flattered, sighed,
swore, intreated, and acted a thousand extravagancies,
in hopes of making some impression on
her heart; but she heard every thing I said without
discovering the least emotion; and other
company came in, before she would vouchsafe
one serious reply. —After tea, the cards were
brought in according to custom, and it was my
good fortune to have Melinda for my partner; 
by which means, instead of losing, I came off
with five guineas clear gain. 
I soon became acquainted with a good many
people of fashion, and spent my time in the modish
diversions of the town, such as plays, operas,
masquerades, drums, assemblies and puppet-shews; 
chiefly in company with Melinda, whom
I cultivated with all the eagerness and address
that my prospect could inspire, and my education
afford: I spared neither my person nor my purse,
to gratify her vanity and pride; my rivals were
intimidated, and indeed out-shone; and after
all, I began to fear that the dear creature had not 

a heart to lose. —At last, finding myself unable
to support the expence of this amour much
longer, I was determined to bring the matter to
a crisis; and one evening, while we were tête
a tête, complained of her indifference, described
the tortures of suspence to a love-sick mind, and
pressed her to disclose her sentiments of matrimony
and me, with such earnestness, that she could
not with all her art, shift the subject; but was
obliged to come to an eclaircissement. —She
let me know with a careless air, that she had no
objection to my person, and if I could satisfy her
mother in other particulars, I should not find
her averse to the match; but she was resolved to
do nothing in an affair of such moment'ous concern,
without the advice and consent of her parent. 
—This was not a very agreeable declaration
to me, whose aim had been to win
her inclination first, and then secure my conquest
by a private marriage, to which I flattered
myself she would express no reluctance. 
—That I might not, however, desert my cause
before it was desperate, I waited on the mother,
and with great formality demanded the daughter
in marriage: The good lady, who was a very
notable woman, behaved with great state and
civility; thanked me for the honour I intended
her family, and said, she did not doubt
that I was in all respects qualified to make
a woman happy; but it concerned her as
a parent anxious about the welfare of her
child, to enquire into the particulars of my
fortune, and know what settlement I proposed
to make. To this intimation, which would have
utterly disconcerted me, if I had not expected
it, I replied without hesitation, that though my 

fortune was very small, I was a gentleman by
birth and education, would maintain her daughter
in the sphere of a gentlewoman, and settle her
own dowry on her and her heirs for ever. — 
This careful matron did not seem to relish my
proposal, but observed with a demure countenance,
that there was no necessity for settling
that upon her child which was her own already: 
However, if I pleased, her lawyer should confer
with mine upon the matter; and in the mean
time, she desired I would favour her with the
perusal of my rent-roll. —Notwithstanding the
vexation I was under, I could scarce forbear
laughing in her face, at the mention of my rent-roll,
which was, indeed, a severe piece of
satire upon my pretensions. I frankly owned I
had no landed estate: and told her, that I could
not exactly specify the sum I was master of, until
I had regulated my affairs, which were at
present in some disorder; but that I would take
an opportunity of satisfying her on that head
very soon. 
It was not long before I took my leave, and
returned to my lodgings in a very melancholy
mood, persuaded that I had nothing more to expect
from that quarter: I was confirmed in this opinion
next day, when I went back with a view
of explaining myself more fully to the old gentlewoman; 
and was told by the footman, that his
ladies were not at home, although I had seen
Melinda through the blinds of a parlour window,
as I went up to the door. Incensed at this
affront I quitted the door, without saying one
word, and as I repassed the parlour, bowed to
Miss, who still remained in the same situation, 

securely screened, as she thought, from my
view. 
This disappointment gave me more uneasiness
on Strap's account, than my own; for I was in
no danger of dying for love of Melinda; on the
contrary, the remembrance of my charming
Narcissa, was a continual check upon my conscience,
during the whole course of my addresses; 
and perhaps contributed to the bad success of
my scheme, by controuling my raptures, and
condemning my design. 
There was a necessity for acquainting my companion
with every thing that happened to me,
and I performed this piece of duty in an affected
passion, swearing I would be his pack-horse no
longer, and desiring him to take the management
of his affairs into his own hand. This finesse
had the desired effect, for instead of grumbling
over my miscarriage, Strap was frightened
at the passion I feigned, and begged me for the
love of God to be appeased; observing, that although
we had suffered a great loss, it was not
irreparable; and if fortune frowned to day, she
might perhaps smile to-morrow. —I pretended to
acquiesce in his remarks, praise his equanimity, and
promise to improve by misfortune. —He, on the
other hand, pretended to be perfectly well satisfied
with my conduct, and conjured me to follow
the dictates of my own reflection; but in spite of
all his affectation, I could perceive his inward affliction,
and his visage sensibly increased in longitude
from that day.
