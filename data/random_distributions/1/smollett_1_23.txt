He arrives at Paris, and is pleased with his
reception. 
He was not so smitten with the delightful
situation of this ancient town, but that he
abandoned it as soon as he could procure a
post-chaise, in which he arrived at Paris, without
having been exposed to any other troublesome
adventure upon the road. He took
lodgings at a certain hotel in the Foxbourg de
St. Germain, which is the general rendezvous of
all the strangers that resort to this capital; and
now sincerely congratulated himself upon his
happy escape from his Hungarian connections,
and from the snares of the banditti; as well as
upon the spoils of the dead body, and his arrival
at Paris, from whence there was such a
short conveyance to England, whither he was
attracted by far other motives than that of
filial veneration for his native soil. 
He suppressed all his letters of recommendation,
which he justly concluded, would subject
him to a tedious course of attendance upon the 

great, and lay him under the necessity of solliciting
preferment in the army, than which
nothing was farther from his inclination; and
resolved to make his appearance in the character
of a private gentleman, which would
supply him with opportunities of examining
the different scenes of life in such a gay metropolis,
so as that he should be able to chuse
that sphere in which he could move the most
effectually to his own advantage. He accordingly
hired an occasional domestic, and under
the denomination of Count Fadome, which he
had retained since his elopement from Renaldo,
repaired to dinner at an ordinary, to which
he was directed as a reputable place frequented
by fashionable strangers of all nations. 
He found this piece of information perfectly
just; for he no sooner entered the apartment,
than his ears were saluted with a strange confusion
of sounds, among which he at once
distinguished the high and low Dutch, barbarous
French, Italian and English languages. 
He was rejoiced at this occasion of displaying
his own qualifications; took his place at one
of three long tables, betwixt a Westphalian
count, and a Bolognian-marquis, insinuated
himself into the conversation with his usual
address, and in less than half an hour, found
means to accost a native of each different country,
in his own mother tongue. 
Such extensive knowledge did not pass unobserved. 
A French abbé, in a provincial dialect,
complimented him upon his retaining
that purity in pronounciation, which is not to
be found in the speech of a Parisian. The
Bolognian mistaking him for a Tuscan, “Sir, 

said he, I presume you are from Florence: I
hope the illustrious house of Lorrain leaves
you gentlemen of that famous city, no room
to regret the loss of your own princes.” The
castle of Versailles becoming the subject of conversation,
monsieur le Comte appealed to him
as to a native German, whether it was not inferior
in point of magnificence to the Chateau
of Grubenhagen: the Dutch officer addressing
himself to Fathom, drank to the prosperity
of Faderland, and asked if he had not once served
in garrison at Schenkenschans; and an
English knight swore with great assurence, that
he had frequently rambled with him at midnight,
among the hundreds of Drury. 
To each person he replied in a polite, tho'
mysterious manner, which did not fail to inhance
their opinion of his good breeding and
importance; and long before the desert appeared,
he was by all the company supposed to be
a personage of great consequence, who for
some substantial reasons, found it convenient to
keep himself incognito. This being the case, it
is not to be doubted that particular civilities
were poured upon him from all quarters: he
perceived their sentiments, and encouraged
them, by behaving with that sort of complaisance,
which seems to be the result of engaging
condescension in a character of superior dignity
and station. His affability was general; 
but his chief attention limited to those gentlemen
already mentioned, who chanced to sit
nearest him at table; and he no sooner gave
them to understand that he was an utter stranger
in Paris, than they unanimously begged to
have the honour of making him acquainted 

with the different curiosities peculiar to that
metropolis. 
He accepted of their hospitality, accompanied
them to a coffee-house in the afternoon,
from whence they repaired to the opera, and
afterwards adjourned to a noted hotel, in order
to spend the remaining part of the evening. 
It was here that our hero secured himself effectually
in the footing he had gained in their
good graces: he in a moment saw through all
the characters of the partie, and adapted himself
to the humour of each individual; without
descending from that elevation of behaviour,
which, he perceived, would operate among
them in his behalf. With the Italian he discoursed
on musick, in the stile of a connoisseur; 
and indeed had a better claim to that
title than the generality of those upon whom
it is usually conferred; for he understood the
art in theory as well as in practice, and would
have made no contemptible figure among the
best performers of the age. 
He harangued upon taste and genius, to the
abbé, who was a wit and critic, ex officio, or
rather ex vestitu: for, a young pert Frenchman,
the very moment he puts on the petit
collet, or little band, looks upon himself as an
inspired son of Apollo; and every one of the
fraternity thinks it incumbent upon him to assert
the divinity of his mission: in a word, the
abbés are a set of people, that bear a strong analogy
to the templars in London. Fools of
each fabric, sharpers of all sorts, and dunces of
every degree, profess themselves of both orders:
the templar is, generally speaking, a prig; so is
the abbé: both are distinguished by an air of 

petulance and self-conceit, which holds a middle
rank betwixt the insolence of a first rate
buck, and the learned pride of a supercilious
pedant. The abbé is supposed to be a younger
brother in quest of preferment in the church:
the temple is considered as a receptacle or seminary
for younger sons, intended for the bar; 
but a great number of each profession turn aside
into other paths of life, long before they
reach these proposed goals: an abbé is often
metamorphosed into a foot soldier; a templar
sometimes sinks into an attorney's clerk: the
gallies of France abound with abbés; and many
templars may be found in our American
plantations; not to mention those who have
made a public exit nearer home. Yet, I would
not have it thought, that my description includes
every individual of those societies. 
Some of the greatest scholars, politicians, and
wits that ever Europe produced, have wore
the habit of an abbé; and many of our most
noble families in England derive their honours
from those who have studied law in the temple; 
the worthy sons of every community shall always
be sacred from my censure and ridicule; 
and while I laugh at the folly of particular
members, I can still honour and revere the institution. 
But, let us return from this comparison,
which some readers may think impertinent
and unseasonable; and observe, that the Westphalian
count, Dutch officer, and English
knight, were not excepted from the particular
regard and attention of our adventurer: he
pledged the German in every bumper; flattered
the Hollander with compliments upon 

the industry, wealth and policy of the Seven
United Provinces; but he reserved his chief
battery for his own countryman, on the supposition
that he was, in all respects, the best
adapted for the purposes of a needy gamester: 
Him, therefore, he cultivated with extraordinary
care, and singular observance; for he
soon perceived him to be an humourist, and
from that circumstance derived an happy presage
of his own success. The baronet's disposition
seemed to be cast in the true English
mould. He was sour, silent and contemptuous; 
his very looks indicated a consciousness
of superior wealth, and he never opened his
mouth, except to make some dry, sarcastic,
national reflection: nor was his behaviour
free from that air of suspicion which a man
puts on, when he believes himself in a croud
of pick-pockets whom his caution and vigilance
set at defiance: in a word, though his tongue
was silent on the subject, his whole demeanour
was continually saying, “You are all a pack
of poor lousy rascals, who have a design
upon my purse: 'tis true, I could buy your
whole generation; but, I wont be bubbled,
d'ye see; I am aware of your flattery, and
upon my guard against all your knavish pranks; 
and I come into your company, for my own
amusement only.” 
Fathom having reconnoitred this peculiarity
of temper, instead of treating him with that
assiduous complaisance, which he received from
the other gentlemen of the party, kept aloof
from him in the conversation, with a remarkable
shyness of distant civility, and seldom
took notice of what he said, except with a 

view to contradict him, or retort some of his
satyrical observations. This he conceived to
be the best method of acquiring his good opinion; 
because the Englishman would naturally
conclude, he was a person who could have
no sinister views upon this fortune, else he
would have chosen quite a different manner of
deportment. Accordingly, the knight seemed
to bite at the hook: he listened to Ferdinand
with uncommon regard; he was even heard
to commend his remarks; and at length drank
to their better acquaintance.
