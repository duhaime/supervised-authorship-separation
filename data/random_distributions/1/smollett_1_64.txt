His return to England, and midnight pilgrimage
to Monimia's tomb. 
He considered the date of that unparalelled
transaction, which agreed with his
conjecture, and from the inquiries he made
concerning the person of the traitor, gathered
reasons sufficient to confirm his suspicion. 
Thus certified, “That is the villain, cried the
Count, whose infernal arts have overwhelmed
me with such misery as heaven itself hath no
remedy to dispel! To revenge my wrongs on
that perfidious miscreant, is one of the chief
reasons for which I deign to drag about an
hateful being. O Don Diego! what is life,
when all its enjoyments are so easily poisoned
by the machinations of such a worm!” So saying,
he smote his breast in all the agony of
woe, and besought the Spaniard to relate the
steps he took in consequence of this disaster. 
The Castilian's cheeks reddened at this information,
which reinforced his own resentment,
and casting up his eyes to heaven, “Sacred
powers! (cried he) let him not perish, before
you bring him within my reach. You
ask, me, noble cavalier, what measures I took
in this abyss of misery. For the first day, I
was tortured with apprehensions for the friendly
Fadini, fearing that he had been robbed and 

murthered for the jewels which he had, perhaps,
too unwarily exposed to sale: but this
terror soon vanished before the true presages
of my fate; when, on the morrow, I found
the whole family in tears and confusion,
and heard my landlord pour forth the most
bitter imprecations against the fugitive, who
had deflowered his daughter, and even robbed
the house. You will ask, which of the passions
of my heart were interested on this occasion; 
they were shame and indignation: all my
grief flowed in another channel: I blushed to
find my judgment deceived: I scorned to complain; 
but in my heart denounced vengeance
against my base betrayer. I silently retired to
my apartment, in order to commune with my
own thoughts. 
I had bore greater calamities, without being
driven to despair: I summoned all my fortitude
to my assistance, and resolved to live in
spite of affliction. Thus determined, I betook
myself, to the house of a general officer, whose
character was fair in the world; and having
obtained admission in consequence of my oriental
appearance; “To a man of honour, said
I, the unfortunate need no introduction: my
habit proclaims me a Persian; this passport
from the States of Holland will confirm that
supposition. I have been robbed of jewels, to
a considerable value, by a wretch whom I favoured
with my confidence; and now, reduced
to extreme indigence, I come to offer myself as
a soldier in the armies of France. I have
health and strength sufficient to discharge that
duty: nor am I unacquainted with a military
life, which was once my glory and occupation. 
I therefore sue for your protection, that I may 

be received, though in the lowest order of them
that serve the king; and that your future favour
may depend upon my behaviour in that
capacity.” 
The general, surprized at my declaration,
surveyed me with uncommon attention; he
perused my certificate, asked divers questions
concerning the art of war, to which I returned
such answers as convinced him that I was not
wholly ignorant in that particular. In short,
I was inlisted as a volunteer in his own regiment,
and soon after promoted to the rank of
a subaltern, and the office of equerry to his
own son, who, at that time, had attained to
the degree of colonel, though his age did not
exceed eighteen years. 
This young man was naturally of a ferocious
disposition, which had been rendered quite untractable
by the pride of birth and fortune, together
with the licence of his education. As
he did not know the respect due to a gentleman,
so he could not possibly pay it to those
who were unfortunately under his command. 
Divers mortifications I sustained with that fortitude
which became a Castilian who lay under
obligations to the father; till at length, laying
aside all decorum, he smote me. Sacred heaven!
he smote Don Diego de Zelos, in presence
of his whole houshold. 
Had my sword been endowed with sensation,
it would of itself have started from the scabbard,
at this indignity offered to its master. I
unsheathed it without deliberation, saying,
“Know, insolent boy, he is a gentleman whom
thou hast thus outraged; and thou hast cancelled
the ties which have hitherto restrained
my indignation.” His servants would have interposed, 

but he commanded them to retire; 
and flushed with that confidence which the impetuosity
of his temper inspired, he drew in
his turn, and attacked me with redoubled rage; 
but his dexterity being very unequal to his
courage, he was soon disarmed and overthrown; 
when pointing my sword to his breast, “In
consideration of thy youth and ignorance, said
I, I spare that life which thou hast forfeited by
thy ungenerous presumption.” 
With these words I put up my weapon, retired
through the midst of his domestics, who
seeing their master safe, did not think proper
to oppose my passage, and mounting my horse,
in less than two hours entered the Austrian
dominions, resolving to proceed as far as Holland,
that I might embark in the first ship for
Spain, in order to wash away, with my own
blood, or that of my enemies, the cruel stain
which hath so long defiled my reputation. 
This was the grievance that still corroded my
heart, and rendered ineffectual the inhuman
sacrifice I had made to my injured honour. 
This was the consideration that incessantly
prompted, and still importunes, me to run every
risque of life and fortune, rather than leave
my fame under such an ignominious aspersion. 
I purpose to obey this internal call. I am apt
to believe it is the voice of heaven; of that
providence which manifested its care by sending
such a generous auxiliary to my aid, when
I was overpowered by banditti, on the very first
day of my expedition.” 
Having in this manner gratified the curiosity
of his deliverer, he expressed a desire of knowing
the quality of him to whom he was so signally
obliged; and Renaldo did not scruple to 

make the Castilian acquainted with his name
and family: he likewise communicated the story
of his unfortunate love, with all the symptoms
of unutterable woe, which drew tears from
the noble-hearted Spaniard, while with a groan
that announced the load which overwhelmed
his soul, “I had a daughter, said he, such as
you describe the peerless Monimia, had heaven
decreed her for the arms of such a lover, I,
who am now the most wretched, should have
been the most happy parent upon earth.” 
Thus did these new friends alternately indulge
their mutual sorrow, and concert measures
for their future operations. Melvile earnestly
sollicited the Castilian to favour him with
his company to England, where, in all probability,
both would enjoy the gloomy satisfaction
of being revenged upon their common betrayer
Fathom; and as a farther inducement, he assured
him, that as soon as he should have accomplished
the melancholy purposes of his voyage,
he would accompany Don Diego to Spain,
and employ his whole interest and fortune in
his service. The Spaniard, thunderstruck at
the extravagant generosity of this proposal,
could scarce believe the evidence of his own senses,
and after some pause, replied, “My duty
would teach me to obey any command you
should think proper to impose; but here my
inclination and interest are so agreeably flattered,
that I should be equally ungrateful and unwise,
in pretending to comply with reluctance.” 
This point being settled, they moved forwards
to Mons, as soon as Don Diego was in a
condition to bear the shock of such a removal; 
and there remaining until his wounds were
perfectly cured, they hired a post-chaise for Ostend, 

embarked in a vessel at that port, reached
the opposite shore of England, after a short and
easy passage, and arrived in London without
having met with any sinister accident on the
road. 
As they approached this capital, Renaldo's
grief seemed to regurgitate with redoubled violence. 
His memory was waked to the most
minute and painful exertion of its faculties; 
his imagination teemed with the most afflicting
images, and his impatience became so ardent,
that never lover panted more eagerly for the
consummation of his wishes, than Melvile for
an opportunity of stretching himself upon the
grave of the lost Monimia. The Castilian was
astonished, as well as affected at the poignancy
of his grief, which, as a proof of his susceptibility
and virtue, endeared him still more to his
affection; and though his own misfortunes had
rendered him very unfit for the office of a comforter,
he endeavoured, by soothing discourse,
to moderate the excess of his friend's affliction. 
Though it was dark when they alighted at
the inn, Melvile ordered a coach to be called,
and being attended by the Spaniard, who would
not be persuaded to quit him upon such an occasion,
he repaired to the house of the generous
Jew, whose rheum distilled very plentifully
at his approach. The count had already acquitted
himself in point of pecuniary obligations
to this benevolent Hebrew; and now, after
having made such acknowledgments as might
be expected from a youth of his disposition, he
begged to know by what channel he had received
that letter, which he had been so kind as to
forward to Vienna. 
Joshua, who was ignorant of the contents of 

that epistle, and saw the young gentleman extremely
moved, would have eluded his enquiry,
by pretending he had forgot the circumstance; 
but when he understood the nature of the case,
which was not explained without the manifestation
of the utmost inquietude, he heartily condoled
the desponding lover, telling him he had
in vain employed all his intelligence about that
unfortunate beauty, in consequence of Melvile's
letter to him on that subject; and then directed
him to the house of that physician, who had
brought the fatal billet which had made him
miserable. 
No sooner did he receive this information,
than he took his leave abruptly, with promise
of returning next day, and hied him to the
lodgings of that gentleman, whom he was lucky
enough to find at home. Being favoured
with a private audience, “When I tell you,
said he, that my name is Renaldo count de Melvile,
you will know me to be the most unfortunate
of men. By that letter, which you committed
to the charge of my worthy friend Joshua,
the fatal veil was removed from my eyes,
which had been so long darkened by the artifices
of incredible deceit, and my own incurable
misery fully presented to my view. If you were
acquainted with the unhappy fair, who hath
fallen a victim to my mistake, you will have
some idea of the insufferable pangs which I now
feel in recollecting her fate. If you have compassion
for these pangs, you will not refuse to
conduct me to the spot where the dear remains
of Monimia are deposited; there let me enjoy
a full banquet of woe; there let me feast that
worm of sorrow that preys upon my heart: for
such entertainment have I revisited this (to me) 

ill-omened isle: for this satisfaction I intrude
upon your condescension at these unseasonable
hours; for to such a degree of impatience is
my affliction whetted, that no slumber shall assail
mine eye-lids, no peace reside within my bosom,
until I shall have adored that earthly shrine
where my Monimia lies! Yet would I know
the circumstances of her fate. Did heaven ordain
no angel to minister to her distress? were
her last moments comfortless? ha! was not she
abandoned to indigence, to insults; left in the
power of that inhuman villain who betrayed us
both! Sacred heaven! why did providence
wink at the triumph of such consummate perfidy?” 
The physician having listened with complacency
to this effusion, replied, “It is my profession,
it is my nature to sympathize with the
afflicted. I am a judge of your feelings, because
I know the value of your loss. I attended the
incomparable Monimia in her last illness, and
am well enough acquainted with her story, to
conclude, that she fell a sacrifice to an unhappy
misunderstanding, effected and fomented by
that traitor who abused your mutual confidence.” 
He then proceeded to inform him of all the
particulars which we have already recorded,
touching the destiny of the beauteous orphan,
and concluded with telling him he was ready
to yield him any other satisfaction which it was
in his power to grant. The circumstances of
the tale had put Renaldo's spirits into such
commotion, that he could utter nothing but interjections
and unconnected words. When
Fathom's behaviour was described, he trembled
with fierce agitation, started from his chair, 

pronouncing, “Monster! fiend! but we shall
one day meet.” 
When he was made acquainted with the benevolence
of the French lady, he exclaimed
“O heaven-born charity and compassion!
sure that must be some spirit of grace sent hither
to mitigate the tortures of life! where shall
I find her, to offer up my thanks and adoration!” 
Having heard the conclusion of the detail,
he embraced the relater, as the kind benefactor
of Monimia, shed a flood of tears in his bosom,
and pressed him to crown the obligation, by
conducting him to the solitary place where now
she rested from all her cares. 
The gentleman perceiving the transports of
his grief were such as could not be opposed,
complied with his request, attended him in the
vehicle, and directed the coachman to drive to
a sequestered field, at some distance from the
city, where stood the church, within whose awful
isle this scene was to be acted. The sexton
being summoned from his bed, produced the
keys, in consequence of a gratification, after
the physician had communed with him apart,
and explained the intention of Renaldo's visit. 
During this pause, the soul of Melvile was
wound up to the highest pitch of enthusiastic
sorrow. The uncommon darkness of the
night, the solemn silence, and lonely situation
of the place, conspired with the occasion of
his coming, and the dismal images of his fancy,
to produce a real rapture of gloomy expectation,
which the whole world would not have
persuaded him to disappoint. The clock struck
twelve, the owl screeched from the ruined
battlement, the door was opened by the sexton,
bho, by the light of a glimmering taper, conducted 

the despairing lover to a dreary isle,
and stamped upon the ground with his foot,
saying, “Here the young lady lies interred.” 
Melvile no sooner received this intimation,
than falling on his knees, and pressing his lips
to the hallowed earth: “Peace, cried he, to
the gentle tenant of this silent habitation.” 
Then turning to the by-standers, with a bloodshot
eye, said, “Leave me to the full enjoyment
of this occasion: my grief is too delicate
to admit the company even of my friends: the
rites to be performed require privacy: adieu
then, here must I pass the night alone.” 
The doctor, alarmed at this declaration,
which he was afraid imported some resolution
fatal to his own life, began to repent of having
been accessary to the visit, attempted to dissuade
him from his purpose, and finding him obstinately
determined, called in the assistance of
the sexton and coachman, and sollicited the aid
of Don Diego, to force Renaldo from the execution
of his design. 
The Castilian, knowing his friend was then
very unfit for common altercation, interposed
in the dispute, saying, “You need not be
afraid that he will obey the dictates of despair:
his religion, his honour will baffle such temptations:
he hath promised to reserve his life
for the occasions of his friend; and he shall
not be disappointed in his present aim.” In order
to corroborate this peremptory address,
which was delivered in the French language, he
unsheathed his sword, and the others retreating
at sight of his weapon, “Count, said he,
enjoy your grief in full transport: I will screen
you from interruption, though at the hazard
of my life; and while you give a loose to sorrow, 

within that ghastly vault, I will watch till
morning in the porch, and meditate upon the
ruin of my own family and peace.” 
He accordingly prevailed upon the physician
to retire, after he had satisfied the sexton,
and ordered the coachman to return by break
of day. 
Renaldo thus left alone, prostrated himself
upon the grave, and poured forth such lamentations
as would have drawn tears from the
most savage hearer. He called aloud upon
Monimia's name, “Are these the nuptial joys
to which our fate hath doomed us? Is this the
fruit of those endearing hopes, that intercourse
divine, that raptured admiration, in which so
many hours insensibly elapsed! where now are
those attractions, to which I yielded up my
captive heart! quenched are those genial eyes
that gladdened each beholder, and shone the
planets of my happiness and peace! cold! cold
and withered are those lips that swelled with
love, and far out-blushed the damask rose!
and ah! for ever silenced is that tongue, whose
eloquence had power to lull the pangs of misery
and care! no more shall my attention be
ravished with the music of that voice, which
used to thrill in soft vibrations to my soul! O
sainted spirit! O unspotted shade of her whom
I adored; of her whose memory I shall still
revere with ever-bleeding sorrow and regret; 
of her whose image will be the last idea that
forsakes this hapless bosom! now art thou
conscious of my integrity and love; now dost
thou behold the anguish that I feel. If the
pure essence of thy nature will permit, wilt thou,
ah! wilt thou indulge this wretched youth
with some kind signal of thy notice, with some 

token of thy approbation? wilt thou assume a
medium of embodied air, in semblance of that
lovely form, which now lies mouldering in this
dreary tomb, and speak the words of peace to
my distempered soul! Return, Monimia! appear,
though but for one short moment, to
my longing eyes! vouchsafe one smile; Renaldo
will be satisfied; Renaldo's heart will be at
rest; his grief no more will overflow its banks,
but glide with equal current to his latest hour! 
Alas! these are the ravings of my delirious sorrow! 
Monimia hears not my complaints; her
soul, sublimed far, far above all sublunary cares,
enjoys that felicity, of which she was debarred
on earth. In vain I stretch these eyes, environed
with darkness undistinguishing and void:
no object meets my view; no sound salutes
mine ear, except the noisy wind that whistles
through these vaulted caves of death.” 
In this kind of exclamation did Renaldo pass
the night, not without a certain species of woful
enjoyment, which the soul is often able to
conjure up from the depths of distress; insomuch,
that when the morning intruded on his
privacy, he could scarce believe it was the light
of day, so fast had fleeted the minutes of his
devotion. 
His heart being thus disburthened, and his
impatience gratified, he became so calm and
composed, that Don Diego was equally pleased
and astonished at the air of serenity with
which he came forth, and embraced him with
warm acknowledgments of his goodness and
attachment: he frankly owned, that his mind
was now more at ease than he had ever found
it, since he first received the fatal intimation of
his loss; that a few such feasts would entirely 

moderate the keen appetite of his sorrow,
which he would afterwards feed with less precipitation. 
He also imparted to the Castilian, the plan
of a monument, which he had designed for
the incomparable Monimia; and Don Diego
was so much struck with the description, that
he solicited his advice in projecting another,
of a different nature, to be erected to the memory
of his own ill-fated wife and daughter,
should he ever be able to re-establish himself in
Spain.
