I had once lost my portmanteau
from behind my chaise, and twice
got out in the rain, and one of the
times up to the knees in dirt, to help
the postilion to tie it on, without being
able to find out what was wanting 
—Nor was it till I got to Montriul,
upon the landlord's asking me
if I wanted not a servant, that it occurred
to me, that that was the very
thing. 
A servant! That I do most sadly,
quoth I —Because, Monsieur, said the
landlord, there is a clever young fellow, 

who would be very proud of the
honour to serve an Englishman —But
why an English one, more than any
other? —They are so generous, said
the landlord —I'll be shot if this is not
a livre out of my pocket, quoth I to
myself, this very night —But they
have wherewithal to be so, Monsieur,
added he, —Set down one livre more
for that, quoth I —It was but last
night, said the landlord, qu'un my
Lord Angleis presentoit un ecu a la fille
de chambre —Tant pis, pour Madlle 
Janatone, said I. 
Now Janatone being the landlord's
daughter, and the landlord
supposing I was young in French,
took the liberty to inform me, I should 

not have said tant pis—but, tant
mieux. Tant mieux, toujours, Monsieur,
said he, when there is any thing to be
got—tant pis, when there is nothing. 
It comes to the same thing, said I. 
Pardonnez moi, said the landlord. 
I cannot take a fitter opportunity
to observe once for all, that tant pis
and tant mieux being two of the great
hinges in French conversation, a stranger
would do well to set himself right
in the use of them, before he gets to
Paris. 
A prompt French Marquis at our
ambassador's table demanded of Mr.
H&wblank;, if he was H&wblank; the poet? 

No, said H&wblank; mildly —Tant pis
replied the Marquis. 
It is H&wblank; the historian, said another 
—Tant mieux, said the Marquis. 
And Mr. H&wblank;, who is a man of
an excellent heart, return'd thanks
for both. 
When the landlord had set me
right in this matter, he called in La
Fleur, which was the name of the
young man he had spoke of—saying
only first, That as for his talents, he
would presume to say nothing —Monsieur
was the best judge what would
suit him; but for the fidelity of La
Fleur, he would stand responsible in
all he was worth. 

The landlord deliver'd this in a
manner which instantly set my mind
to the business I was upon—and La
Fleur, who stood waiting without, in
that breathless expectation which every
son of nature of us have felt in our
turns, came in.
