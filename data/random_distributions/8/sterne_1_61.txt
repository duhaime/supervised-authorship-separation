—Now as the notary's wife
disputed the point with the notary
with too much heat—I wish, said
the notary, throwing down the parchment,
that there was another notary
here only to set down and attest all
this— 
—And what would you do then,
Monsieur? said she, rising hastily up— 
the notary's wife was a little fume of
a woman, and the notary thought it 

well to avoid a hurricane by a mild
reply—I would go, answer'd he, to
bed. —You may go to the devil,
answer'd the notary's wife. 
Now there happening to be but
one bed in the house, the other two
rooms being unfurnish'd, as is the
custom at Paris, and the notary not
caring to lie in the same bed with a
woman who had but that moment
sent him pell-mell to the devil, went
forth with his hat and cane and short
cloak, the night being very windy,
and walk'd out ill at ease towards the
pont neuf. 
Of all the bridges which ever were
built, the whole world who have 

pass'd over the pont neuf, must own,
that it is the noblest—the finest—the
grandest—the lightest—the longest— 
the broadest that ever conjoin'd land
and land together upon the face of
the terraqueous globe— 
By this, it seems, as if the author of
the fragment had not been a Frenchman. 
The worst fault which divines and
the doctors of the Sorbonne can allege
against it, is, that if there is
but a cap full of wind in or about
Paris, 'tis more blasphemously sacre
Dieu'd there than in any other aperture
of the whole city—and with reason, 

good and cogent Messieurs; for it
comes against you without crying
garde d'eau, and with such unpremeditable
puffs, that of the few who
cross it with their hats on, not one in
fifty but hazards two livres and a
half, which is its full worth. 
The poor notary, just as he was
passing by the sentry, instinctively
clapp'd his cane to the side of it, but
in raising it up the point of his cane
catching hold of the loop of the sentinel's
hat hoisted it over the spikes
of the balustrade clear into the
Seine— 

—'Tis an ill wind, said a boatsman,
who catch'd it, which blows no
body any good. 
The sentry being a gascon incontinently
twirl'd up his whiskers, and
levell'd his harquebuss. 
Harquebusses in those days went
off with matches; and an old woman's
paper lanthorn at the end of
the bridge happening to be blown
out, she had borrow'd the sentry's
match to light it—it gave a moment's
time for the gascon's blood to run
cool, and turn the accident better to
his advantage—'Tis an ill wind, said he,
catching off the notary's castor, and 

legitimating the capture with the
boatman's adage. 
The poor notary cross'd the
bridge, and passing along the Rue
de Dauphine into the fauxbourgs of
St. Germain, lamented himself as
he walk'd along in this manner: 
Luckless man! that I am, said
the notary, to be the sport of hurricanes
all my days—to be born to
have the storm of ill language levell'd
against me and my profession
wherever I go—to be forced into
marriage by the thunder of the
church to a tempest of a woman—to
be driven forth out of my house by 

domestic winds, and despoil'd of my
castor by pontific ones—to be here,
bare-headed, in a windy night, at the
mercy of the ebbs and flows of accidents
—where am I to lay my head?— 
miserable man! what wind in the two-and-thirty
points of the whole compass
can blow unto thee, as it does
to the rest of thy fellow creatures,
good! 
As the notary was passing on by a
dark passage, complaining in this
sort, a voice call'd out to a girl, to
bid her run for the next notary—now
the notary being the next, and availing
himself of his situation, walk'd
up the passage to the door, and passing 

through an old sort of a saloon,
was usher'd into a large chamber dismantled
of every thing but a long
military pike—a breast plate—a rusty
old sword, and bandoleer, hung up
equi-distant in four different places
against the wall. 
An old personage, who had heretofore
been a gentleman, and unless decay
of fortune taints the blood along
with it was a gentleman at that time,
lay supporting his head upon his hand
in his bed; a little table with a taper
burning was set close beside it, and
close by the table was placed a chair
—the notary sat him down in it; and
pulling out his ink-horn and a sheet
or two of paper which he had in his 

pocket, he placed them before him,
and dipping his pen in his ink, and
leaning his breast over the table, he
disposed every thing to make the
gentleman's last will and testament. 
Alas! Monsieur le Notaire, said
the gentleman, raising himself up a
little, I have nothing to bequeath
which will pay the expence of bequeathing,
except the history of myself,
which I could not die in peace
unless I left it as a legacy to the
world; the profits arising out of it, I
bequeath to you for the pains of taking
it from me—it is a story so uncommon,
it must be read by all 

mankind—it will make the fortunes
of your house—the notary dipp'd his
pen into his ink-horn—Almighty director
of every event in my life! said
the old gentleman, looking up earnestly
and raising his hands towards
heaven—thou whose hand has led
me on through such a labyrinth of
strange passages down into this scene
of desolation, assist the decaying memory
of an old, infirm, and broken-hearted
man, direct my tongue, by
the spirit of thy eternal truth, that
this stranger may set down naught
but what is written in that Book, from
whose records, said he, clasping his
hands together, I am to be condemn'd
or acquitted!—the notary held up 

the point of his pen betwixt the taper
and his eye— 
—It is a story, Monsieur le Notaire,
said the gentleman, which will
rouse up every affection in nature— 
it will kill the humane, and touch
the heart of cruelty herself with
pity— 
—The notary was inflamed with
a desire to begin, and put his pen
a third time into his ink-horn— 
and the old gentleman turning a
little more towards the notary,
began to dictate his story in these
words— 

—And where is the rest of it,
La Fleur? said I, as he just then enter'd
the room.
