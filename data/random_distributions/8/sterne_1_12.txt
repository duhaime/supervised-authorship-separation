This certainly, fair lady!
said I, raising her hand up
a little lightly as I began, must be
one of Fortune's whimsical doings:
to take two utter strangers by their
hands—of different sexes, and perhaps
from different corners of the
globe, and in one moment place
them together in such a cordial situation,
as Friendship herself could
scarce have atchieved for them, had
she projected it for a month— 

—And your reflection upon it,
shews how much, Monsieur, she has
embarassed you by the adventure.— 
When the situation is, what we
would wish, nothing is so ill-timed as
to hint at the circumstances which
make it so: you thank Fortune, continued
she—you had reason—the
heart knew it, and was satisfied; 
and who but an English philosopher
would have sent notices of it to the
brain to reverse the judgment? 
In saying this, she disengaged her
hand with a look which I thought
a sufficient commentary upon the
text. 

It is a miserable picture which I
am going to give of the weakness of
my heart, by owning, that it suffered
a pain, which worthier occasions
could not have inflicted. —I was
mortified with the loss of her hand,
and the manner in which I had lost
it carried neither oil nor wine to the
wound: I never felt the pain of a
sheepish inferiority so miserably in
my life. 
The triumphs of a true feminine
heart are short upon these discomfitures. 
In a very few seconds she
laid her hand upon the cuff of my
coat, in order to finish her reply; so
some way or other, God knows how,
I regained my situation. 

—She had nothing to add. 
I forthwith began to model a different
conversation for the lady,
thinking from the spirit as well as
moral of this, that I had been mistaken
in her character; but upon
turning her face towards me, the
spirit which had animated the reply
was fled—the muscles relaxed, and
I beheld the same unprotected look
of distress which first won me to her
interest—melancholy! to see such
sprightliness the prey of sorrow. —I
pitied her from my soul; and though
it may seem ridiculous enough to a
torpid heart, —I could have taken her
into my arms, and cherished her, 

though it was in the open street,
without blushing. 
The pulsations of the arteries along
my fingers pressing across hers, told
her what was passing within me: she
looked down—a silence of some moments
followed. 
I fear, in this interval, I must
have made some slight efforts towards
a closer compression of her
hand, from a subtle sensation I felt
in the palm of my own—not as if
she was going to withdraw hers— 
but, as if she thought about it— 
and I had infallibly lost it a second
time, had not instinct more than reason
directed me to the last resource 

in these dangers—to hold it loosely,
and in a manner as if I was every
moment going to release it, of myself; 
so she let it continue, till Monsieur
Dessein returned with the key; 
and in the mean time I set myself to
consider how I should undo the ill
impressions which the poor monk's
story, in case he had told it her,
must have planted in her breast
against me.
