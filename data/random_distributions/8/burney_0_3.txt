In the republic of letters, there is no member
of such inferior rank, or who is so much disdained
by his brethren of the quill, as the humble
Novelist: nor is his fate less hard in the world
at large, since, among the whole class of writers,
perhaps not one can be named, of whom the
votaries are more numerous, but less respectable. 
Yet, while in the annals of those few of our
predecessors, to whom this species of writing is
indebted for being saved from contempt, and rescued
from depravity, we can trace such names as
Rousseau, Johnson,*  Marivaux, Fielding, Richardson, 
and Smollet, no man need blush at
starting from the same post, though many, nay,
most men, may sigh at finding themselves distanced. 
The following letters are presented to the
public—for such, by novel writers, novel readers
will be called,—with a very singular mixture
of timidity and confidence, resulting from
the peculiar situation of the editor; who, though
trembling for their success from a consciousness
of their imperfections, yet fears not being involved
in their disgrace, while happily wrapped
up in a mantle of impenetrable obscurity. 
To draw characters from nature, though not
from life, and to mark the manners of the times,
is the attempted plan of the following letters. 
For this purpose, a young female, educated in
the most secluded retirement, makes, at the age
of seventeen, her first appearance upon the great
and busy stage of life; with a virtuous mind,
a cultivated understanding, and a feeling heart,
her ignorance of the forms, and inexperience in
the manners, of the world, occasion all the little
incidents which these volumes record, and which
form the natural progression of the life of a
young woman of obscure birth, but conspicuous
beauty, for the first six months after her Entrance
into the World. 
Perhaps were it possible to effect the total
extirpation of novels, our young ladies in general, 
and boarding-school damsels in particular,
might profit from their annihilation: but since
the distemper they have spread seems incurable,
since their contagion bids defiance to the medicine
of advice or reprehension, and since they are
found to baffle all the mental art of physic, save
what is prescribed by the slow regimen of Time,
and bitter diet of Experience, surely all attempts
to contribute to the number of those which may
be read, if not with advantage, at least without
injury, ought rather to be encouraged than contemned. 
Let me, therefore, prepare for disappointment
those who, in the perusal of these sheets, entertain
the gentle expectation of being transported
to the fantastic regions of Romance, where Fiction
is coloured by all the gay tints of luxurious Imagination,
where Reason is an outcast, and where
the sublimity of the Marvellous rejects all aid
from sober Probability. The heroine of these
memoirs, young, artless, and inexperienced, is 
No faultless Monster, that the World ne'er saw,
but the offspring of Nature, and of Nature in
her simplest attire. 
In all the Arts, the value of copies can only
be proportioned to the scarceness of originals:
among sculptors and painters, a fine statue, or a
beautiful picture, of some great master, may deservedly
employ the imitative talents of younger
and inferior artists, that their appropriation to 
one spot, may not wholly prevent the more general
expansion of their excellence; but, among
authors, the reverse is the case, since the noblest
productions of literature, are almost equally attainable
with the meanest. In books, therefore,
imitation cannot be shunned too sedulously; for
the very perfection of a model which is frequently
seen, serves but more forcibly to mark the inferiority
of a copy. 
To avoid what is common, without adopting
what is unnatural, must limit the ambition of
the vulgar herd of authors: however zealous,
therefore, my veneration of the great writers I
have mentioned, however I may feel myself enlightened
by the knowledge of Johnson, charmed
with the eloquence of Rousseau, softened by the
pathetic powers of Richardson, and exhilarated
by the wit of Fielding, and humour of Smollet; 
I yet presume not to attempt pursuing the
same ground which they have tracked; whence,
though they may have cleared the weeds, they
have also culled the flowers, and though they
have rendered the path plain, they have left it
barren. 
The candour of my readers, I have not
the impertinence to doubt, and to their indulgence,
I am sensible I have no claim: I have, therefore,
only to entreat, that my own words may
not pronounce my condemnation, and that what
I have here ventured to say in regard to imitation,
may be understood, as it is meant, in a general 
sense, and not be imputed to an opinion of
my own originality, which I have not the vanity,
the folly, or the blindness, to entertain. 
Whatever may be the fate of these letters,
the editor is satisfied they will meet with justice; 
and commits them to the press, though
hopeless of fame, yet not regardless of censure.
