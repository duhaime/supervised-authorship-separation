I have not found all the benefit I expected at
Scarborough, where I have been these eight
days —From Harrigate we come hither by the
way of York, where we stayed only one day to
visit the Castle, the Minster, and the Assemblyroom. 
The first, which was heretofore a fortress,
is now converted to a prison, and is the best, in
all respects, I ever saw at home or abroad —It
stands in a high situation, extremely well ventilated; 
and has a spacious area within the walls, for
the health; and convenience of all the prisoners, except
those whom it is necessary to secure in close
confinement —Even these last have all the comforts
that the nature of their situation can admit. 
Here the assizes are held, in a rang; of buildings
erected for that purpose. 
As for the Minster, I know not how to distinguish
it, except by its great size and the height of 

its spire, from those other ancient churches in different
parts of the kingdom, which used to be
called monuments of Gothic architecture; but it
is now agreed, that this stile is Saracen rather than
Gothic; and, I suppose, it was first imported into
England from Spain, great part of which was under
the dominion of the Moors. Those British
architects, who adopted this stile, don't seem to
have considered the propriety of their adoption. 
The climate of the coutry, possessed by the
Moors or Saracens, both in Africa and Spain, was
so exceedingly hot and dry, that those who built
places of worship for the multitude, employed
their talents in contriving edefices that should be
cool; and, for this purpose, nothing could be better
adopted than those buildings; vast, narrow,
dark, and lofty, impervious to the sun-beams,
and having little communication with the scorched
external atmosphere; but ever affording a refreshing
coolness, like subterranean cellars in the heats
of summer, or natural caverns in the bowels of
huge mountains. But nothing could be more
preposterous, than to imitate such a mode of architecture
in a country like England, where the
climate is cold, and the air eternally loaded with
vapours; and where, of consequence, the builder's
intention should be to keep the people dry
and warm —For my part, I never entered the
Abbey church at Bath but once, and the moment
I stept over the threshold, I found myself chilled
to the very marrow of my bones —When we consider,
that in our churches, in general, we breathe
a gross stagnated air, surcharged with damps from
vaults, tombs, and charnel-houses, may we not
term them so many magazines of rheums, created
for the benefit of the medical faculty? and safety
aver, that more bodies are lost, than souls saved,
by going to church, in the winter especially, 

which may be said to engross eight months in the
year. I should be glad to know, what offence it
would give to tender consciences, if the house of
God was made more comfortable, or less dangerous
to the health of valetudinarians; and whether
it would not be an encouragement to piety,
as well as the salvation of many lives, if the place
of worship was well floored, wainscotted, warmed,
and ventilated, and its area kept sacred from the
pollution of the dead. The practice of burying
in churches was the effect of ignorant superstition,
influinced by knavish priests, who pretended that
the devil could have no power over the defunct,
if he was interred in holy ground; and this, indeed,
is the only reason that can be given for consecrating
all cemeteries, even at this day. 
The external appearance of an old cathedral
cannot be but displeasing to the eye of every man
who has any idea of propriety and proportion,
even though he may be ignorant of architecture as
a science; and the long slender spire puts one in
mind of a criminal impaled, with a sharp stake
rising up through his shoulder —These towers, or
steeples, were likewise borrowed from the Mahometans
who, having no bells, used such minarets
for the purpose of calling the people to prayers 
—They may be of further use, however, for
making observations and signals; but I would vote
for their being distinct from the body of the
church, because they serve only to make the pile
more barbarous, or Saracencial. 
There is nothing of this Arabic architecture in
the assembly Room, which seems to me to have
been built upon a design of Palladio, and might
be converted into an elegant place of worship; 
but it is indifferently contrived for that sort of idolatry
which is performed in it at present: the grandeur
of the fane gives a diminutive effect to the 

little painted divinities that are adored in it, and
and company, on a ball night, must look like an
assembly of fantastic fairies, revelling by moonlight
among the columns of a Grecian temple. 
Scarborough seems to be falling off, in point of
reputation —All these places (Bath excepted) have
their vogue, and then the fashion changes —I am
persuaded, there are fifty spaws in England as efficatious
and salutary as that of Scarborough,
though they have not yet risen to fame; and, perhaps,
never will, unless some medical encomiast
should find an interest in displaying their virtues to
the public view —Be that as it may, recourse will
always be had to this place for the convenience of
sea-bathing, while this practise prevails; but it
were to be wished, they would make the beach
more accessible to invalids. 
I have here met with my old acquaintance,
H&wblank;t; whom you have often heard me mention
as one of the most original characters upon earth 
—I first knew him at Venice, and afterwards saw
him in different parts of Italy, where he was well
known by the nick-name of Cavallo Bianco, from
his appearing always mounted on a pale horse,
like Death in the Revelations. You must remember
the account I once gave you of a curious
dispute he had at Constantinople, with a couple of
Turks in defence of the Christian religion; a dispute
from which he acquired the epithet of Demonstrator 
—The truth is, H&wblank; owns no religion
but that of nature; but, on this occasion, he was
stimulated to shew his parts, for the honour of
his country —Some years ago, being in the Campidoglio
at Rome, he made up to the bust of Jupiter,
and, bowing very low, exclaimed in the
Italian language, “I hope, sir, if ever you get
your head above water again, you will remember
that I paid my respects to you in your adversity.” 

This sally was reported to the cardinal
Camerlengo, and by him laid before pope Benedict
XIV. who could not help laughing at the
extravagance of the address, and said to the cardinal,
“Those English heretics think they have
a right to go to the devil in their own way.” 
Indeed H&wblank; was the only Englishman I ever
knew, who had resolution enough to live in his
own way, in the midst of foreigners; for, neither
in dress, diet, customs, or conversation, did he
deviate one title from the manner in which he
had been brought up. About twelve years ago,
he began a Giro or circuit, which he thus performed 
—At Naples, where he fixed his headquarters,
he embarked for Marseilles, from whence
he travelled with a Voiturin to Antibes — 
There he took his passage to Genoa and Lorici; 
from which last place he proceeded, by the way
of Cambratina, to Pisa and Florence —After having
halted some time in this metropolis, he set out
with a Vetturino for Rome, where he reposed
himself a few weeks, and then continued his route
for Naples, in order to wait for the next opportunity
of embarkation —After having twelve times
described this circle, he lately flew off at a tangent
to visit some trees at his country-house in England,
which he had planted above twenty years
ago, after the plan of the double colonade in the
piazza of St. Peter's at Rome —He came hither
to Scarborough, to pay his respects to his noble
friend and former pupil, the M&wblank; of G&wblank;, and,
forgetting that he is now turned of seventy, sacrificed
so liberally to Bacchus, that next day he was
seized with a fit of the opoplexy, which has a
little impaired his memory; but he retains all the
oddity of his character in perfection, and is going
back to Italy, by the way Geneva, that he may
have a conference with his friend Voltaire, about 

giving the last blow to the Christian superstition — 
He intends to take shipping here for Holland or
Hamburgh; for it is a matter of great indifference
to him at what part of the continent he first lands. 
When he was going abraod the last time, he took
his passage in a ship bound for Leghorn, and his
baggage was actually embarked. In going down
the river by water, he was by mistake put on board
of another vessel under sail; and, upon inquiry,
understood she was bound to Petersburgh—“Petersburgh,
—Petersburgh—(said he) I don't
care if I go along with you.” He forthwith
struck a bargain with the captain; bought a couple
of shirts of the mate, and was safe conveyed to
the court of Muscovy, from whence he travelled
by land to receive his baggage at Leghorn —He is
now more likely than ever to execute a whim of
the same nature; and I will hold any wager, that
as he cannot be supposed to live much longer, according
to the course of nature, his exit will be
as odd as his life has been extravagant * . 
But, to return from one humorist to another; 
you must know I have received benefit, both from 

the chalybeate and the sea, and would have used
them longer, had not a most ridiculous adventure, by
making me the town-talk, obliged me to leave
the place; for I can't bear the thoughts of affording
a spectacle to the multitude —Yesterday morning,
at six o'clock, I went down to the bathing-place,
attended by my servant Clinker, who waited
on the beach as usual —The wind blowing from
the north, and the weather being hazy, the water
proved so chill, that when I rose from my first
plunge, I could not help sobbing and bawling out,
from the effects of the cold. Clinker, who heard
me cry, and saw me indistinctly a good way without
the guide, buffetting the waves, took it for granted
I was drowning, and rushing into the sea, cloathes
and all, overturned the guide in his hurry to save
his master. I had swam out a few strokes, when
hearing a noise, I turned about and saw Clinker, already
up to his neck, advancing towards me, with all
the wildness of terror in his aspect —Afraid he
would get out of his depth, I made haste to meet
him, when, all of a sudden, he seized me by one ear,
and dragged me bellowing with pain upon the dry
beach, to the astonishment of all the people, men,
women, and children there assembled. 
I was so exasperated by the pain of my ear, and
the disgrace of being exposed in such an attitude,
that, in the first transport, I struck him down; 
then, running back into the sea, took shelter, in the
machine where my clothes had been deposited. I
soon recollected myself so far as to do justice to the
poor fellow, who, in great simplicity of heart,
had acted from motives of fidelity and affection — 
Opening the door of the machine, which was immediately
drawn on shore, I saw him standing by
the wheel, dropping like a water-work, and trembling
from head to foot; partly from cold, and partly
from the dread of having offended his master  —I 

made my acknowledgements for the blow he had
received, assured him I was not angry, and insisted
upon his going home immediately, to shift his
clothes: a command which he could hardly find
in his heart to execute, so well disposed was he to
furnish the mob with further entertainment at my
expence. Clinker's intention was laudable without
all doubt, but, nevertheless, I am a sufferer
by his simplicity  —I have had a burning-heat, and
a strange buzzing noise in that ear, ever since it
was so roughly treated; and I cannot walk the
street without being pointed at, as the monster that
was hauled naked ashore upon the beach —Well,
I affirm that folly is often more provoking than
knavery, aye and more mischievous too; and whether
a man had not better choose a sensible rogue,
than an honest simpleton for his servant, is no matter
of doubt with 
yours,
Matt. Bramble.
