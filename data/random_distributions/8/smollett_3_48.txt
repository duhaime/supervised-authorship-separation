Mr. Jolter threatens to leave him on account of his
misconduct, which he promises to rectify; but
his resolution is defeated by the impetuosity of his
passions. He meets accidentally with Mrs. Hornbeck,
who elopes with him from her husband,
but is restored by the interposition of the British
embassador. 
Though Mr. Jolter was extremely well
pleased at the safety of his pupil, he could
not forgive him for the terror and anxiety he had
undergone on his account; and roundly told him,
that notwithstanding the inclination and attachment
he had to his person, he would immediately
depart for England, if ever he should hear
of his being involved in such another adventure; 
for it could not be expected that he would sacrifice
his own quiet, to an unrequited regard for
one who seemed determined to keep him in continual
uneasiness and apprehension. 
To this declaration Pickle made answer, that
Mr. Jolter, by this time, ought to be convinced
of the attention he had always paid to his ease
and satisfaction; since he well knew, that he
had ever looked upon him in the light of a friend
rather than as a counsellor or tutor, and desired
his company in France with a view of promoting
his interest, and not for any emolument he could
expect from his instruction. This being the case,
he was at liberty to consult his own inclinations
with regard to going or staying; though he could
not help owning himself obliged by the concern
he expressed for his safety, and would endeavour, 

for his own sake, to avoid giving him any cause
of disturbance in time to come. 
No man was more capable of moralizing upon
Peregrine's misconduct than himself; his reflections
were extremely just and sagacious, and attended
with no other disadvantage, but that of
occurring too late. He projected a thousand salutary
schemes of deportment, but, like other
projectors, he never had interest enough with
the ministry of his passions to bring any one of
them to bear. He had, in the heyday of his gallantry,
received a letter from his friend Gauntlet,
with a kind postscript from his charming
Emilia; but it arrived at a very unseasonable
juncture, when his imagination was engrossed by
conquests that more agreeably flattered his ambition; 
so that he could not find leisure and inclination,
from that day, to honour the correspondence
which he himself had sollicited; and his
vanity had, by this time, disapproved of the engagement
he had contracted in the rawness and
inexperience of youth; suggesting, that he was
born to make such an important figure in life, as
ought to raise his ideas above the consideration of
any such middling connections, and fix his attention
upon objects of the most sublime attraction. 
These dictates of ridiculous pride had almost effaced
the remembrance of his amiable mistress,
or at least so far warped his morals and integrity,
that he actually began to conceive hopes of her
altogether unworthy of his own character and her
deserts. 
Mean while, being destitute of a toy for the
dalliance of his idle hours, he employed several
spies, and almost every day made a tour of the
public places in person, with a view of procuring 

intelligence of Mr. Hornbeck, with whose
wife he longed to have another interview; and
in this course of expectation had he exercised
himself a whole fortnight, when chancing to be
at the hospital of the invalids with a gentleman
lately arrived from England, he no sooner entered
the church than he perceived this lady, attended
by her spouse, who at sight of our hero
changed colour, and looked another way, in order
to discourage any communication between
them. But the young man, who was not so easily
repulsed, advanced with great assurance to
his fellow-traveller, and taking him by the hand,
expressed his satisfaction at this unexpected meeting; 
and kindly upbraiding him for his precipitate
retreat from Chantilly, before Hornbeck
could make any reply, he went up to his wife,
whom he complimented in the same manner, assuring
her with some significant glances, he was
extremely mortified, that she had put it out of
his power to pay his respects to her, on his first
arrival at Paris; and then turning to her husband,
who thought proper to keep close to him in this
conference, begged to know where he could have
the honour of waiting upon him; observing at
the same time, that he himself lived a l'academie
de Palfrenier. 
Mr. Hornbeck, without making an apology
for his elopement on the road, thanked Mr.
Pickle for his complaisance in a very cool and
disobliging manner; saying, that as he intended
to shift his lodgings in a day or two, he could not
expect the pleasure of seeing him, until he should
be settled, when he would call at the academy,
and conduct him to his new habitation. 

Pickle, who was not unacquainted with the
sentiments of this jealous gentleman, did not put
much confidence in his promise, and therefore
made divers efforts to enjoy a little private conversation
with his wife; but he was baffled in all
his attempts by the indefatigable vigilance of her
keeper, and reaped no other immediate pleasure
from this accidental meeting, than that of a kind
squeeze while he handed her into the coach. 
However, as he had been witness to some instances
of her invention, and was no stranger to
the favourable disposition of her heart, he entertained
some faint hopes of profiting by her understanding,
and was not deceived in his expectation; 
for the very next forenoon a Savoyard
called at the academy, and put the following
billet in his hand: 

Coind Sur,
Heaving the playsure of meating with you
at the ofspital of anvilheads, I take this
lubbertea of latin you know, that I lotch at the
hottail de May cong dangle rouy Doghouseten, with
two postis at the gait, naytheir of um vary hole,
ware I shall be at the windore, if in kais you
will be so good as to pass that way at sicks a
cloak in the heavening, when Mr. Hornbeck
goes to the Calfhay de Contea. Prey for the loaf
of Geesus keep this from the nolegs of my hussban,
ells he will make me leed a hell upon urth. 
Being all from, deer Sur, 
Your most umbell sarvan wile
Deborah Hornbeck. 

Our young gentleman was ravished at the receit
of this elegant epistle, which was directed,
A Monsr Monsr Pickhell, a la Gaddamme de Paul
Freny, and did not fail to obey the summons at
the hour of assignation; when the lady, true to
her appointment, beckoned him up stairs, and
he had the good fortune to be admitted unseen. 
After the first transports of their mutual joy at
meeting, she told him, that her husband had
been very surly and cross ever since the adventure
at Chantilly, which he had not yet digested; 
that he had laid severe injunctions upon her to
avoid all commerce with Pickle, and even threatened
to shut her up in a convent for life, if ever
she should discover the least inclination to renew
that acquaintance; that she had been cooped up
in her chamber since her arrival at Paris, without
being permitted to see the place, or indeed
any company, except that of her landlady, whose
language she did not understand; so that her spirit
being broke, and her health impaired, he was
prevailed upon some days ago to indulge her in a
few airings, during which she had seen the gardens
of the Luxembourg, the Thuilleries and
Palais Royal, though at those times when there
was no company in the walks; and that it was
in one of those excursions she had the happiness
of meeting with him. Finally, she gave him to
understand, that rather than continue longer in
such confinement with the man whom she could
not love, she would instantly give him the slip,
and put herself under the protection of her lover. 
Rash and unthinking as this declaration might
be, the young gentleman was so much of a gallant,
that he would not baulk the lady's inclinations,
and too infatuated by his passion to foresee 

the consequences of such a dangerous step; he
therefore, without hesitation, embraced the proposal,
and the coast being clear, they sallied into
the street, where Peregrine calling a Fiacre, ordered
the coachman to drive them to a tavern:
but knowing it would not be in his power to
conceal her from the search of the lieutenant de
police, if she should remain within the walls of
Paris, he hired a Remise, and carried her that same
evening to Villejuif, about four leagues from
town, where he stayed with her all night; and
having boarded her on a genteel pension, and
settled the Å“conomy of his future visits, returned
next day to his own lodgings. 
While he thus enjoyed his success, her husband
endured the tortures of the damned. When he
returned from the coffee-house, and understood
that his wife had eloped, without being perceived
by any person in the family, he began to rave
and foam at the mouth with rage and jealousy,
and in the fury of distraction, accused the landlady
of being an accomplice in her escape, threatening
to complain of her to the commissaire. 
The woman could not conceive how Mrs. Hornbeck,
who she knew was an utter stranger to the
French language, and kept no sort of company,
could elude the caution of her husband, and find
any refuge in a place where she had no acquaintance,
and began to suspect the lodger's
emotion was no other than an affected passion to
conceal his own practices upon his wife, who had
perhaps fallen a sacrifice to his jealous disposition. 
She therefore spared him the trouble of putting
his menaces in execution, by going to the magistrate
without any further deliberation, and giving
an account of what she knew concerning
this mysterious affair, with certain insinuations 

against Hornbeck's character, which she represented
as peevish and capricious to the last degree. 
While she thus anticipated the purpose of the
plaintiff, her information was interrupted by the
arrival of the party himself, who exhibited his
complaint with such evident marks of perturbation,
anger and impatience, that the commissaire
could easily perceive that he had no share in the
disappearance of his wife; and directed him to
the lieutenant de police, whose province it is to
take cognizance of such occurrences. This gentleman,
who presides over the city of Paris,
having heard the particulars of Hornbeck's misfortune,
asked if he suspected any individual person
as the seducer of his yoke-fellow; and when
he mentioned Peregrine as the object of his suspicion,
granted a warrant and a detachment of
soldiers, to search for and retrieve the fugitive. 
The husband conducted them immediately to
the academy where our hero lodged, and having
rummaged the whole place, to the astonishment
of Mr. Jolter, without finding either his wife or
the supposed ravisher, accompanied them to all
the public houses in the Fauxbourg; which having
examined also without success, he returned
to the magistrate in a state of despair, and obtained
a promise of his making such an effectual
inquiry, that in three days he should have an account
of her, provided she was alive, and within
the walls of Paris. 
Our adventurer, who had foreseen all this disturbance,
was not at all surprized when his governor
told him what had happened; and being
conjured to restore the woman to the right owner,
with many pathetic remonstrances touching the heinous
sin of adultery, the distraction of the unfortunate 

husband, and the danger of incurring the resentment
of an arbitrary government, which, upon
application being made, would not fail of espousing
the cause of the injured; he denied, with great
effrontery, that he had the least concern in the
matter, pretended to resent the deportment of
Hornbeck, whom he threatened to chastise for
his scandalous suspicion, and expressed his displeasure
at the credulity of Jolter, who seemed to
doubt the veracity of his asseveration. 
Notwithstanding this confident behaviour, Jolter
could not help entertaining doubts of his sincerity; 
and visiting the disconsolate swain, begged
he would, for the honour of his country, as well
as for the sake of his own reputation, discontinue
his addresses to the lieutenant de police, and
apply to the British Embassador, who by dint of
friendly admonitions, would certainly prevail upon
Mr. Pickle to do him all the justice in his power,
if he was really the author of the injury he had
sustained. The governor urged this advice with
the appearance of so much sympathy and concern,
promising to co-operate with all his influence in
his behalf, that Hornbeck embraced the proposal,
communicated his purpose to the magistrate, who
commended the resolution as the most decent and
desirable expedient he could use, and then waited
upon his excellency, who readily espoused his
cause, and sending for the young gentleman that
same evening, read him such a lecture in private,
as extorted a confession of the whole affair; not
that he assailed him with sour and supercilious
maxims, or severe rebuke, because he had penetration
enough to discern, that Peregrine's disposition
was impregnable to all such attacks; but
he first of all rallied him upon his intriguing genius, 

then, in an humorous manner, described
the distraction of the poor cuckold, who he owned
was justly punished for the absurdity of his conduct; 
and lastly, upon the supposition, that it
would be no great effort in Pickle to part with
such a conquest, especially after it was for some
time possessed, represented the necessity and expediency
of restoring her, not only out of regard
to his own character, and that of his nation,
but also with a view to his ease, which would in
a little time be very much invaded by such an
incumbrance, that in all probability would involve
him in a thousand difficulties and disgusts. 
Besides, he assured him, that he was already, by
order of the lieutenant de police, surrounded
with spies, who would watch all his motions, and
immediately discover the retreat in which he
had deposited his prize. These arguments, and
the frank familiar manner in which they were
delivered, but above all, the last consideration, induced
the young gentleman to disclose the whole
of his proceedings to the Embassador, and promise
to be governed by his direction, provided
the lady should not suffer for the step she had
taken, but be received by her husband with due
reverence and respect. These stipulations being
agreed to, he undertook to produce her in eight
and forty hours; and taking coach immediately,
drove to the place of her residence, where he
spent a whole day and a night in convincing her
of the impossibility of their enjoying each other
in that manner; and returning to Paris, delivered
her into the hands of the Embassador, who
having assured her, that she might depend upon
his friendship and protection, in case she should
find herself aggrieved by the jealous temper of 

Mr. Hornbeck, restored her to her legitimate
lord, whom he counselled to exempt her from
that restraint which, in all probability, had been
the cause of her elopement, and endeavour to
conciliate her affection by tender and respectful
usage. 
The husband behaved with great humility and
compliance, protesting that his chief study should
be to contrive parties for her pleasure and satisfaction. 
But no sooner did he regain possession
of his stray-sheep, than he locked her up
more closely than ever; and after having revolved
various schemes for her reformation, determined
to board her in a convent, under the
inspection of a prudent abbess, who should superintend
her morals, and recal her to the paths
of virtue, which she had forsaken. With this
view he consulted an English priest of his acquaintance,
who advised him to settle her in a
monastery at Lisle, that she might be as far as
possible from the machinations of her lover; and
gave him a letter of recommendation to the superior
of a certain convent in that place, for
which Mr. Hornbeck set out in a few days with
his troublesome charge.
