Now, my dear Parents, I have but this one
Day, between me and the most solemn Rite
that can be perform'd. My Heart cannot yet shake
off this heavy Weight. Sure I am ingrateful to
God's Goodness, and the Favour of the best of Benefactors! 
—Yet I hope I am not! —For at times,
my Mind is all Exultation, with the Prospect of
what Good to-morrow's happy Solemnity may possibly,
by Leave of my generous Master, put it in
my Power to do. O how shall I find Words to
express, as I ought, my Thankfulness, for all the
Mercies before me!—
