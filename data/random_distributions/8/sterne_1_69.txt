There was nothing from
which I had painted out for
myself so joyous a riot of the affections,
as in this journey in the vintage,
through this part of France; 
but pressing through this gate of sorrow
to it, my sufferings has totally
unfitted me: in every scene of festivity
I saw Maria in the back-ground
of the piece, sitting pensive under
her poplar; and I had got almost to
Lyons before I was able to cast a
shade across her— 

—Dear sensibility! source inexhausted
of all that's precious in our
joys, or costly in our sorrows! thou
chainest thy martyr down upon his bed
of straw—and 'tis thou who lifts him
up to Heaven—eternal fountain of
our feelings!—'tis here I trace thee— 
and this is thy divinity which stirs
within me—not that, in some sad
and sickening moments, “my soul
shrinks back upon herself, and startles
at destruction”—mere pomp of
words!—but that I feel some generous
joys and generous cares beyond myself
—All comes from thee, great,
great Sensorium of the world! which
vibrates, if a hair of our heads but
falls upon the ground, in the remotest 

desert of thy creation. —Touch'd
with thee, Eugenius draws my curtain
when I languish—hears my tale
of symptoms, and blames the weather
for the disorder of his nerves. Thou
giv'st a portion of it sometimes to
the roughest peasant who traverses the
bleakest mountains—he finds the lacerated
lamb of another's flock— 
This moment I behold him leaning
with his head against his crook, with
piteous inclination looking down upon
it—Oh! had I come one moment
sooner!—it bleeds to death—his gentle
heart bleeds with it— 
Peace to thee, generous swain! — 
I see thou walkest off with anguish 

—but thy joys shall balance it—for
happy is thy cottage—and happy is
the sharer of it—and happy are the
lambs which sport about you.
