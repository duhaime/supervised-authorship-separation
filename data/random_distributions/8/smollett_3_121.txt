He performs the last offices to his father, and returns
to London, upon a very interesting design. 
Suits of mourning being provided for himself,
his friends and adherents, and every
other previous measure taken, suitable to the occasion,
his father was interred, in a private manner,
in the parish-church; and his papers being
examined, in presence of many persons of honour
and integrity, invited for that purpose, no
will was found, or any other deed, in favour of
the second son, tho' it appeared by the marriage
settlement, that the widow was intitled to a jointure
of five hundred pounds a year. The rest
of his papers consisted of East-India bonds,
South-sea annuities, mortgages, notes and assignments,
to the amount of fourscore thousand
seven hundred and sixty pounds, exclusive of the
house, plate and furniture, horses, equipage and
cattle, with the garden and park adjacent, to a
very considerable extent. 
This was a sum that even exceeded his expectation,
and could not fail to entertain his
fancy with the most agreeable ideas. He found
himself immediately a man of vast consequence
among his country neighbours, who visited him
with compliments of congratulation, and treated
him with such respect as would have effectually
spoiled any young man of his disposition, who
had not the same advantages of experience as he
had already purchased at a very extravagant
price. Thus shielded with caution, he bore his
prosperity with surprising temperance; every 

body was charmed with his affability and moderation; 
and when he made a circuit round the
gentlemen of the district, in order to repay the
courtesy which he owed, he was caressed by
them with uncommon assiduity, and advised to
offer himself as a candidate for the county, at the
next election, which, they supposed, would soon
happen, because the present member was in a
declining state of health. Nor did his person
and address escape unheeded by the ladies, many
of whom did not scruple to spread their attractions
before him, with a view of captivating such
a valuable prize: nay, such an impression did
this legacy make upon a certain peer, who resided
in this part of the country, that he cultivated
Pickle's acquaintance with great eagerness,
and, without circumlocution, offered to him in
marriage his only daughter, with a very considerable
fortune. 
Our hero expressed himself, upon this occasion,
as became a man of honour, sensibility and
politeness; and frankly gave his lordship to understand,
that his heart was already engaged. 
He was pleased with the opportunity of making
such a sacrifice to his passion for Emilia, which,
by this time, inflamed his thoughts to such a degree
of impatience, that he resolved to depart for
London, with all possible speed; and for that
purpose industriously employed almost every hour
of his time in regulating his domestic affairs. He
paid off all his father's servants, and hired others,
at the recommendation of his sister, who promised
to superintend his houshold in his absence:
he advanced the first half-yearly payment of his
mother's jointure; and as for his brother Gam,
he gave him divers opportunities of acknowledging 

his faults, so as that he might have answered
to his own conscience for taking any step in his
favour; but that young gentleman was not yet
sufficiently humbled by misfortune, and not only
forbore to make any overtures of peace, but also
took all occasions to slander the conduct and revile
the person of our hero, being, in this practice,
comforted and abetted by his righteous
mamma. 
Every thing being thus settled for the present,
the triumvirate set out on their return to town, in
the same manner with that in which they had arrived
in the country, except in this small variation,
that Hatchway's chaise-companion was
now the valet de chambre refitted, instead of
Pipes, who, with another lacquey, attended
them on horseback. When they had performed
two thirds of their way to London, they chanced
to overtake a country squire, on his return from
a visit to one of his neighbours, who had entertained
him with such hospitality, that (as the lieutenant
observed) he rolled himself almost gun wale
to, at every motion of his horse, which
was a fine hunter; and when the chaises pass'd
him at full speed, he set up the sportsman's hollow,
in a voice that sounded like a French horn,
clapping spurs to Sorrel at the same time, in order
to keep up with the pace of the machine. 
Peregrine, who was animated with an uncommon
flow of spirits, ordered his postilion to proceed
more softly; and entered into conversation
with the stranger, touching the make and mettle
of his horse, upon which he descanted with so
much learning, that the squire was astonished at
his knowledge, and so engaged with his manner
of discourse, that, when they approached his 

habitation, he invited the young gentleman and
his company to halt, and drink a bottle of his
ale; and was so pressing in his solicitation, that
they complied with his request. He accordingly
conducted them through a spacious avenue, that
extended as far as the highway, to the gate of a
large chateau, of a most noble and venerable appearance,
which induced them to alight and
view the apartments, contrary to their first intention
of drinking a glass of his October at the
door. 
The rooms were every way suitable to the
magnificence of the outside, and our hero imagined
they had made a tour through the whole
sweep, when the landlord gave him to understand
that they had not yet seen the best apartment
of the house, and immediately led them
into a spacious dining-room, which Peregrine
did not enter without giving manifest signs of uncommon
astonishment. The pannels all round
were covered with portraits, at full length, by
Vandyke; and not one of them appeared without
a ridiculous tye-perriwig, in the style of those
that usually hang over the shops of two-penny
barbers. The strait boots in which the figures
had been originally painted, and the other circumstances
of attitude and drapery, so inconsistent
with this monstrous furniture of the head,
exhibited such a ludicrous appearance, that Pickle's
wonder, in a little time, gave way to his mirth,
and he was seized with a violent fit of laughter,
which had well nigh deprived him of his breath. 
The squire, half pleased and half offended at
this expression of ridicule, “I know (said he)
what makes you laugh so woefully: you think it
strange to zee my vorefathers booted and spurred, 

with huge three-tailed perriwigs on their pates. 
The truth of the matter is this: I could not
abide to zee the pictures of my vamily, with a
parcel of loose hair hanging about their eyes,
like zo many colts; and zo I employed a painter
vellow from Lundon to clap decent perriwigs
upon their skulls, at the rate of vive shillings a
head, and offered him three shillings a-piece to
furnish each with an handzome pair of shoes and
stockings: but the rascal, thinking I must have
'em done at any price, after their heads were
covered, haggled with me for your shillings a
picture; and zo, rather than be imposed upon,
I turned him off, and shall let 'em stand as they
are, 'till zome more reasonable brother of the
brush comes round the country.” 
Pickle commended his resolution, tho', in his
heart, he blessed himself from such a barbarous
Goth; and, after they had dispatched two or
three bottles of his beer, they proceeded on their
journey, and arrived in town about eleven at
night.
