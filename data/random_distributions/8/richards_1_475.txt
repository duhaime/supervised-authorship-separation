Dr. H. To James Harlowe senior, Esq; 

London, Sept. 4. 
Sir,
If I may judge of the hearts of other parents by my
own, I cannot doubt but you will take it well to be
informed, that you have yet an opportunity to save yourself
and family great future regret, by dispatching hither
some one of it, with your last Blessing, and your Lady's,
to the most excellent of her Sex. 
I have some reason to believe, Sir, that she has been
represented to you in a very different light from the
true one. And this it is that induces me to acquaint
you, that I think her, on the best grounds, absolutely
irreproachable in all her conduct which has passed under
my eye, or come to my ear; and that her very misfortunes
are made glorious to her, and honourable to all
that are related to her, by the use she has made of them; 
and by the patience and resignation with which she supports
herself in a painful, lingering, and dispiriting decay; 
and by the greatness of mind with which she views 

her approaching dissolution. And all this from proper
motives; from motives in which a dying Saint might
glory. 
She knows not that I write. I must indeed acknowlege,
that I offered to do so some days ago, and that
very pressingly: Nor did she refuse me from obstinacy
—She seems not to know what that is—But desired
me to forbear for two days only, in hopes that her
newly-arrived Cousin, who, as she heard, was soliciting
for her, would be able to succeed in her favour. 
I hope I shall not be thought an officious man on
this occasion: But if I am, I cannot help it; being
driven to write, by a kind of parental and irresistible
impulse. 
But, Sir, whatever you think fit to do, or permit
to be done, must be speedily done; for she cannot, I
verily think, live a week: And how long of that short
space she may enjoy her admirable intellects to take
comfort in the favours you may think proper to confer
upon her, cannot be said. I am, Sir, 
Your most humble Servant,
R. H.
