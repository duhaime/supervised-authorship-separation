I should not like to have my
enemy take a view of my mind,
when I am going to ask protection
of any man: for which reason I generally
endeavour to protect myself; 
but this going to Monsieur le Duc
de C***** was an act of compulsion
—had it been an act of choice,
I should have done it, I suppose, like
other people. 
How many mean plans of dirty
address, as I went along, did my 

servile heart form! —I deserved the
Bastile for every one of them. 
Then nothing would serve me,
when I got within sight of Versailles,
but putting words and sentences together,
and conceiving attitudes and
tones to wreath myself into Monsieur
le Duc de C******s good graces
—This will do, said I—Just as
well, retorted I again, as a coat
carried up to him by an adventurous
taylor, without taking his measure— 
Fool! continued I—see Monsieur le
Duc's face first—observe what character
is written in it—take notice in
what posture he stands to hear you
—mark the turns and expressions of 

his body and limbs—And for the tone
—the first sound which comes from
his lips will give it you—and from
all these together you'll compound
an address at once upon the spot,
which cannot disgust the Duke—the
ingredients are his own, and most
likely to go down. 
Well! said I, I wish it well over— 
Coward again! as if man to man was
not equal throughout the whole surface
of the globe: and if in the field
—why not face to face in the cabinet
too? And trust me, Yorick, whenever
it is not so, man is false to himself,
and betrays his own succours
ten times where nature does it once. 

Go to the Duc de C***** with the
Bastile in thy looks—my life for it,
thou wilt be sent back to Paris in half
an hour with an escort. 
I believe so, said I—Then I'll go
to the Duke, by heaven! with all the
gaity and debonairness in the world.— 
—And there you are wrong again,
replied I—A heart at ease, Yorick,
flies into no extremes—'tis ever on
its center. —Well! well! cried I, as
the coachman turn'd in at the gates,
I find I shall do very well: and by
the time he had wheel'd round the
court, and brought me up to the
door, I found myself so much the
better for my own lecture, that I 

neither ascended the steps like a
victim to justice, who was to part
with life upon the topmost—nor
did I mount them with a skip and a
couple of strides, as I do when I
fly up, Eliza! to thee to meet it. 
As I enter'd the door of the saloon,
I was met by a person who possibly
might be the maitre d'hotel, but had
more the air of one of the under
secretaries, who told me the Duc de
C***** was busy—I am utterly ignorant,
said I, of the forms of obtaining
an audience, being an absolute
stranger, and what is worse in the present
conjecture of affairs, being an
Englishman too. —He replied, that
did not increase the difficulty. I made 

him a slight bow, and told him, I
had something of importance to say
to Monsieur le Duc. The secretary
look'd towards the stairs, as if he
was about to leave me to carry up
this account to some one—But I
must not mislead you, said I; for
what I have to say is of no manner
of importance to Monsieur le Duc
de C*****, but of great importance
to myself. —C'est une autre affaire,
replied he—Not at all, said I,
to a man of gallantry. —But pray,
good sir, continued I, when can a
stranger hope to have accesse? —In not
less than two hours, said he, looking
at his watch. The number of equipages
in the court-yard seem'd to
justify the calculation, that I could 

have no nearer a prospect—and as
walking backwards and forwards in
the saloon, without a soul to commune
with, was for the time as bad as
being in the Bastile itself, I instantly
went back to my remise, and bid the
coachman drive me to the Cordon
Bleu, which was the nearest hotel. 
I think there is a fatality in it—I
seldom go to the place I set out for.
