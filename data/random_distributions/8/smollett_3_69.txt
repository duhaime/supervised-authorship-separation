Peregrine renews his inquiries about his lost Amanda,
in the course of which he is engaged in an intrigue
with a nun, which produces strange consequences. 
Though this treaty was concluded at
the instances of Peregrine and his governor,
it was impossible that a lasting friendship
could subsist between the two parties, because
they entertained for each other the most perfect
contempt, which, in the course of their communication,
could not fail to minister daily food for
animosity and aversion. 
Our adventurer's next care was to exercise all
his diligence and invention to find his lost Amanda,
who, now that he was detached from Mrs. Hornbeck,
resumed the full possession of his thoughts. 
As she would never tell him her own name, or
that of her mother, his inquiries were directed by
a personal description only; and that, in such a
populous city as Brussels, could tend but very
little to his satisfaction. He not only ordered his
valet de chambre to exert his whole address, in
order to discover the place of her abode, but this
dexterous minister, who was very well acquainted
in that city, retained half a dozen of noted pimps 

for the same purpose, who were directed to employ
their researches for a very handsome young
lady, of the middle stature, with fine black eyes,
and teeth as white as snow, a native of Brussels,
though married to a French gentleman, and lately
arrived from her husband's house on a visit to her
mother, who was dangerously ill. 
Thus instructed, they put themselves in motion,
while the lover in person frequented the
court, the opera, the churches, public walks, and
every place where he thought there was the least
probability of seeing her. The description his
Mercury had given to the understrappers of gallantry,
in a good measure suited several ladies in
town, whom Peregrine found means to see, in
consequence of the reports he had received; but
he could not recognize his dear fellow-traveller
among the number. At last one of his terriers
gave the valet de chambre to understand, that at
the grate of a certain nunnery, he had observed
a beautiful young creature, who resembled the
picture he had drawn, and that upon inquiry, he
found she had not taken the veil; but her mother
being lately dead, had entered as a pensionaire,
until her family-affairs could be adjusted. 
This piece of intelligence was no sooner communicated
to our hero, than he flew in the utmost
impatience to the nunnery, and, without allowing
himself to believe that this boarder could
be any other than the object of his pursuit, desired
the portress to tell the young lady who was
lately admitted, that one of her relations begg'd
to speak with her at the grate. He had not waited
five minutes, when this nymph appeared; and
though he found his expectation disappointed, he
was so struck with the charms of this new figure, 

that his heart throbbed when she approached; 
and after he had asked pardon for the liberty he
had taken, and explained the nature of his mistake,
he could not help telling her, that he
thought himself fortunate in the misinformation
he had received, since it was attended with the
pleasure of seeing such an amiable young lady. 
To this compliment she replied with great spirit
and good humour, that encouraged the youth to
continue the conversation, during which he professed
himself her admirer; and when, for the
sake of decorum, he was obliged to take his leave,
earnestly begg'd he might be allow'd to repeat his
visit: and having obtained this permission, and
the knowledge of her name, returned to his lodgings
in full confidence of bringing this intrigue to
a prosperous issue. 
Nor had the young gentleman in this case overrated
his own success: the lady happened to be
of a very amorous complexion, and her passions
being inflamed rather than mortified, by the restraint
in which she lived, she was captivated by
the person of Peregrine, and his insinuating address
had confirmed his conquest. He did not fail
to be at the grate next day, where he urged his
suit with such irresistible recommendations, that
she confessed a mutual flame, after having observed,
that the circumstances of her situation
would not permit her to protract that acknowledgment
in the usual form. He received this
confession with transport, as the effusion of an
ingenuous mind, that soars above all the little arts
and disguises of the sex; and intreated her to tell
him when or where he should have the happiness
of conversing with her, without the interposition
of these invidious bars. 

She gave him to understand, that as her friends
had put her under the direction of a severe abbess,
it would be impossible for her to go abroad
without the connivance of the portress, and
equally impracticable for him to gain admittance
into the convent, without running a manifest risk
of being discovered, and consequently punished
with the utmost severity. 
When a fair lady was in the case, our adventurer
despised all danger, and spared no expence. 
Thus informed, he studied the disposition of the
old sister who kept the keys; and in her appearance
and conversation, distinguished the implacable
rancour of a woman who had spent her
youth in all the mortification of detested celibacy. 
She bore a most inveterate grudge to all her juniors,
who still remained within the possibility of
enjoying those pleasures from which she was eternally
cut off, and observed all the young men
who appeared at the grate with the most envious
suspicion. Not even the power of all-persuading
gold could tame the spite, or soften the vigilant
asperity of this indomitable maiden. 
Our lover tampered with her in vain; nay,
she threatened to inform the abbess of his sacrilegious
attempt, that he might, for the future,
be excluded from the privilege of speaking to the
nuns: and, for the first time, he found the art
of corruption ineffectual. Baffled in this endeavour,
he conferred with his mistress about some
other means of procuring an unrestricted interview; 
and she, in the fertility of her invention,
proposed, that he should make it his business to
find some woman, who, by her acquaintance in
the convent, would introduce him in a female
dress, as a stranger desirous of seeing the Å“conomy 

of the house. The expedient was wonderfully
relished by the gallant, who had immediate recourse
to the assistance of his valet de chambre,
by whom he was next day made acquainted with
a certain good-natured gentlewoman, who, for
an handsome consideration, undertook the task. 
From this good lady's wardrobe he was accordingly
accommodated with a proper suit, which,
on account of his stature, was pieced for the purpose:
and his mistress being previously prepared
with the knowledge of their intention, he set out
in the afternoon with his conductress, who had
interest enough to obtain his admission, on pretence
of his being an English lady, just arrived
from her own country, and curious to see the menage
and accommodations of a nunnery. Though
the alteration of his dress, and a pair of artificial
eye-brows, screened him from the penetrating
eye of the portress, there was something so remarkably
singular in his make, stature, countenance
and mien, that the sisters gazed upon him
as a prodigy; and he could hear them, as he
passed, asking of each other, with expressions of
astonishment, if all the women in England made
such a strange appearance. 
Having visited the cells and chapel, his charmer
officiously offered her service in conducting the
stranger to the garden; and after having attended
them in walking several turns, invited them to
repose in a small arbour, that stood at one corner,
in the middle of a tuft of trees, which rendered it
impervious to the view. The old gentlewoman
understanding the hint, accompanied the lovers
to the entrance of this grove, where she left
them, on pretence of being still unwearied with
the exercise of her legs; and their mutual raptures 

in this stolen interview began to rise to a very
interesting pitch, when they were alarmed by the
rustling of the leaves behind them; and turning
their eyes towards the place, perceived they were
discovered by a nun, who, either by accident or
design, had concealed herself in the thicket, until,
scandalized by their behaviour, she thought it
high time to signify her presence. 
It is not to be doubted that our hero and his
mistress were grievously disconcerted on this occasion. 
The lady cried she was undone, and had
almost fainted with fear, which was not at all
without foundation, considering that not only
her reputation, but even her life was at stake. 
Peregrine, though he could easily have made his
escape over the garden-wall, had too much gallantry
to leave his charmer and friend in such a
dangerous dilemma; and therefore, with admirable
presence of mind, advanced to the author
of his perplexity, and without any ceremony
or courtship, found means to make her a
party in the secret, before she could recollect herself
so far as to find fault with his proceeding. 
This measure re-established the tranquillity of
the scene: the two ladies embraced as sisters, and
vowed eternal friendship on the spot; and the
young gentleman having protested that he would
share his affection between them, and practise
the same method of visiting them in a few days,
rejoined his directress, and returned in safety to
his own lodgings, being but indifferently satisfied
with the adventure of the day, by which he found
himself obliged, either to forego all correspondence
with the woman he loved, or carry on an
intrigue with a person who was not at all to his 

liking; for the attractions of the nun were by no
means inchanting. 
He next day appeared at the grate in his own
person, and intimated his sentiments on this subject
to his mistress, who assured him, that notwithstanding
her behaviour to the sister, in the emergency
of yesterday, she would much rather be debarred
of his company for ever, than enjoy it
upon the terms which necessity had obliged him
to propose. She said, the reflection on what had
passed in the grove, had inspired her with such
an unconquerable aversion for that accidental rival,
that she could not think of her without hate
and indignation. She wished she had run all
risks, rather than submit to such detested partition; 
and vowed with great warmth, that let the consequence
be what it would, she was determined
to discover the whole affair to the abbess, if ever
he should introduce himself again, in a manner
which must subject him to the knowledge and
claim of her competitor. 
He applauded the delicacy of her sentiments,
which he swore were exactly conformable to his
own; and promised to desist from those visits that
gave her umbrage, encouraging her to hope, that
they would find some other means of settling an
intercourse, in which she should ingross his undivided
attention. Such a scheme was actually
the subject of his thoughts at that time; and a
youth of his fruitful imagination, assisted with the
counsels of such a consummate politician as the
valet de chambre, would undoubtedly have brought
it to maturation, had not his aim been anticipated
by an unforeseen accident, that flowed from the
partial administration of his favour. The nun
who had been indebted to chance for his addresses, 

was too conscious of her own inferior qualifications,
to think she could dispute the heart of our
hero with the young lady who was previously
possessed of his affection; she knew, that her
share of his good graces was altogether casual,
and that the continuance of his assiduities must
be the effect of policy and constrained complaisance; 
yet, even on these considerations, they were
too agreeable to be given up; and therefore she
resolved to guard her privilege with the most minute
vigilance and caution. Jealousy was the
natural consequence of these suggestions: the assignation
in the garden, she knew, must have been
preceded by some communication; and as there was
no other opportunity of conversing with the male
sex, except that of holding a conference through
the grate, she went to the portress, with a view
of obtaining some intelligence; and pumped the
beldame so successfully, that she learnt how her
rival had that very forenoon been favoured with a
visit by a young gentleman, whom she supposed
to be no other than their common gallant. Inflamed
with this information, she taxed the young
lady with double dealing; and scolded with such bitterness,
that the other, already prejudiced against
her pretensions, could no longer contain her resentment,
which she uttered in contemptuous
sneers against her personal attributes; and in the
pride of her wrath declared, that she ought not
to expect another interview with her lover in the
grove; for he was already too much satiated with
her charms to return to such a banquet, and had
relinquished her to the chance of meeting with
another charitable meal. 
No tygress robbed of her young was ever exalted
to an higher pitch of fury than this nun, 

when she found herself abandoned by her lover,
and insulted in this mortifying explanation. She
darted upon her antagonist, like a hawk upon a
partridge, and with her nails disfigured that fair
face which had defrauded her of her dearest expectation. 
Nor did the rival tamely bear the
barbarity of her rage; what she wanted in strength
she supplied with spirit, and twisting her hand in
the hair of the aggressor, pulled her head with
violence to the ground. The noise of this contention,
increased by the cries of the combatants,
whose tongues were more active than their hands,
brought a croud of sisters to the spot; but so
fiercely were they engaged, that they neither
minded admonitions nor threats, nor paid the
least regard to their own reputation; but on the
contrary, as if they had not known that they
were surrounded by numbers, who heard every
word that proceeded from their mouths, they
made no secret of the cause of their dispute, which,
in the precipitancy of their wrath, they divulged
with all its circumstances, to the amazement of
the by-standers. 
At length the lady abbess arrived, and what
her authority could not accomplish, was effected
by two lay-sisters, who being summoned for the
purpose, separated the rivals, who were by this
time quite exhausted with the fatigue of the battle. 
Had this mutual detection been made in any
company of females, the secret would have
hardly rested among those who heard it, much less
in a convent, where so many old maidens happened
to be present. One of these antiquated devotees
accordingly imparted it to the superior,
who having examined into the particulars, and
found the information true, from the rash recrimination 

of the incensed parties on their trial,
considered the affair as a very serious matter,
which affected the good order and reputation of
her convent, assembled all the sisters, and exhorted
them to suppress the discovery, as a circumstance
injurious to the character of the house; 
laid strict injunctions on the portress, to be very
cautious for the future in the discharge of her office,
delivered over the backsliding nun to a severe
penance prescribed by her ghostly father, and
that very day sent her boarder back to her relations,
with a hint of what had happened, and
an advice to dispose of her in some remote nunnery,
where she would be less exposed to the machinations
of her gallant. 
Our lover, utterly ignorant of this unlucky
fray and its consequence, was confounded when
the wrinkled turnkey refused to admit him to the
grate, telling him, that his impious contrivance
had come to light; that the lewd young woman,
for whose sake he had been guilty of such a flagrant
crime, was banished from the convent; and that
if ever he should make another attempt to disturb
the tranquillity of their retreat, a formal complaint
would be preferred against him to the civil
magistrate. 
Thunderstruck with this reception, he did not
think proper to advance any thing in his own
vindication, but retreated with all convenient dispatch,
not ill pleased at the issue of an adventure
which might have proved not only disagreeable,
but dangerous in the highest degree. He at once
conjectured, that the mutual jealousy of the ladies
had betrayed the intrigue; and imagined,
that now his charmer was delivered from the restrictions
of a convent, she would be more accessible 

to his endeavours. On this supposition,
he sent his couriers upon the scout; and as he
knew her name, it was not long before he learnt,
from their artful inquiries, that immediately after
her dismission from one nunnery, she had been
entered in another at Ghent, in consequence of
the superior's advice, and in all likelihood would
be compelled to take the veil by her guardians,
who were remarkably zealous for the welfare of
her soul.
