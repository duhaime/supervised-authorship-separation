Miss Howe, To Miss Clarissa Harlowe. 

Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, Monday, Aug. 7. 
My dearest Creature,
I can write just now but a few lines. I cannot
tell how to bear the sound of that Mr. Belford for
your Executor, cogent as your reasons for that measure
are: And yet I am firmly of opinion, that none
of your relations should be named for the Trust. But
I dwell the less upon this subject, as I hope (and cannot
bear to apprehend the contrary) that you will still
live many, many years. 
Mr. Hickman, indeed, speaks very handsomely of
Mr. Belford. But he, poor man! has not much penetration. 
â€”If he had, he would hardly think so well
of me as he does. 
I have a particular opportunity of sending this by a
friend of my aunt Harman's; who is ready to set out
for London (and this occasions my hurry) and is to return
out of hand. I expect therefore by him a large
packet from you; and hope and long for news of
your amended health: Which Heaven grant to the
prayers of 
Your ever-affectionate
Anna Howe.
