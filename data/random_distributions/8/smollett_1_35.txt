He performs another exploit that conveys a true
idea of his gratitude and honour. 
It was not long after this celebrated victory,
that he was invited to spend part of the
summer, at the house of a country gentleman,
who lived about one hundred miles from London,
possessed of a very opulent fortune, the
greatest part of which was expended in acts of
old English hospitality. He had met with our
hero by accident, at the table of a certain great
man, and was so struck with his manner and
conversation, as to desire his acquaintance and
cultivate his friendship; and he thought himself
extremely happy in having prevailed upon
him to pass a few weeks in his family. 
Fathom, among his other observations, perceived
that there was a domestic uneasiness, occasioned
by a very beautiful young creature,
about the age of fifteen, who resided in the
house under the title of the gentleman's niece,
though she was in reality, his natural daughter,
born before his marriage. This circumstance
was not unknown to his lady, by whose express
approbation he had bestowed particular attention
upon the education of the child, whom we
shall distinguish by the name of Celinda: their
liberality in this particular, had not been misapplied; 

for she not only gave marks of uncommon
capacity, but as she grew up, became
more and more amiable in her person, and was
now returned from the boarding-school, possessed
of every accomplishment that could be acquired
by one of her age and opportunities. 
These qualifications, which endeared her to
every other person, excited the jealousy and displeasure
of her supposed aunt, who could not
bear to see her own children eclipsed by this
illegitimate daughter, whom she therefore discountenanced
upon all occasions, and exposed
to such mortifications as would in all appearance
drive her from her father's house. This persecuting
spirit was very disagreeable to the husband,
who loved Celinda with a truly paternal
affection, and produced abundance of family
disquiet; but being a man of a peaceable and
yielding disposition, he could not long maintain
the resolution he had taken in her favour, and
therefore he ceased opposing the malevolence
of his wife. 
In this unfortunate predicament stood the
fair bastard, at the arrival of our adventurer,
who being allured by her charms, and apprized
of her situation at the same time, took the generous
resolution to undermine her innocence,
that he might banquet his vicious appetite with
the spoils of her beauty. Perhaps such a brutal
design might not have entered his imagination,
if he had not observed in the disposition
of this hapless maiden, certain peculiarities
from which he derived the most confident presages
of success. Besides a total want of experience,
that left her open and unguarded against
the attacks of the other sex, she discovered a remarkable 

spirit of credulity and superstitious
fear, which had been cherished by the conversation
of her school-fellows: she was particularly
fond of musick, in which she had made
some progress; but so delicate was the texture
of her nerves, that one day, while Fathom
entertained the company with a favourite air,
she actually swooned with pleasure. 
Such sensibility, our projector well knew,
must be diffused through all the passions of her
heart; he congratulated himself upon the sure
ascendancy he had gained over her in this particular; 
and forthwith began to execute the
plan he had erected for her destruction. That
he might the more effectually deceive the vigilance
of her father's wife, he threw such a dash
of affectation in his complaisance towards Celinda,
as could not escape the notice of that
prying matron, though it was not palpable
enough to disoblige the young lady herself, who
could not so well distinguish between overstrained
courtesy and real good breeding: this behaviour
screened him from the suspicion of the
family, who considered it as an effort of politeness,
to cover his indifference and disgust for
the daughter of his friend who had by this
time given some reason to believe she looked
upon him with the eyes of affection; so that
the opportunities he enjoyed of conversing with
her in private, were less liable to intrusion or
inquiry. Indeed, from what I have already
observed, touching the sentiments of her step-dame,
that lady, far from taking measures for
thwarting our hero's design, would have rejoiced
at the execution of it, and had she been
informed of his intent, might have fallen upon 

some method to facilitate the enterprize, but,
as he solely depended upon his own talents, he
never dreamed of soliciting such an auxiliary. 
Under cover of instructing and accomplishing
her in the exercise of musick, he could not
want occasions for promoting his aim; when
after having soothed her sense of hearing, even
to a degree of ravishment, so as to extort from
her an exclamation, importing, that he was
surely something supernatural! he never failed
to whisper some insidious compliment or tale of
love, exquisitely suited to the emotions of her
soul. Thus was her heart insensibly subdued; 
though more than half his work was still undone; 
for, at all times, she disclosed such purity
of sentiment, such inviolable attachment
to religion and virtue, and seemed so averse to
all sorts of inflammatory discourse, that he
durst not presume upon the footing he had
gained in her affection, to explain the baseness
of his desire; therefore applied to another of
her passions, that proved the bane of her virtue; 
this was her timidity, which at first being
constitutional, was afterwards increased by the
circumstances of her education, and now aggravated
by the artful conversation of Fathom,
which he chequered with dismal stories of omens,
portens, prophecies and apparitions, delivered
upon such unquestionable testimony,
and with such marks of conviction, as captivated
the belief of the devoted Celinda, and filled
her imagination with unceasing terrors. 
In vain she strove to dispel those frightful
ideas, and avoid such topics of discourse for
the future: the more she endeavoured to banish
them, the more troublesome they became; 

and such was her infatuation, that as her terrors
increased, her thirst after that sort of
knowledge was augmented. Many sleepless
nights did she pass amidst those horrors of
fancy, starting at every noise, and sweating with
dreary apprehension, yet ashamed to own her
fears, or sollicit the comfort of a bed-fellow,
lest she should incur the ridicule and censure
of her father's wife; and what rendered this
disposition the more irksome, was the solitary
situation of her chamber, that stood at the end
of a long gallery scarce within hearing of any
other inhabited part of the house. 
All these circumstances had been duly weighed
by our projector, who having prepared Celinda
for his purpose, stole at midnight from
his apartment, which was in another story, and
approaching her door, there uttered a piteous
groan; then softly retired to his bed, in full
confidence of seeing next day the effect of this
operation: nor did his arrow miss the mark:
poor Celinda's countenance gave such indications
of melancholy and dismay, that he could
not omit asking the cause of her disquiet, and
she, at his earnest request, was prevailed upon
to communicate the dreadful salutation of the
preceding night, which she considered as an
omen of death to some person in the family, in
all probability to herself, as the groan seemed
to issue from one corner of her own apartment. 
Our adventurer argued against this supposition,
as contradictory to the common observation
of those supernatural warnings, which
are not usually imparted to the person who is
doomed to die, but to some faithful friend or
trusty servant, particularly interested in the 

event. He therefore supposed that the groans
foreboded the death of my lady, who seemed
to be in a drooping state of health, and were
by her genius conveyed to the organs of Celinda,
who was the chief sufferer by her jealous
and barbarous disposition; he likewise expressed
an earnest desire to be an ear witness of
such solemn communication, and alledging that
it was highly improper for a young lady of her
delicate feelings, to expose herself alone to such
another dismal visitation, begged he might be
allowed to watch all night in her chamber, in
order to defend her from the shocking impressions
of fear. 
Though no person ever stood more in need
of a companion or guard, and her heart throbbed
with transports of dismay at the prospect
of night, she rejected his proposal with due acknowledgement,
and resolved to trust solely
to the protection of Heaven: not that she
thought her innocence or reputation could
suffer by her compliance with his request; for
hitherto, her heart was a stranger to those
young desires wich haunt the fancy and warm
the breast of youth; so that being ignorant of
her danger, she saw not the necessity of avoiding
temptation: but she refused to admit a
man into her bed-chamber, merely because it
was a step altogether opposite to the forms and
decorum of life. Nevertheless, far from being
discouraged by this repulse, he knew her
fears would multiply, and reduce that reluctance,
which, in order to weaken, he had recourse
to another piece of machinery, that
operated powerfully in behalf of his design. 
Some years ago, a twelve stringed instrument 

was contrived by a very ingenious musician, by
whom it was aptly intitled the harp of Æolus,
because, being properly applied to a stream of
air, it produces a wild, irregular variety of harmonious
sounds, that seem to be the effect of
inchantment, and wonderfully dispose the mind
for the most romantic situations. Fathom, who
was really a virtuoso in musick, had brought
one of those new fashionated guittarres into
the country, and as the effect of it was still unknown
in the family, he that night converted
it to the purposes of his amour, by fixing it in
the casement of a window belonging to the gallery,
exposed to the west wind, which then
blew in a gentle breeze. The strings no sooner
felt the impression of the balmy zephyr, than
they began to pour forth a stream of melody,
more ravishingly delightful than the song of
Philomel, the warbling brook, and all the
concert of the wood. The soft and tender
notes of peace and love were swelled up with
the most delicate and insensible transition, into
a loud hymn of triumph and exultation, joined
by the deep-toned organ, and a full choir
of voices, which gradually decayed upon the
ear, until it died away, in distant sound, as if
a flight of angels had raised the song in their
ascent to Heaven. Yet the chords hardly ceased
to vibrate after the expiration of this overture,
which ushered in a composition in the
same pathetic stile; and this again was succeeded
by a third, almost without pause or intermission,
as if the artist's hand had been indefatigable,
and the theme never to be exhausted. 
His heart must be quite callous, and his ear 

lost to all distinction, who could hear such
harmony without emotion; how deeply then
must it have affected the delicate Celinda,
whose sensations, naturally acute, were whetted
to a most painful keenness, by her apprehension; 
who could have no previous idea of
such entertainment, and was credulous enough
to believe the most improbable tale of
superstition! She was overwhelmed with awful
terror, and never doubting that the sounds
were more than mortal, recommended herself
to the care of providence in a succession of
pious ejaculations. 
Our adventurer having allowed some time
for the effect of this contrivance, repaired to
her chamber door, and in a whisper conveyed
thro' the key-hole, asked if she was awake,
begged pardon for such an unseasonable visit,
and desired to know her opinion of the strange
musick which he then heard. In spite of her
notions of decency, she was glad of his intrusion,
and being in no condition to observe
punctilios, slipped on a wrapper, opened the
door, and with a faultering voice, owned herself
frightened almost to distraction. He pretended
to console her with reflections, importing,
that she was in the hands of a benevolent
being, who would not impose upon his
creatures any task which they could not bear; 
he insisted upon her returning to bed, and
assured her he would not stir from her chamber
till day. Thus comforted she betook herself
again to rest, while he sat down in an elbow-chair
at some distance from the bed-side,
and in a soft voice began the conversation with
her, on the subject of those visitations from above, 

which though undertaken on pretence
of dissipating her fear and anxiety, was in
reality calculated for the purpose of augmenting
both. 
“That sweet air,” said he, “seems designed
for soothing the bodily anguish of some
saint in his last moments. Hark! how it rises
into a more sprightly and elevated strain,
as if it were an inspiriting invitation to the
realms of bliss! sure he is now absolved from
all the misery of this life; that full and glorious
concert of voices and celestial harps,
betoken his reception among the heavenly
choir, who now waft his soul to paradisian
joys! this is altogether great, solemn and amazing!
the clock strikes one, the symphony
hath ceased!” 
This was actually the case; for, he had ordered
Maurice to remove the instrument at
that hour, lest the sound of it should become
too familiar, and excite the curiosity of some
undaunted domestic, who might frustrate his
scheme, by discovering the apparatus. As for
poor Celinda, her fancy was, by his musick and
discourse, worked up to the highest pitch of
enthusiastic terrors; the whole bed shook with
her trepidation, the awful silence that succeeded
the supernatural musick, threw an additional
damp upon her spirits, and the artful Fathom
affecting to snore at the same time, she
could no longer contain her horror, but called
upon his name with a fearful accent, and having
owned her present situation insupportable,
intreated him to draw near her bed-side, that
he might be within touch, on any emergency. 
This was a welcome request to our adventurer, 

who asked pardon for his drousiness, and
taking his station on the side of her bed, exhorted
her to compose herself; then locking
her hand fast in his own, was again seized with
such an inclination to sleep, that he gradually
sunk down by her side, and seemed to enjoy
his repose in that attitude. Mean while, his
tender-hearted mistress, that he might not suffer
in his health, by his humanity and complaisance,
covered him with the counterpane as he
slept, and suffered him to take his rest, without
interruption: till he thought proper to start
up suddenly ,with an exclamation of, “Heaven
watch over us!” and then asked with symptoms
of astonishment, if she had heard nothing. 
Such an abrupt address, upon such an
occasion did not fail to amaze and affright the
gentle Celinda, who unable to speak sprung
towards her treacherous protector; and he catching
her in his arms, bad her fear nothing; 
for he would, at the expence of his life, defend
her from all danger. 
Having thus, by tampering with her weakneass,
conquered the first and chief obstacles
to his design, he with great art and perseverance
improved the intercourse to such a degree
of intimacy as could not but be productive
of all the consequences which he had foreseen. 
The groans and musick were occasionally
repeated so as to alarm the whole family,
and inspire a thousand varous conjectures; 
he failed not to continue his nocturnal visits
and ghastly discourse, untill his attendance
became so necessary to this unhappy maiden,
that she durst not stay in her own chamber 

without his company, nor even sleep, except in
contact with her betrayer. 
Such a commerce between two such persons
of a different sex, could not possibly be long
carried on, without degenerating from the platonic
system of sentimental love. In her paroxysms
of dismay, he did not forget to breathe
the soft inspirations of his passion, to which
she listened with more pleasure, as they diverted
the gloomy ideas of her fear; and by this
time his extraordinary accomplishments had
made a conquest of her heart. What therefore
could be a more interesting transition,
than that from the most uneasy to the most
agreeable sensation of the human breast. 
This being the case, the reader will not wonder
that a consummate traitor, like Fathom,
should triumph over the virtue of an artless innocent
young creature, whose passions he had
entirely under his command. The gradations
towards vice are almost imperceptible, and an
experienced seducer can strew them with such
inticing and agreeable flowers, as will lead the
young sinner on insensibly, even to the most
profligate stages of guilt. All therefore that
can be done by virtue, unassisted with experience,
is to avoid every trial with such a formidable
foe, by declining and discouraging the
first advances towards a particular correspondence
with perfidious man, howsoever agreeable
it may seem to be: for, here, is no security
but in conscious weakness. 
Fathom, though possessed of the spoils of
poor Celinda's honour, did not enjoy his success
with tranquillity. Reflection and remorse
often invaded her in the midst of their guilty 

pleasures, and embittered all those moments
they had dedicated to mutual bliss. For the
seeds of virtue are seldom destroyed at once:
even amidst the rank productions of vice, they
regerminate to a sort of imperfect vegetation,
like some scattered hyacinths shooting up among
the weeds of a ruined garden, that testify
the former culture and amenity of the
soil: she sighed at the sad remembrance of that
virgin dignity which she had lost; she wept at
the prospect of that disgrace, mortification and
misery she should undergo, when abandoned
by this transient lover, and severely reproached
him for the arts he had used to shipwreck her
innocence and peace. 
Such expostulations are extremely unseasonable
when addressed to a man well nigh sated
with the effects of his conquest; they act like
strong blasts of wind applied to embers almost
extinguished, which, instead of reviving the
flame, scatter and destroy every remaining particle
of fire. Our adventurer, in the midst of
his peculiarities, had inconstancy in common
with the rest of his sex. More than half cloyed
with the possession of Celinda, he could not
fail to be disgusted with her upbraidings; and
had she not been the daughter of a gentleman
whose friendship he did not think it his interest
to forfeit, he would have dropt this correspondence
without reluctance or hesitation: but, as
he had measures to keep with a family of such
consequence, he constrained his inclinations so
far, as to counterfeit those raptures he no longer
felt, and found means to appease those intervening
tumults of her grief. 
Foreseeing, however, that it would not be always 

in his power to console her on these
terms; he resolved, if possible, to divide her
affection, which now glowed upon him too intensely; 
and with that view, whenever she
complained of the vapours or dejection, he
prescribed, and even insisted upon her swallowing
certain cordials of the most palatable composition,
without which he never travelled; and
these produced such agreeable reveries and
flow of spirits, that she gradually became enamoured
of intoxication; while he encouraged
the pernicious passion, by expressing the most
extravagant applause and admiration at the
wild, irregular sallies it produced. Without
having first made this diversion, he would have
found it impracticable to leave the house in
tranquillity; but when this betwitching philtre
grew into an habit, her attachment to Ferdinand
was insensibly dissolved; she began to
bear his neglect with indifference, and sequestring
herself from the rest of the family, used
to sollicit this new ally, for consolation. 
Having thus put the finishing stroke to the
daughter's ruin, he took leave of the father
with many acknowledgements and expressions
of gratitude for his hospitality and friendship,
and riding cross the country to Bristol, took
up his habitation near the Hot-well, where he
staid during the remaining part of the season. 
As for the miserable Celinda, she became more
and more addicted to the vices in which she
had been initiated by his superlative perfidy and
craft; until she was quite abandoned by decency
and caution: her father's heart was torn
with anguish, while his wife rejoiced in her
fall: at length, her ideas were quite debased 

by her infirmity; she grew every day more and
more sensual and degenerate, and contracted
an intimacy with one of the footmen, who was
kind enough to take her to wife, in hope
of obtaining a good settlement from his master; 
but being disappointed in his aim, he conducted
her to London, where he made shift to insinuate
himself into another service, leaving to
her, the use, and partly the advantage of her
own person, which was still uncommonly attractive.
