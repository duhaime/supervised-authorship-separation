In these ticklish times, it may
be necessary to give such an
account of the following sheets,
as will exempt me from the
plague of prosecution. 
On the 7th of March, in the
present year 1748, they were offered
to me for sale, by a tall
thin woman, about the age of
threescore, dressed in a gown of
Bombazine, with a cloak and
bonnet of black silk, both a little
the worse for the wear. —She called 

herself Dorothy Hatchet, spinster,
of the parish of Old-street, administratrix
of Mr. Nathaniel Peacock,
who died in the said parish
on the fifth day of last April, and
lies buried in the church-yard of
Islington, in the north-west corner,
where his grave is distinguished
by a monumental board
inscribed with the following
tristich: 
Hic, hæc, hoc,
Here lies the block
Of old Nathaniel Peacock.
In this particular, any person
whatever may satisfy himself,
by taking an afternoon's walk to
Islington, where, at the White
House, he may recreate and refresh 

himself with excellent tea
and hot rolls for so small a
charge as eight-pence. 
As to the MS, before I would
treat for it, I read it over attentively,
and found it contained
divers curious particulars of a
foreign history, without any allusion
to, or resemblance with,
the transactions of these times. 
I likewise turned over to Kempfer
and the Universal History, and
found in their several accounts
of Japan, many of the names
and much of the matter specified
in the following sheets. Finally,
that I might run no risque of misconstruction,
I had recourse to an
eminent chamber-council of my
acquaintance, who diligently perused 

the whole, and declared it
was no more actionable than the
Vision of Ezekiel, or the Lamentations
of Jeremiah the prophet. 
Thus assured, I purchased the
copy, which I now present in
print, with my best respects, to
the Courteous Reader, being his
very humble servant, 
Bucklersbury.
