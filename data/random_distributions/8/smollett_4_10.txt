I arrive at Newcastle—meet with my old
school-fellow Strap—we determine to
walk in company to London—set out on our
journey—put up at a solitary ale-house
—are disturbed by a strange adventure
in the night. 
There is no such convenience as a waggon
in this country, and my finances were
too weak to support the expence of hiring a horse; 
I determined therefore to set out with the carriers,
who transport goods from one place to another
on horse-back, this I accordingly put in execution,
on the first day of November 1739, sitting
upon a pack-saddle between two baskets; one of
which contained my goods in a knapsack. But
by the time we arrived at Newcastle upon Tyne,
I was so fatigued with the tediousness of the 

carriage, and benumbed with the coldness of the
weather, that I resolved to travel the rest of my
journey on foot, rather than proceed in such a
disagreeable manner. 
The hostler of the inn at which we put up,
understanding I was bound for London, advised
me to take my passage in a collier, which would
be both cheap and expeditious, and withal much
easier than to walk upwards of three hundred
miles through deep roads, in the winter time; 
which he believed I had not strength enough to
perform. —I was almost persuaded to take his
advice, when, one day, stepping into a barber's
shop to be shaved, the young man, while he lathered
my face, accosted me thus: “Sir, I presume
you are a Scotchman.” To which I answered
in the affirmative. —“Pray (continued
he) of what part of Scotland?” —I no sooner
told him, than he discovered great emotion, and
not confining his operation to my chin and
upper lip, besmeared my whole face with great
agitation. —At which I was so offended, that
starting up, I asked him what the d&wblank;I he meant
by using me so? —He begged pardon, telling me
his joy in meeting with a countryman, had occasioned
some confusion in him; and craved my
name. —But when I declared my name was Random
he exclaimed in a rapture, “How! Rory
Random?” The same, I replied, looking at
him with astonishment; “What, cried he, don't
you know your old school-fellow, Hugh
Strap?” At that instant recollecting his face,
I flew into his arms, and in the transport of my
joy, gave him back one half of the suds he had
so lavishly bestowed on my countenance; so that
we made a very ludicrous appearance, and furnished 

a great deal of mirth to his master and
shop-mates, who were witnesses of this scene. — 
When our mutual caresses were over, I sat down
again to be shaved, but the poor fellow's nerves
were so discomposed by this unexpected meeting,
that his hand could scarcely hold the razor, with
which (nevertheless) he found means to cut me
in three places, in as many strokes. His master,
perceiving his disorder, bid another supply his
place; and after the operation was performed,
gave Strap leave to pass the rest of the day with
me. —We retired immediately to my lodgings,
where calling for some beer, I desired to be informed
of his adventures, which contained nothing
more, than that his master dying before his
time was out, he had come to Newcastle about a
year ago, in expectation of journey-work, along
with three young fellows of his acquaintance
who worked in the keels; that he had the
good fortune of being employed by a very civil
master, with whom he intended to stay till the
spring, at which time he proposed to go to London,
where he did not doubt of finding encouragement. 
—When I communicated to him my
situation and design, he did not approve of my
taking a passage by sea, by reason of the danger
of a winter voyage, which is very hazardous along
that coast, as well as the precariousness of the
wind, which might possibly detain me a great
while, to the no small detriment of my fortune:
whereas, if I would venture by land, he would
bear me company, carry my baggage as well as
his own, all the way; and if we should find ourselves
fatigued, it would be no hard matter for us to
find on the road, either return-horses or waggons,
of which we might take the opportunity for a 

very trifling expence. —I was so ravished at this
proposal, that I embraced him affectionately, and
assured him he might command my purse to the
last farthing; but he gave me to understand, he
had saved money sufficient to answer his own occasions; 
and that he had a friend in London, who
would soon introduce him into business, in that
capital; and might possibly have it in his power
to serve me likewise. 
Having concerted our plan and settled our affairs
that night, we departed next morning by daybreak,
armed with a good cudgel each, my companion
being charged with the furniture of us both,
crammed into one knapsack, which he carried
after the manner of soldiers on a march; and our
money sewed between the lining and wastband of
our breeches, except some loose silver for our
immediate expence on the road. —We travelled
all day at a round pace, but being ignorant of the
proper stages, we were benighted at a good distance
from any inn, which compelled us to take
up our lodging at a small hedge ale-house, that
stood by itself on a by-road, about half a mile
from the high-way: There we found a pedlar of
our own country, in whose company we regaled
ourselves with bacon and eggs and a glass of good
ale, before a comfortable fire, conversing all the
while very sociably with the landlord and his daughter,
an hale buxome lass, who entertained us with
great good humour, and in whose affection I was
vain enough to believe I had made some progress. — 
About eight a clock, we were all three, at our
own desire, shewn into an apartment, where were
two beds, in one of which Strap and I betook
ourselves to rest, and the pedlar occupied the
other, though not before he had prayed a considerable 

time extempore; searched into every corner
of the room, and fastened the door on the
inside with a strong iron screw, which he carried
about with him for that use. —I slept very sound
till midnight, when I was disturbed by a violent
motion of the bed, which shook under me with
a continual tremor. —Alarmed at this phœnomenon,
I jogged my companion, whom to my no
small amazement, I found drenched in sweat, and
quaking through every limb; he told me with a
low faultering voice, that we were undone; for
there was a bloody highwayman loaded with
pistols, in the next room; then, bidding me make
as little noise as possible, he directed me to a small
chink in the board partition, through which I
could see a thick set brawny fellow, with a fierce
countenance, sitting at a table in company with
our young landlady, having a bottle of ale and a
brace of pistols before them. —I listened
with great attention, and heard him say in a
terrible tone: “D&wblank;n that son of a b&wblank;h,
Smack the coachman!—he has served
me a fine trick, indeed!—but d&wblank;tion
seize me, if I don't make him repent it! — 
I'll teach the scoundrel to give intelligence to
others, while he is under articles with me.” 
—Our landlady endeavoured to appease this
exasperated robber, by saying, that he might possibly
be mistaken in Smack, who perhaps kept no
correspondence with the other gentleman that robbed
his coach,—and that if an accident had disappointed
him to day, he might soon find opportunities
enough to atone for his lost trouble. — 
“I'll tell thee what, my dear Bett (replied he)
I never had, nor never will, while my name
is Rifle, have such a glorious booty as I missed 

to-day. —Z&wblank;ds! there was 400l. in cash
to recruit men for the king's service, besides
the jewels, watches, swords, and money belonging
to the passengers;—had it been my
fortune to have got clear off with so much
treasure, I would have purchased a commission
in the army, and made you an officer's lady,
you jade, I would.” —“Well, well (cries
Betty) we must trust to providence for that; 
—but did you find nothing worth taking,
which escaped the other adventurer?” — 
“Not much, faith (said the lover;) I gleaned
a few things,—such as a pair of pops, silver-mounted
(here they are) I took them loaded
out of the pockets of the captain who had the
charge of the money, together with a gold
watch, which he had concealed in his breeches. 
—I likewise found ten Portugal pieces in the
shoes of a quaker, whom the spirit moved to
revile me with great bitterness and devotion; 
but what I value myself mostly for, is this
here purchase, a gold snuff-box, my girl, with
a young gentleman's picture on the inside of
the lid: which I untied out of the tail of a
pretty lady's smock.” —Here, as the devil
would have it, the pedlar snored so loud, that
the highwayman snatching his pistols, started up,
crying, “Hell and d&wblank;n&wblank;n! I am betrayed,— 
who's that in the next room?” Mrs. Betty
told him, he need not be uneasy, there were only
three poor wearied travellers, who, mistaking the
road, had taken up their lodging there, and were
asleep long ago. —“Travellers! says he, spies,
you b&wblank;ch! but no matter—by G&sblank;d, I'll
send them all to hell in an instant.” —He accordingly
run towards our door; when his sweetheart 

interposing, assured him, there was only a
couple of poor young Scotchmen, who were too
raw and ignorant to give him the least cause of
suspicion; and the third was a Presbyterian pedlar
of the same nation, who had often lodged in the
house before. —This declaration satisfied the thief,
who swore he was glad there was a pedlar
there, for he wanted some linen. —Then in a
jovial manner, he put about the glass, mingling
his discourse to Betty, with caresses and familiarities,
that spoke him very happy in his amours. 
During that part of the conversation which regarded
us, Strap had crept under the bed, where
he lay without sense or motion, so that it was
with great difficulty I persuaded him our danger
was over, and prevailed on him to wake the pedlar,
and inform him of what we had seen and
heard —This itinerant merchant no sooner felt
somebody shaking him by the shoulder, than he
started up, calling as loud as he could,— 
“Thieves, thieves!—L&wblank;d have mercy on us.” 
Rifle, alarmed at this exclamation, jumped up,
cocked one of his pistols, and turned towards the
door to kill the first man who should enter; 
for he verily believed himself beset; when his
Dulcinea, after an immoderate fit of laughter,
persuaded him, that the poor pedlar dreaming of
thieves, had only cried out in his sleep. —Meanwhile
my comrade had undeceived our fellow-lodger,
and informed him of his reason for disturbing
him; upon which, getting up softly he
peeped through the hole, and was so terrified
with what he saw, that, falling down on his
bare knees, he put up a long petition to heaven,
to deliver him from the hands of that ruffian, and
promised never to defraud a customer for the future 

of the value of a half-penny, provided he
might be rescued from his present distress— 
Whether or not this disburthening his conscience
afforded him any ease, I know not; but he slipt
into bed again and lay very quiet until the robber
and his mistress were asleep, which he understood
by their snoring in concert; then, rising softly,
he untied a rope that was round his pack,
and making it fast to one end of it, opened the
window with as little noise as possible, and lowered
his goods into the yard with great dexterity; 
which having done, he moved gently to our bedside,
and bid us farewel, telling us, that as we
run no risk, we might take our rest with great
confidence, and in the morning assure the landlord
that we knew nothing of his escape: then shaking
us by the hands, and wishing us all manner
of success, he let himself drop from the window
without any danger to the ground, which was not
above one yard from his feet as he hung on the
outside. Although I did not think proper to accompany
him in his flight, I was not at all free
from apprehension, when I reflected on what
might be the effects of the highwayman's disappointment,
who certainly intended to make free
with the pedlar's ware. Neither was my companion
at more ease in his mind, but on the contrary
so possessed with the dreadful idea of Rifle,
that he solicited me strongly to follow our countryman's
example, and so elude the fatal resentment
of that terrible adventurer, who would certainly
wreak his vengeance on us, as accomplice; 
of the pedlar's elopement. —But I represented to
him, the danger of giving Rifle cause to think we
knew his profession, by putting him in mind, that
if ever he should meet us again on the road (which 

far from being impossible) he would look upon
us as dangerous acquaintance, and find it his interest
to put us out of the way. —I told him
withal, the confidence I had in Betty's good-nature; 
in which he acquiesced, and during the
remaining part of the night, we concerted a proper
method of behaviour, to render us unsuspected
in the morning. 
It was no sooner day, than Betty, entering
our chamber, and perceiving the window open,
cried out, “Ods bobs! Sure you Scotchmen
must have hot constitutions, to lie all night
with the window open in such cold weather!” 
—I feigned to start out of sleep, and withdrawing
the curtain, called, “What's the matter?” 
When she shewed me, I affected surprize, and
said, “Bless me! the window was shut when
we went to bed.” —“I'll be hanged, said she,
if Sawny Waddle the pedlar has not got up in
a dream and done it, for I heard him very obstropulous
in his sleep. —Sure I put a chamber-pot
under his bed.” —With these words she
advanced to the bed in which he lay, and finding
the sheets cold, she exclaimed, “Good lack
a daisy! the rogue is fled!” —“Fled (cried
I, with a feigned amazement) G&sblank;d forbid! 
—Sure he has not robbed us.” —Then springing
up, I laid hold of my breeches, and emptied
all my loose money into my hand; which having
reckoned, I said, Heaven be praised our money
is all safe. —Strap, look to the knapsack. — 
He did so, and found all was right. —Upon which,
we asked with seeming concern, if he had stole
nothing belonging to the house. —“No, no,
replied she, he has stole nothing but his reckoning;” 
which, it seems, this pious pedlar 

had forgot to discharge in the midst of his devotion: 
Betty, after a moment's pause withdrew, and
immediately we could hear her waken Rifle, who
no sooner heard of Waddle's flight, than he
jumped out of bed and dressed, venting a thousand
execrations, and vowing to murder the pedlar if
ever he could set eyes on him again; “For, said
he, the scoundrel has by this time raised the
hue and cry against me.” —Having dressed
himself in a hurry, he mounted his horse, and
for that time rid us of his company and a thousand
fears that were the consequence of it. — 
While we were at breakfast, Betty endeavoured
by all the cunning she was mistress of, to learn
whether or no we suspected our fellow-lodger,
whom we saw take horse; but as we were on
our guard, we answered her sly questions with a
simplicity she could not distrust; when all of a
sudden, we heard the trampling of a horse's feet
at the door. This noise alarmed Strap so much,
whose imagination was wholly engrossed by the
image of Rifle, that with a countenance as pale as
milk, he cried out, “O Lord! there's the
highwayman returned!” —Our landlady startled
at these words, said, “What highwayman,
young man? —Do you think any highwaymen
harbour here?” —Though I was very much
disconcerted at this piece of indiscretion in Strap,
I had presence of mind enough to tell her, we
had met a horse-man the day before, whom Strap
had foolishly supposed to be a highwayman, because
he rode with pistols; and that he was terrified
at the sound of a horse's feet ever since. —She
forced a smile at the ignorance and timorousness
of my comrade; but I could perceive, (not 

without great concern) that this account was not
at all satisfactory to her.
