Anecdotes of poverty, and experiments for the
benefit of those whom it may concern 
His affairs being thus circumstanced, it is
not to be supposed that he passed his time
in tranquillity. Every day ushered in new demands
and fresh anxiety: for, though his œconomy
was frugal, it could not be supported
without money; and now not only his funds
were drained, but also his private friends tired
of relieving his domestic necessities: nay, they
began to relinquish his company, which formerly
they had coveted; and those who still
favoured him with their company, embittered
that favour with disagreeable advice mingled
with impertinent reproof. They loudly exclaimed 

against the last instance of his friendship
for Fathom as a piece of wrong headed
extravagance, which neither his fortune could
afford, nor his conscience excuse; and alledged
that such specimens of generosity are vicious in
any man, let his finances be never so opulent,
if he has any relations of his own who need
his assistance; but altogether scandalous, not to
say unjust, in a person who depends for his
his own support upon the favour of his friends. 
These expostulations did not even respect the
beauteous, the accomplished, the gentle hearted,
the orphan Monimia. Although they owned
her perfections, and did not deny that it would
be highly meritorious in any man of fortune to
make her happy, they disapproved of Renaldo's
attachment to the fair beggar, made light of
that intimate union of hearts which subsisted
between the two lovers, and which no humain
consideration could dissolve; and some among
them, in the consummation of their prudence,
ventured to hint a proposal of providing for
her in the service of some lady of fashion. 
Any reader of sensibility will easily conceive
how these admonitions were relished by a young
gentleman, whose pride was indomitable, whose
notions of honour were scrupulously rigid and
romantic, whose temper was warm, and whose
love was intense. Every such suggestion was
a dagger to his soul; and what rendered the
torture more exquisite, he lay under obligations
to those very persons, whose selfish and
sordid sentiments he disdained; so that he
was restricted by gratitude from giving vent to
his indignation and his forlorn circumstances
would not permit him to renounce their acquaintance. 

While he struggled with these
mortifications his wants grew more and more
importunate, and his creditors became clamorous. 
Fathom, to whom all his grievances were
disclosed, lamented his hard hap with all the
demonstrations of sympathy which he could
expect to find in such a zealous adherent; he
upbraided himself incessantly as the cause of
his patron's distress; took God to witness,
that he would rather have perished in jail,
than have enjoyed his liberty, had he known
it would have cost his dearest friend and benefactor
one tenth part of the anguish he now
saw him suffer; and in conclusion, the fervency
of his affection glowed to such a degree, that
he offered to beg, steal, or plunder on the high
way, for Renaldo's assistance. 
Certain it is, he might have recollected a less
disagreeable expedient than any of these, to
alleviate the pangs of this unhappy lover; for
at that very period, he was possessed of money
and moveables to the amount of a much greater
sum than that which was necessary to remove
the severest pangs of the Count's misfortune. 
But, whether he did not reflect upon
this resource, or was willing to let Melvil be
better acquainted with adversity, which is the
great school of life, I shall leave the reader to
detemine: yet, so far was he from supplying
the wants of the young Hungarian, that he did
not scruple to receive a share of the miserable
pittence which that gentleman made shift to
extort from the complaisance of a few companions,
whose countenance he still enjoyed. 
Renaldo's life was now become a sacrifice to 

the most poignant distress: almost his whole
time was ingrossed by a double scheme comprehending
his efforts to render his departure
practicable, and his expedients for rasing the
means of daily bread. With regard to the first
he exerted himself among a set of merchants,
some of whom knew his family and expectations?
and, for the last, he was fain to depend
upon the assistance of a few intimates, who
were not in condition to furnish him with sums
of consequence. These, however, gradually
dropped off, on pretence of friendly resentment
for his indiscreet conduct; so that he found
himself naked and deserted by all his former
companions, except one gentleman, with whom
he had lived in the most unreserved correspondence,
as with a person of the warmest friendship,
and the most unbounded benevolence; nay,
he had actually experienced repeated proofs
of his generosity; and such were the count's
sentiments of the gratitude, love and esteem
which were due to the author of these obligations,
that he would have willingly laid down
his own life for his interest or advantage. He
had already been at different times accommodated
by this benefactor, with occasional supplies,
amounting in the whole to about forty
or fifty pounds; and so fearfull was he of taking
any step by which he might forefeit the
good-will of this gentleman, that he struggled
with unparallelled difficulty and vexation, before
he could prevail upon himself to put his liberality
to another proof. 
What maxims of delicacy will not the dire
calls of necessity infringe! Reduced to the alternative
of applying once more to that beneficence 

which had never failed him, or of seeing
Monimia starve, he chose the first, as of two
evils the least, and intrusted Fathom with a
letter explaining the bitterness of his case. It
was not without trepidation that he received
in the evening, from his messenger, an answer
to this billet: but what were his pangs when
he learned the contents? The gentleman, after
having professed himself Melvil's sincere well-wisher,
gave him to understand, that he was resolved
for the future to detach himself from
every correspondence which would be inconvenient
for him to maintain; that he considered
his intimacy with the Count in that light:
yet nevertheless, if his distress was really as
great as he had described it, he would still contribute
something towards his relief; and accordingly
had sent by the bearer five guineas for
that purpose: but desired him to take notice,
that, in so doing, he laid himself under some
difficulty. 
Renaldo's grief and mortification at this disappointment
were unspeakable: he now saw
demolished the last screen betwixt him and the
extremity of indigence and woe; he beheld
the mistress of his soul abandoned to the
bleakest scenes of poverty and want; and he
deeply resented the lofty strain of the letter,
by which he conceived himself treated as a
worthless spendthrift, and importunate beggar. 
Though his purse was exhausted to the last
shilling; though he was surrounded with necessities
and demands, and knew not how to
provide another meal for his fair dependent,
he, in opposition to all the suggestions and eloquence
of Fathom, dispatched him with the 

money and another billet, intimating in the
most respectful terms, that he approved of his
friend's new adopted maxim, which, for the
future, he should always take care to remember; 
and that he had sent back the last instance
of his bounty, as a proof how little he
was disposed to incommode his benefactor. 
This letter, though sincerely meant, and
written in a very serious mood, the gentleman
considered as an ungrateful piece of irony, and
in that opinion complained to several persons
of the Count's acquaintance, who unanimously
exclaimed against him, as a sordid, unthankful,
and profligate knave, that abused and reviled
those very people who had generously
befriended him, whenever they found it inconvenient
to nourish his extravagance with further
supplies. Notwithstanding these accumulated
oppressions, he still persevered with fortitude
in his endeavours to disentangle himself
from this maze of misery. To these he was
encouraged by a letter which about this time
he received from his sister, importing, that she
had good reason to believe the real will of her
father had been suppressed for certain sinister
views; and desiring him to hasten his departure
for Hungary, where he would still find
some friends who were both able and willing
to support his cause. He had some trinkets
left; the pawn-broker's shop was still open; 
and hitherto he had made shift to conceal from
Monimia the extent of his affliction. 
The money-broker whom he employed, after
having amused him with a variety of
schemes, which served no other purpose than
that of protracting his own job, at length undertook 

to make him acquainted with a set of
monied men who had been very adventurous
in lending sums upon personal security; he
was therefore introduced to their club, in the
most favourable manner, after the broker had
endeavoured to prepossess them separately, with
magnificent ideas of his family and fortune. 
By means of this anticipation, he was received
with a manifest relaxation of that severity,
which people of this class mingle in their aspects
to the world in general; and they even
vied with each other in their demonstrations of
hospitality and respect; for every one in particular
looked upon him as a young heir, who
would bleed freely, and mortgage at cent per
cent. 
Renaldo, buoyed up with these exterior civilities,
began to flatter himself with hopes of
success, which, however, were soon checked
by the nature of the conversation; during
which the chair-man upbraided one of the
members in open club, for having once lent
forty pounds upon slight security: the person
accused alledged in his own defence, that the
borrower was his own kindsman, whose funds
he knew to be sufficient; that he had granted
his bond, and been at the expence of insuring
his life for the money; and, in conclusion,
had discharged it to the day with great punctuality. 
These allegations were not deemed exculpatory
by the rest of the assembly, who with
one voice pronounced him guilty of unwarrantable
rashness and indiscretion, which, in
time coming, must undoubtedly operate to the
prejudice of his character and credit. 
This was a bitter declaration to the young 

Count, who, nevertheless, endeavoured to improve
the footing he had gained among them,
by courting their company, conforming to
their manners, and attentively listening to their
discourse. When he had cultivated them with
great assiduity, for the space of some weeks,
dined at their houses upon pressing invitations,
and received repeated offers of service and
friendship, believing that things were now ripe
for the purpose, he one day, at a tavern to
which he had invited him to dinner, ventured
to disclose his situation to him, whose countenance
was the least unpromising; and as he introduced
the business with a proposal of borrowing
money, he perceived his eyes sparkle
with a visible alacrity, from which he drew an
happy presage. But, alas! this was no more
than a transient gleam of sunshine, which was
suddenly obumbrated by the sequel of his explanation; 
insomuch, that, when the merchant
understood the nature of the security, his visage
was involved in a most disagreeable gloom,
and his eyes distorted into a most hideous obliquity
of vision: indeed, he squinted so horribly,
that Renaldo was amazed and almost affrighted
at his looks, until he perceived that
this distortion proceeded from concern for a
silver tobacco-box which he had laid down by
him on the table, after having filled his pipe:
as the youth proceeded to unfold his necessities,
the other became gradually alarmed for
this utensil, to which he darted his eyes askance
in this præternatural direction, until he had
slyly secured it in his pocket. 
Having made this successful conveyance, he
shifted his eyes alternately from the young gentleman 

to the broker, for a considerable pause,
during which he in silence reproached the last
for introducing such a beggarly varlet to his
acquaintance; then taking the pipe from his
mouth, “Sir, (said he, addressing himself to
the Count) if I had all the inclination in the
world to comply with your proposal, it is really
not in my power: my correspondents abroad
have remitted such a number of bad bills of
late, that all my running cash hath been exhausted
in supporting their credit. Mr Ferret,
sure I am, you was not ignorant of my situation; 
and I'm not a little surprized, that you
should bring the gentleman to me, on business
of this kind: but, as the Wise Man observes,
Bray a fool in a mortar, and he'll never be
wise.” So saying, with a most emphatic
glance directed to the broker, he rung the bell,
and called for the reckoning; when, finding
that he was to be the guest of Renaldo,he
thanked him drily for his good chear, and in
an abrupt manner took himself away. 
Though baffled in this quarter, the young
gentleman would not despair; but forthwith
employed Mr Ferret in an application to another
of the society; who, after having heard
the terms of his commission, desired him to
tell his principal, that he could do nothing,
without the concurrence of his partner, who
happened to be at that time in one of our American
plantations: a third being sollicited,
excused himself on account of an oath which
he had lately taken, on the back of a considerable
loss: a fourth being tried, made answer,
that it was not in his way: and a fifth candidly 

owned, that he never lent money without
proper security. 
Thus the forlorn Renaldo tried every experiment
without success, and now saw the last
ray of hope extinguished. Well nigh destitute
of present support, and encompassed with unrelenting
duns, he was obliged to keep within
doors, and seek some comfort in the conversation
of his charming mistress, and his faithful
friend: yet, even there, he experienced the extremest
rigour of adverse fate. Every rap at
the door alarmed him with the expectation of
some noisy tradesman demanding payment: 
When he endeavoured to amuse himself with
drawing, some unlucky feature of the occasional
portrait recalled the image of an obdurate
creditor, and made him tremble at the work of
his own hands. When he fled for shelter to
the flattering creation of fancy, some abhorred
idea always started up amidst the gay vision,
and dissolved the pleasing enchantment. Even
the seraphic voice of Monimia had no longer
power to compose the anxious tumults of his
mind: every song she warbled, every tune she
played, recalled to his remembrance some scene
of love and happiness elapsed; and overwhelmed
his soul with the woful comparison of past
and present fate. He saw all that was amiable
and perfect in woman, all that he held most
dear and sacred upon earth, tottering on the
brink of misery, without knowing the danger
of her situation, and found himself unable to
prevent her fall, or even to forewarn her of
the peril; for, as we have already observed,
his soul could not brook the thought of communicating 

the tidings of distress to the tender-hearted
Monimia.
