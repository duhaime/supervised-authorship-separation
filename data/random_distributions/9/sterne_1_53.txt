And how do you find the
French? said the Count de
B****, after he had given me the
passport. 
The reader may suppose, that after
so obliging a proof of courtesy, I
could not be at a loss to say something
handsome to the enquiry. 
—Mais passe, pour cela—Speak
frankly, said he; do you find all the
urbanity in the French which the 

world give us the honour of? —I had
found every thing, I said, which confirmed
it—Vraiment, said the Count. 
—Les François sont polis. —To an excess,
replied I. 
The Count took notice of the word
excesse; and would have it I meant
more than I said. I defended myself
a long time as well as I could
against it—he insisted I had a reserve,
and that I would speak my opinion
frankly. 
I believe, Mons. le Count, said
I, that man has a certain compass, as
well as an instrument; and that the
social and other calls have occasion
by turns for every key in him; so 

that if you begin a note too high
or too low, there must be a want
either in the upper or under part,
to fill up the system of harmony. — 
The Count de B**** did not understand
music, so desired me to explain
it some other way. A polish'd
nation, my dear Count, said I, makes
every one its debtor; and besides,
urbanity itself, like the fair sex, has
so many charms, it goes against the
heart to say it can do ill; and
yet, I believe, there is but a certain
line of perfection that man, take him
altogether, is empower'd to arrive at
—if he gets beyond, he rather exchanges
qualities than gets them. 
I must not presume to say how far this
has affected the French in the subject 

we are speaking of—but should
it ever be the case of the English, in
the progress of their refinements, to
arrive at the same polish which distinguishes
the French, if we did not
lose the politesse de cœur, which inclines
men more to humane actions,
than courteous ones, we should at
least lose that distinct variety and
originality of character, which distinguishes
them, not only from each
other, but from all the world besides. 
I had a few king William's shillings
as smooth as glass in my pocket; 
and foreseeing they would be of use
in the illustration of my hypothesis, 

I had got them into my hand, when
I had proceeded so far— 
See, Monsieur le Count, said I,
rising up, and laying them before
him upon the table—by jingling and
ribbing one against another for seventy
years together in one body's pocket
or another's, they are become so
much alike you can scarce distinguish
one shilling from another. 
The English, like antient medals,
kept more apart, and passing but few
peoples hands, preserve the first
sharpnesses which the fine hand of nature
has given them—they are not
so pleasant to feel—but in return, 

the legend is so visible, that at the
first look you see whose image and
superscription they bear. —But the
French, Mons. le Count, added I,
wishing to soften what I had said, have
so many excellencies, they can the
better spare this—they are a loyal, a
gallant, a generous, an ingenious,
and good-temper'd people as is
under heaven—if they have a fault
—they are too serious. 
Mon Dieu! cried the Count, rising
out of his chair. 
Mais vous plaisantez, said he, correcting
his exclamation. —I laid my
hand upon my breast, and with earnest 

gravity assured him it was my
most settled opinion. 
The Count said he was mortified,
he could not stay to hear my reasons,
being engaged to go that moment
to dine with the Duc de
C*****. 
But if it is not too far to come to
Versailles to eat your soup with me,
I beg, before you leave France, I may
have the pleasure of knowing you
retract your opinion—or, in what
manner you support it. —But if you
do support it, Mons. Anglois, said
he, you must do it with all your
powers, because you have the whole 

world against you. —I promised the
Count I would do myself the honour
of dining with him before I set out
for Italy—so took my leave.
