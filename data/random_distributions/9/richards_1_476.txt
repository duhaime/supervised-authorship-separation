Mr. Belford, To William Morden, Esq; 

London, Sept. 4. 
Sir,
The urgency of the case, and the opportunity by
your servant, will sufficiently apologize for this
trouble from a stranger to your person; who, however,
is not a stranger to your merit. 
I understand you are employing your good offices
with the Parents of Miss Clarissa Harlowe, and other
relations, to reconcile them to the most meritorious
Daughter and Kinswoman, that ever family had to
boast of. 
Generously as this is intended by you, we here have
too much reason to think all your solicitudes on this 

head will be unnecessary: For it is the opinion of every
one who has the honour of being admitted to her presence,
that she cannot live over three days: So that
if you wish to see her alive, you must lose no time to
come up. 
She knows not that I write. I had done it sooner,
if I had had the least doubt that before now she would
not have received from you some news of the happy
effects of your kind mediation in her behalf. I am, Sir, 
Your most humble Servant,
J. Belford.
