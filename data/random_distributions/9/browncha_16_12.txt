My brother had received a new book from Germany.
It was a tragedy, and the fir&longs;t attempt of a
Saxon poet, of whom my brother had been taught
to entertain the highe&longs;t expectations. The exploits
of Zi&longs;ca, the Bohemian hero, were woven
into a dramatic &longs;eries and connection. According
to German cu&longs;tom, it was minute and diffu&longs;e, and
dictated by an adventurous and lawle&longs;s fancy. It
was a chain of audacious acts, and unheard-of disasters.
The moated fortre&longs;s, and the thicket; the
ambu&longs;h and the battle; and the conflict of headlong
pa&longs;&longs;ions, were pourtrayed in wild numbers, and
with terrific energy. An afternoon was &longs;et apart
to rehear&longs;e this performance. The language was
familiar to all of us but Carwin, who&longs;e company,
therefore, was tacitly di&longs;pen&longs;ed with.
The morning previous to this intended rehear&longs;al,
I &longs;pent at home. My mind was occupied with reflections
relative to my own &longs;ituation. The sentiment
which lived with chief energy in my heart,
was connected with the image of Pleyel. In the
mid&longs;t of my angui&longs;h, I had not been de&longs;titute of
con&longs;olation. His late deportment had given &longs;pring
to my hopes. Was not the hour at hand, which
&longs;hould render me the happie&longs;t of human creatures?
He &longs;u&longs;pected that I looked with favorable
eyes upon Carwin. Hence aro&longs;e di&longs;quietudes,
which he &longs;truggled in vain to conceal. He loved
me, but was hopele&longs;s that his love would be compensated.
Is it not time, &longs;aid I, to rectify this
error? But by what means is this to be effected?




It can only be done by a change of deportment
in me; but how mu&longs;t I demean my&longs;elf for this purpose?

I mu&longs;t not &longs;peak. Neither eyes, nor lips, mu&longs;t
impart the information. He mu&longs;t not be a&longs;&longs;ured
that my heart is his, previous to the tender of his
own; but he mu&longs;t be convinced that it has not
been given to another; he mu&longs;t be &longs;upplied with
&longs;pace whereon to build a doubt as to the true &longs;tate
of my affections; he mu&longs;t be prompted to avow
him&longs;elf. The line of delicate propriety; how hard
it is, not to fall &longs;hort, and not to overleap it!
This afternoon we &longs;hall meet at the temple. We
&longs;hall not &longs;eparate till late. It will be his province
to accompany me home. The airy expan&longs;c is
without a &longs;peck. This breeze is u&longs;ually &longs;tedfa&longs;t,
and its promi&longs;e of a bland and cloudless evening,
may be tru&longs;ted. The moon will ri&longs;e at eleven,
and at that hour, we &longs;hall wind along this bank.
Po&longs;&longs;ibly that hour may decide my fate. If &longs;uitable
encouragement be given, Pleyel will reveal his &longs;oul
to me; and I, ere I reach this thre&longs;hold, will be
made the happie&longs;t of beings. And is this good to
be mine? Add wings to thy &longs;peed, &longs;weet evening;
and thou, moon, I charge thee, &longs;hroud thy beams
at the moment when my Pleyel whi&longs;pers love. I
would not for the world, that the burning blu&longs;hes,
and the mounting raptures of that moment, &longs;hould
be vi&longs;ible.
But what encouragement is wanting? I mu&longs;t
be regardful of in&longs;urmountable limits. Yet when
minds are imbued with a genuine &longs;ympathy, are
not words and looks &longs;uperfluous? Are not motion
and touch &longs;ufficient to impart feelings &longs;uch as mine?
Has he not eyed me at moments, when the pre&longs;&longs;ure
of his hand has thrown me into tumults, and was




it po&longs;&longs;ible that he mi&longs;took the impetuo&longs;ities of love,
for the eloquence of indignation?
But the ha&longs;tening evening will decide. Would
it were come! And yet I &longs;hudder at its near approach.
An interview that mu&longs;t thus terminate,
is &longs;urely to be wi&longs;hed for by me; and yet it is not
without its terrors. Would to heaven it were come
and gone!
I feel no reluctance, my friends to be thus explicit.
Time was, when the&longs;e emotions would be
hidden with immea&longs;urable &longs;olicitude, from every
human eye. Alas! the&longs;e airy and fleeting impulses
of &longs;hame are gone. My &longs;cruples were
prepo&longs;terous and criminal. They are bred in all
hearts, by a perver&longs;e and vicious education, and
they would &longs;till have maintained their place in my
heart, had not my portion been &longs;et in mi&longs;ery. My
errors have taught me thus much wi&longs;dom; that
tho&longs;e &longs;entiments which we ought not to di&longs;clo&longs;e, it
is criminal to harbour.
It was propo&longs;ed to begin the rehear&longs;al at four
o'clock; I counted the minutes as they pa&longs;&longs;ed;
their flight was at once too rapid and too &longs;low;
my &longs;en&longs;ations were of an excruciating kind; I could
ta&longs;te no food, nor apply to any talk, nor enjoy a
moment's repo&longs;e: when the hour arrived, I hastened
to my brother's.
Pleyel was not there. He had not yet come.
On ordinary occa&longs;ions, he was eminent for punctuality.
He had te&longs;tified great eagerne&longs;s to &longs;hare
in the plea&longs;ures of this rehear&longs;al. He was to divide
the ta&longs;k with my brother, and, in ta&longs;ks like the&longs;e,
he always engaged with peculiar zeal. His elocution
was le&longs;s &longs;weet than &longs;onorous; and, therefore,
better adapted than the mellifluences of his
friend, to the outrageous vehemence of this drama.






What could detain him? Perhaps he lingered
through forgetfulne&longs;s. Yet this was incredible.
Never had his memory been known to fail upon
even more trivial occa&longs;ions. Not le&longs;s impo&longs;&longs;ible
was it, that the &longs;cheme had lo&longs;t its attractions, and
that he &longs;taid, becau&longs;e his coming would afford him
no gratification. But why &longs;hould we expect him
to adhere to the minute?
An half hour elap&longs;ed, but Pleyel was &longs;till at a
di&longs;tance. Perhaps he had mi&longs;under&longs;tood the hour
which had been propo&longs;ed. Perhaps he had conceived
that to-morrow, and not to-day, had been
&longs;elected for this purpo&longs;e: but no. A review of preceding
circum&longs;tances demon&longs;trated that &longs;uch misapprehension
was impo&longs;&longs;ible; for he had him&longs;elf
propo&longs;ed this day, and this hour. This day, his
attention would not otherwi&longs;e be occupied; but to-morrow,
an indi&longs;pen&longs;ible engagement was fore&longs;een,
by which all his time would be engro&longs;&longs;ed: his detention,
therefore, mu&longs;t be owing to &longs;ome unforeseen
and extraordinary event. Our conjectures
were vague, tumultuous, and &longs;ometimes fearful.
His &longs;ickne&longs;s and his death might po&longs;&longs;ibly have detained
him.
Tortured with &longs;u&longs;pen&longs;e, we &longs;at gazing at each
other, and at the path which led from the road.
Every hor&longs;eman that pa&longs;&longs;ed was, for a moment,
imagined to be him. Hour &longs;ucceeded hour, and
the &longs;un, gradually declining, at length, di&longs;appeared.
Every &longs;ignal of his coming proved &longs;allacious, and
our hopes were at length di&longs;mi&longs;&longs;ed. His ab&longs;ence
affected my friends in no in&longs;upportable degree.
They &longs;hould be obliged, they &longs;aid, to defer this undertaking
till the morrow; and, perhaps, their impatient
curio&longs;ity would compel them to di&longs;pen&longs;e entirely
with his pre&longs;ence. No doubt, &longs;ome harmle&longs;s





occurrence had diverted him from his purpo&longs;e;
and they tru&longs;ted that they &longs;hould receive a satisfactory
account of him in the morning.
It may be &longs;uppo&longs;ed that this di&longs;appointment affected
me in a very different manner. I turned a&longs;ide
my head to conceal my tears. I fled into &longs;olitude,
to give vent to my reproaches, without interruption
or re&longs;traint. My heart was ready to bur&longs;t with
indignation and grief. Pleyel was not the only object
of my keen but unju&longs;t upbraiding. Deeply did
I execrate my own folly. Thus fallen into ruins
was the gay fabric which I had reared! Thus had
my golden vi&longs;ion melted into air!
How fondly did I dream that Pleyel was a lover!
If he were, would he have &longs;uffered any ob&longs;tacle to
hinder his coming? Blind and infatuated man! I
exclaimed. Thou &longs;porte&longs;t with happine&longs;s. The
good that is offered thee, thou ha&longs;t the in&longs;olence and
folly to refu&longs;e. Well, I will henceforth intru&longs;t
my felicity to no one's keeping but my own.
The fir&longs;t agonies of this di&longs;appointment would
not allow me to be rea&longs;onable or ju&longs;t. Every
ground on which I had built the per&longs;ua&longs;ion that
Pleyel was not unimpre&longs;&longs;ed in my favor, appeared
to vani&longs;h. It seemed as if I had been mi&longs;led into
this opinion, by the mo&longs;t palpable illu&longs;ions.
I made &longs;ome trifling excu&longs;e, and returned, much
earlier than I expected, to my own hou&longs;e. I retired
early to my chamber, without de&longs;igning to
&longs;leep. I placed my&longs;elf at a window, and gave the
reins to reflection.
The hateful and degrading impul&longs;es which had
lately controuled me were, in &longs;ome degree, removed.
New dejection &longs;ucceeded, but was now
produced by contemplating my late behaviour.
Surely that pa&longs;&longs;ion is worthy to be abhorred which




ob&longs;cures our under&longs;tanding, and urges us to the
commi&longs;&longs;ion of inju&longs;tice. What right had I to expect
his attendance? Had I not demeaned my&longs;elf
like one indifferent to his happine&longs;s, and as having
be&longs;towed my regards upon another? His ab&longs;ence
might be prompted by the love which I con&longs;idered
his ab&longs;ence as a proof that he wanted. He came
not becau&longs;e the &longs;ight of me, the &longs;pectacle of my
coldne&longs;s or aver&longs;ion, contributed to his de&longs;pair.
Why &longs;hould I prolong, by hyprocri&longs;y or &longs;ilence,
his mi&longs;ery as well as my own? Why not deal
with him explicity, and a&longs;&longs;ure him of the truth?
You will hardly believe that, in obedience to
this &longs;ugge&longs;tion, I ro&longs;e for the purpo&longs;e of ordering
a light, that I might in&longs;tantly make this confe&longs;&longs;ion
in a letter. A &longs;econd thought &longs;hewed me the rashness
of this &longs;cheme, and I wondered by what infirmity
of mind I could be betrayed into a momentary
approbation of it. I &longs;aw with the utmo&longs;t
clearne&longs;s that a confe&longs;&longs;ion like that would be the
mo&longs;t remedile&longs;s and unpardonable outrage upon the
dignity of my &longs;ex, and utterly unworthy of that
pa&longs;&longs;ion which controuled me.
I re&longs;umed my &longs;eat and my mu&longs;ing. To account
for the ab&longs;ence of Pleyel became once more the
&longs;cope of my conjectures. How many incidents
might occur to rai&longs;e an in&longs;uperable impediment in
his way? When I was a child, a &longs;cheme of pleasure,
in which he and his &longs;i&longs;ter were parties, had
been, in like manner, fru&longs;trated by his ab&longs;ence; but
his ab&longs;ence, in that in&longs;tance, had been occa&longs;ioned
by his falling from a boat into the river, in consequence
of which he had run the mo&longs;t imminent
hazard of being drowned. Here was a &longs;econd disappointment
endured by the &longs;ame per&longs;ons, and produced
by his failure. Might it not originate in the




&longs;ame cau&longs;e? Had he not de&longs;igned to cro&longs;s the river
that morning to make &longs;ome nece&longs;&longs;ary purcha&longs;es in
Jer&longs;ey? He had preconcerted to return to his own
hou&longs;e to dinner; but, perhaps, some di&longs;a&longs;ter had
befallen him. Experience had taught me the insecurity
of a canoe, and that was the only kind of
boat which Pleyel u&longs;ed: I was, likewi&longs;e, actuated
by an hereditary dread of water. The&longs;e circumstances
combined to be&longs;tow con&longs;iderable plau&longs;ibility
on this conjecture; but the con&longs;ternation with
which I began to be &longs;eized was allayed by reflecting,
that if this di&longs;a&longs;ter had happened my brother
would have received the &longs;peedie&longs;t information of it.
The con&longs;olation which this idea imparted was ravished
from me by a new thought. This di&longs;a&longs;ter
might have happened, and his family not be apprized
of it. The fir&longs;t intelligence of his fate may be
communicated by the livid corp&longs;e which the tide
may ca&longs;t, many days hence, upon the &longs;hore.
Thus was I di&longs;tre&longs;&longs;ed by oppo&longs;ite conjectures:
thus was I tormented by phantoms of my own creation.
It was not always thus. I can a&longs;certain
the date when my mind became the victim of this
imbecility; perhaps it was coeval with the inroad
of a fatal pa&longs;&longs;ion; a pa&longs;&longs;ion that will never rank
me in the number of its eulogi&longs;ts; it was alone
&longs;ufficient to the extermination of my peace: it was
it&longs;elf a plenteous &longs;ource of calamity, and needed
not the concurrence of other evils to take away the
attractions of exi&longs;tence, and dig for me an untimely
grave.
The &longs;tate of my mind naturally introduced a
train of reflections upon the dangers and cares
which inevitably be&longs;et an human being. By no
violent tran&longs;ition was I led to ponder on the turbulent
life and my&longs;terious end of my father. I




cheri&longs;hed, with the utmo&longs;t veneration, the memory
of this man, and every relique connected with his
fate was pre&longs;erved with the mo&longs;t &longs;crupulous care.
Among the&longs;e was to be numbered a manu&longs;cript,
containing memoirs of his own life. The narrative
was by no means recommended by its eloquence;
but neither did all its value flow from my relationship
to the author. Its &longs;tile had an unaffected and
picture&longs;que &longs;implicity. The great variety and circumstantial
di&longs;play of the incidents, together with
their intrin&longs;ic importance, as de&longs;criptive of human
manners and pa&longs;&longs;ions, made it the mo&longs;t u&longs;eful book
in my collection. It was late; but being &longs;en&longs;ible
of no inclination to &longs;leep, I re&longs;olved to betake myself
to the perusal of it.
To do this it was requi&longs;ite to procure a light.
The girl had long &longs;ince retired to her chamber: it
was therefore proper to wait upon my&longs;elf. A lamp,
and the means of lighting it, were only to be found
in the kitchen. Thither I re&longs;olved forthwith to
repair; but the light was of u&longs;e merely to enable
me to read the book. I knew the &longs;helf and the
&longs;pot where it &longs;tood. Whether I took down the
book, or prepared the lamp in the &longs;ir&longs;t place, appeared
to be a matter of no moment. The latter
was preferred, and, leaving my &longs;eat, I approached
the clo&longs;et in which, as I mentioned formerly, my
books and papers were depo&longs;ited.
Suddenly the remembrance of what had lately
pa&longs;&longs;ed in this clo&longs;et occurred. Whether midnight
was approaching, or had pa&longs;&longs;ed, I knew not. I
was, as then, alone, and defencele&longs;s. The wind was
in that direction in which, aided by the deathlike
repo&longs;e of nature, it brought to me the murmur of
the water-fall. This was mingled with that &longs;olemn
and enchanting &longs;ound, which a breeze produces





among the leaves of pines. The words of that
my&longs;terious dialogue, their fearful import, and the
wild exce&longs;s to which I was tran&longs;ported by my terrors,
filled my imagination anew. My &longs;teps faultered,
and I &longs;tood a moment to recover my&longs;elf.
I prevailed on my&longs;elf at length to move towards
the clo&longs;et. I touched the lock, but my fingers were
powerle&longs;s; I was vi&longs;ited afre&longs;h by unconquerable
apprehen&longs;ions. A &longs;ort of belief darted into my
mind, that &longs;ome being was concealed within, who&longs;e
purpo&longs;es were evil. I began to contend with tho&longs;e
fears, when it occurred to me that I might, without
impropriety, go for a lamp previou&longs;ly to opening
the clo&longs;et. I receded a few &longs;teps; but before I
reached my chamber door my thoughts took a new
direction. Motion &longs;eemed to produce a mechanical
influence upon me. I was a&longs;hamed of my weakness.
Be&longs;ides, what aid could be afforded me by a
lamp?
My fears had pictured to them&longs;elves no preci&longs;e
object. It would be difficult to depict, in words,
the ingredients and hues of that phantom which
haunted me. An hand invi&longs;ible and of preternatural
&longs;trength, lifted by human pa&longs;&longs;ions, and selecting
my life for its aim, were parts of this terrific
image. All places were alike acce&longs;&longs;ible to this foe,
or if his empire were re&longs;tricted by local bounds,
tho&longs;e bounds were utterly in&longs;crutable by me. But
had I not been told by &longs;ome one in league with this
enemy, that every place but the rece&longs;s in the bank
was exempt from danger?
I returned to the clo&longs;et, and once more put my
hand upon the lock. O! may my ears lo&longs;e their
&longs;en&longs;ibility, ere they be again affailed by a &longs;hriek &longs;o
terrible! Not merely my under&longs;tanding was subdued
by the &longs;ound: it acted on my nerves like an




edge of &longs;teel. It appeared to cut a&longs;under the fibres
of my brain, and rack every joint with agony.
The cry, loud and piercing as it was, was nevertheless
human. No articulation was ever more
di&longs;tinct. The breath which accompanied it did
note fan my hair, yet did every circum&longs;tance combine
to per&longs;uade me that the lips which uttered it
touched my very &longs;houlder.
“Hold! Hold!” were the words of this tremendous
prohibition, in who&longs;e tone the whole &longs;oul
&longs;eemed to be rapt up, and every energy converted
into eagerne&longs;s and terror.
Shuddering, I da&longs;hed my&longs;elf again&longs;t the wall, and
by the &longs;ame involuntary impul&longs;e, turned my face
backward to examine the my&longs;terious monitor. The
moon-light &longs;treamed into each window, and every
corner of the room was con&longs;picuous, and yet I
beheld nothing!
The interval was too brief to be artificially measured,
between the utterance of the&longs;e words, and
my &longs;crutiny directed to the quarter whence they
came. Yet if a human being had been there, could
he fail to have been vi&longs;ible? Which of my &longs;en&longs;es
was the prey of a fatal illu&longs;ion? The &longs;hock which
the &longs;ound produced was &longs;till felt in every part of
my frame. The &longs;ound, therefore, could not but
be a genuine commotion. But that I had heard it,
was not more true than that the being who uttered
it was &longs;tationed at my right ear; yet my attendant
was invi&longs;ible.
I cannot de&longs;cribe the &longs;tate of my thoughts at that
moment. Surprize had ma&longs;tered my faculties. My
frame &longs;hook, and the vital current was congealed.
I was con&longs;cious only to the vehemence of my sensations.
This condition could not be la&longs;ting. Like
a tide, which &longs;uddenly mounts to an overwhelming




height, and then gradually &longs;ub&longs;ides, my confu&longs;ion
&longs;lowly gave place to order, and my tumults to a
calm. I was able to deliberate and move. I resumed
my feet, and advanced into the mid&longs;t of the
room. Upward, and behind, and on each &longs;ide,
I threw penetrating glances. I was not &longs;atisfied
with one examination. He that hitherto refu&longs;ed
to be &longs;een, might change his purpo&longs;e, and on the
next &longs;urvey be clearly di&longs;tingui&longs;hable.
Solitude impo&longs;es lea&longs;t re&longs;traint upon the fancy.
Dark is le&longs;s fertile of images than the feeble lu&longs;tre
of the moon. I was alone, and the walls were
chequered by &longs;hadowy forms. As the moon pa&longs;&longs;ed
behind a cloud and emerged, the&longs;e &longs;hadows &longs;eemed
to be endowed with life, and to move. The apartment
was open to the breeze, and the curtain was
occa&longs;ionally blown from its ordinary po&longs;ition.
This motion was not unaccompanied with &longs;ound.
I failed not to &longs;natch a look, and to li&longs;ten when this
motion and this &longs;ound occurred. My belief that
my monitor was po&longs;ted near, was &longs;trong, and instantly
converted the&longs;e appearances to tokens of his
pre&longs;ence, and yet I could di&longs;cern nothing.
When my thoughts were at length permitted to
revert to the pa&longs;t, the fir&longs;t idea that occurred was
the re&longs;emblance between the words of the voice
which I had ju&longs;t heard, and tho&longs;e which had terminated
my dream in the &longs;ummer-hou&longs;e. There are
means by which we are able to di&longs;tingui&longs;h a substance
from a &longs;hadow, a reality from the phantom
of a dream. The pit, my brother beckoning me
forward, the &longs;eizure of my arm, and the voice behind,
were &longs;urely imaginary. That the&longs;e incidents
were fa&longs;hioned in my &longs;leep, is &longs;upported by the
fame indubitable evidence that compels me to believe
my&longs;elf awake at pre&longs;ent; yet the words and




the voice were the &longs;ame. Then, by &longs;ome inexplicable
contrivance, I was aware of the danger, while
my actions and &longs;en&longs;ations were tho&longs;e of one wholly
unacquainted with it. Now, was it not equally
true that my actions and per&longs;ua&longs;ions were at war?
Had not the belief, that evil lurked in the clo&longs;et,
gained admittance, and had not my actions betokened
an unwarrantable &longs;ecurity? To obviate the
effects of my infatuation, the &longs;ame means had been
u&longs;ed.
In my dream, he that tempted me to my destruction,
was my brother. Death was ambu&longs;hed in my
path. From what evil was I now re&longs;cued? What
mini&longs;ter or implement of ill was &longs;hut up in this
rece&longs;s? Who was it who&longs;e &longs;uffocating gra&longs;p I
was to feel, &longs;hould I dare to enter it? What monstrous
conception is this? my brother!
No; protection, and not injury is his province.
Strange and terrible chimera! Yet it would not be
&longs;uddenly di&longs;mi&longs;&longs;ed. It was &longs;urely no vulgar agency
that gave this form to my fears. He to whom all
parts of time are equally pre&longs;ent, whom no contingency,
approaches, was the author of that &longs;pell
which now &longs;eized upon me. Life was dear to me.
No con&longs;ideration was pre&longs;ent that enjoined me to
relinqui&longs;h it. Sacred duty combined with every
&longs;pontaneous &longs;entiment to endear to me my being.
Should I not &longs;hudder when my being was endangered?
But what emotion &longs;hould po&longs;&longs;e&longs;e me when
the arm lifted again&longs;t me was Wieland's?
Ideas exi&longs;t in our minds that can be accounted
for by no e&longs;tabli&longs;hed laws. Why did I dream that
my brother was my foe? Why but becau&longs;e an
omen of my &longs;ate was ordained to be communicated?
Yet what &longs;alutary end did it &longs;erve? Did
it arm me with caution to elude, or fortitude to




bear the evils to which I was re&longs;erved? My present
thoughts were, no doubt, indebted for their hue
to the &longs;imilitude exi&longs;ting between the&longs;e incidents
and tho&longs;e of my dream. Surely it was phrenzy
that dictated my deed. That a ruffian was hidden
in the clo&longs;et, was an idea, the genuine tendency of
which was to urge me to &longs;light. Such had been
the effect formerly produced. Had my mind been
&longs;imply occupied with this thought at pre&longs;ent, no
doubt, the &longs;ame impul&longs;e would have been experienced;
but now it was my brother whom I was
irre&longs;i&longs;tably per&longs;uaded to regard as the contriver of
that ill of which I had been forewarned. This
per&longs;ua&longs;ion did not extenuate my fears or my danger.
Why then did I again approach the clo&longs;et and
withdraw the bolt? My re&longs;olution was in&longs;tantly
conceived, and executed without faultering.
The door was formed of light materials. The
lock, of &longs;imple &longs;tructure, ea&longs;ily forewent its hold.
It opened into the room, and commonly moved
upon its hinges, after being unfa&longs;tened, without any
effort of mine. This effort, however, was bestowed
upon the pre&longs;ent occa&longs;ion. It was my
purpo&longs;e to open it with quickne&longs;s, but the exertion
which I made was ineffectual. It refu&longs;ed to
open.
At another time, this circum&longs;tance would not
have looked with a face of my&longs;tery. I &longs;hould
have &longs;uppo&longs;ed &longs;ome ca&longs;ual ob&longs;truction, and repeated
my efforts to &longs;urmount it. But now my mind
was acce&longs;&longs;ible to no conjecture but one. The
door was hindered from opening by human force.
Surely, here was new cau&longs;e for affright. This was
confirmation proper to decide my conduct. Now
was all ground of he&longs;itation taken away. What
could be &longs;uppo&longs;ed but that I de&longs;erted the chamber




and the hou&longs;e? that I at lea&longs;t endeavoured no
longer to withdraw the door?
Have I not &longs;aid that my actions were dictated by
phrenzy? My rea&longs;on had forborne, for a time, to
&longs;ugge&longs;t or to &longs;way my re&longs;olves. I reiterated my
endeavours. I exerted all my force to overcome
the ob&longs;tacle, but in vain. The &longs;trength that was
exerted to keep it &longs;hut, was &longs;uperior to mine.
A ca&longs;ual ob&longs;erver might, perhaps, applaud the
audaciou&longs;ne&longs;s of this conduct. Whence, but from
an habitual defiance of danger, could my perseverance
ari&longs;e? I have already a&longs;&longs;igned, as di&longs;tinctly
as I am able, the cau&longs;e of it. The frantic conception
that my brother was within, that the resistance
made to my de&longs;ign was exerted by him, had
rooted it&longs;elf in my mind. You will comprehend
the height of this infatuation, when I tell you, that,
finding all my exertions vain, I betook my&longs;elf to
exclamations. Surely I was utterly bere&longs;t of understanding.

Now had I arrived at the cri&longs;is of my fate. “O!
hinder not the door to open,” I exclaimed, in a tone
that had le&longs;s of fear than of grief in it. “I know
you well. Come forth, but harm me not. I beseech
you come forth.”
I had taken my hand from the lock, and removed
to a &longs;mall di&longs;tance from the door. I had &longs;carcely
uttered the&longs;e words, when the door &longs;wung upon its
hinges, and di&longs;played to my view the interior of
the clo&longs;et. Whoever was within, was &longs;hrouded
in darkne&longs;s. A few &longs;econds pa&longs;&longs;ed without interruption
of the &longs;ilence. I knew not what to expect
or to fear. My eyes would not &longs;tray from the
rece&longs;s. Pre&longs;ently, a deep &longs;igh was heard. The
quarter from which it came heightened the eagerness
of my gaze. Some one approached from the




farther end. I quickly perceived the outlines of a
human figure. Its &longs;teps were irre&longs;olute and &longs;low.
I recoiled as it advanced.
By coming at length within the verge of the
room, his form was clearly di&longs;tingui&longs;hable. I had
prefigured to my&longs;elf a very different per&longs;onage.
The face that pre&longs;ented it&longs;elf was the la&longs;t that I
&longs;hould de&longs;ire to meet at an hour, and in a place like
this. My wonder was &longs;tifled by my fears. Assassins
had lurked in this rece&longs;s. Some divine voice
warned me of danger, that at this moment awaited
me. I had &longs;purned the intimation, and challenged
my adver&longs;ary.
I recalled the my&longs;terious countenance and dubious
character of Carwin. What motive but
atrocious ones could guide his &longs;teps hither? I was
alone. My habit &longs;uited the hour, and the place,
and the warmth of the &longs;ea&longs;on. All &longs;uccour was
remote. He had placed him&longs;elf between me and
the door. My frame &longs;hook with the vehemence
of my apprehen&longs;ions.
Yet I was not wholly lo&longs;t to my&longs;elf: I vigilantly
marked his demeanour. His looks were grave, but
not without perturbation. What &longs;pecies of inquietude
it betrayed, the light was not &longs;trong enough
to enable me to di&longs;cover. He &longs;tood &longs;till; but his
eyes wandered from one object to another. When
the&longs;e powerful organs were fixed upon me, I
&longs;hrunk into my&longs;elf. At length, he broke &longs;ilence.
Earne&longs;tne&longs;s, and not embarra&longs;&longs;ment, was in his
tone. He advanced clo&longs;e to me while he &longs;poke.
“What voice was that which lately addre&longs;&longs;ed
you?”
He pau&longs;ed for an an&longs;wer; but ob&longs;erving my trepidation,
he re&longs;umed, with undimini&longs;hed &longs;olemnity:
“Be not terrified. Whoever he was, he ha&longs;t done




you an important &longs;ervice. I need not a&longs;k you it it
were the voice of a companion. That &longs;ound was
beyond the compa&longs;s of human organs. The knowledge
that enabled him to tell you who was in the
clo&longs;et, was obtained by incomprehen&longs;ible means.
“You knew that Carwin was there. Were you
not apprized of his intents? The &longs;ame power could
impart the one as well as the other. Yet, knowing
the&longs;e, you per&longs;i&longs;ted. Audacious girl! but, perhaps,
you confided in his guardian&longs;hip. Your confidence
was ju&longs;t. With &longs;uccour like this at hand
you may &longs;afely de&longs;y me.
“He is my eternal foe; the baffler of my be&longs;t
concerted &longs;chemes. Twice have you been &longs;aved
by his accur&longs;ed interpo&longs;ition. But for him I &longs;hould
long ere now have borne away the &longs;poils of your
honor.”
He looked at me with greater &longs;tedfa&longs;tne&longs;s than
before. I became every moment more anxious for
my &longs;afety. It was with difficulty I &longs;tammered out
an entreaty that he would in&longs;tantly depart, or &longs;uffer
me to do &longs;o. He paid no regard to my reque&longs;t,
but proceeded in a more impa&longs;&longs;ioned manner.
“What is it you fear? Have I not told you, you
are &longs;afe? Has not one in whom you more reasonably
place tru&longs;t a&longs;&longs;ered you of it? Even if I
execute my purpo&longs;e, what injury is done? Your
prejudices will call it by that name, but it merits
it not.
“I was impelled by a &longs;entiment that does you
honor; a &longs;entiment, that would &longs;anctify my deed;
but, whatever it be, you are &longs;afe. Be this chimera
&longs;till wor&longs;hipped; I will do nothing to pollute it.”
There he &longs;topped.
The accents and ge&longs;tures of this man left me
drained of all courage. Surely, on no other





occasion &longs;hould I have been thus pu&longs;illanimous. My
&longs;tate I regarded as a hopele&longs;s one. I was wholly
at the mercy of this being. Whichever way I
turned my eyes, I &longs;aw no avenue by which I might
e&longs;cape. The re&longs;ources of my per&longs;onal &longs;trength,
my ingenuity, and my eloquence, I e&longs;timated at
nothing. The dignity of virtue, and the force of
truth, I had been accu&longs;tomed to celebrate; and
had frequently vaunted of the conque&longs;ts which I
&longs;hould make with their a&longs;&longs;i&longs;tance.
I u&longs;ed to &longs;uppo&longs;e that certain evils could never
be&longs;all a being in po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;ion of a &longs;ound mind; that
true virtue &longs;upplies us with energy whcih vice can
never re&longs;i&longs;t; that it was always in our power to
ob&longs;truct, by his own death, the de&longs;igns of an enemy
who aimed at le&longs;s than our life. How was it that
a &longs;entiment like de&longs;pair had now invaded me, and
that I tru&longs;ted to the protection of chance, or to the
pity of my per&longs;ecutor?
His words imparted &longs;ome notion of the injury
which he had meditated. He talked of ob&longs;tacles
that had ri&longs;en in his way. He had relinqui&longs;hed his
de&longs;ign. The&longs;e &longs;ources &longs;upplied me with &longs;lender
con&longs;olation. There was no &longs;ecurity but in his absence.
When I looked at my&longs;elf, when I reflected
on the hour and the place, I was overpowered by
horror and dejection.
He was &longs;ilent, mu&longs;eful, and inattentive to my
&longs;ituation, yet made no motion to depart. I was
&longs;ilent in my turn. What could I &longs;ay? I was confident
that rea&longs;on in this cont&longs;t would be impotent.
I mu&longs;t owe my &longs;afety to his own &longs;ugge&longs;tions.
Whatever purpo&longs;e brought him hither, he had
changed it. Why then did he remain? His resolutions
might fluctuate, and the pau&longs;e of a few minutes
re&longs;tore to him his fir&longs;t re&longs;olutions.






Yet was not this the man whom we had treated
with unwearied kindne&longs;s? Who&longs;e &longs;ociety was endeared
to us by his intellectual elevation and accomplishments?
Who had a thou&longs;and times expatiated
on the u&longs;efulne&longs;s and beauty of virtue? Why
&longs;hould &longs;uch a one be dreaded? If I could have
forgotten the circum&longs;tances in which our interview
had taken place, I might have treated his words as
je&longs;ts. Pre&longs;ently, he re&longs;umed:
“Fear me not: the &longs;pace that &longs;evers us is &longs;mall,
and all vi&longs;ible &longs;uccour is di&longs;tant. You believe yourself
completely in my power; that you &longs;tand upon
the brink of ruin. Such are your groundle&longs;s fears.
I cannot lift a finger to hurt you. Ea&longs;ier it would
be to &longs;top the moon in her cour&longs;e than to injure
you. The power that protects you would crumble
my &longs;inews, and reduce me to a heap of a&longs;hes
in a moment, if I were to harbour a thought hostile
to your &longs;afety.
“Thus are appearances at length &longs;olved. Little
did I expect that they originated hence. What a
portion is a&longs;&longs;igned to you? Scanned by the eyes
of this intelligence, your path will be without pits
to &longs;wallow, or &longs;nares to entangle you. Environed
by the arms of this protection, all artifices will be
fru&longs;trated, and all malice repelled.”
Here &longs;ucceeded a new pau&longs;e. I was &longs;till observant
of every ge&longs;ture and look. The tranquil solemnity
that had lately po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;ed his countenance
gave way to a new expre&longs;&longs;ion. All now was trepidation
and anxiety.
“I mu&longs;t be gone,” &longs;aid he in a faltering accent.
“Why do I linger here? I will not a&longs;k your forgiveness.
I &longs;ee that your terrors are invincible.
Your pardon will be extorted by fear, and not dictated
by compa&longs;&longs;ion. I mu&longs;t fly from you forever




He that could plot again&longs;t your honor, mu&longs;t expect
from you and your friends per&longs;ecution and death.
I mu&longs;t doom my&longs;elf to endle&longs;s exile.”
Saying this, he ha&longs;tily left the room. I li&longs;tened
while he de&longs;cended the &longs;tairs, and, unbolting the
outer door, went forth. I did not follow him with
my eyes, as the moon-light would have enabled me
to do. Relieved by his ab&longs;ence, and exhau&longs;ted by
the conflict of my fears, I threw my&longs;elf on a chair,
and re&longs;igned my&longs;elf to tho&longs;e bewildering ideas which
incidents like the&longs;e could not fail to produce.
