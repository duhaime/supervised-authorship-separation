Signor Jeronymo, To Sir Charles Grandison. 


Dover, Monday night, March 12. O. S. 
Here we are, my Grandison; my father and
mother so indifferent in their healths, that we
shall have time to wait for your direction. My mother
was so incommoded, that we put in at Antibes; 
and by slow journeys, stopping a few days at Paris,
proceeded to Calais, where we hired a vessel to bring
us hither. My Brother, and Father Marescotti, are
indisposed. Camilla is not well. Mrs. Beaumont,
to whom we owe infinite obligations, is the life of us
all. 
Have you heard of the dear fugitive, who has given
us all so much disturbance, and, at this season of the
year, so much fatigue? God grant that she may be
safe in your protection, and in her right mind! Had
she been so at the time, she had never meditated such
a wild, such a disgraceful flight. The heart of the
Count of Belvedere is torn in pieces by his impatience. 
He will soon follow the man and horse whom we dispatch
with this. Signor Sebastiano will accompany
him. Juliano will stay with us. The fatigue has
been rather too much for your Jeronymo: But he
rejoices, that he has his foot on English ground; the
country that gave birth to his Grandison; and in his
hopes of seeing his kind and skilful Lowther. God
grant us a happy meeting; and that no interruption
may have been given to your nuptial happiness, by
the extravagance of a young creature, which can 

only be accounted for in her, by the unhappy disorder
of her mind! Adieu, Adieu, my Grandison! 
Jeronymo della Porretta.
