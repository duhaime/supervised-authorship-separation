My dearest Daughter,
Welcome, welcome, ten times welcome,
shall you be to us; for you come to us innocent,
and happy, and honest; and you are the Staff
of our Old-age, and our Comfort too. And tho' we 

cannot do for you as we would, yet we doubt not we
shall live comfortably together, and what with my
diligent Labour, and your poor Mother's Spinning,
and your Needle-work, I make no doubt we shall
live better and better. Only your poor Mother's
Eyes begin to fail her; tho' I bless God, I am as
strong, and able, and willing to labour as ever; and
Oh my dear Child, your Virtue has made me, I think,
stronger and better than I was before. What blessed
Things are Trials and Temptations to us, when
they be overcome! 
But I am thinking about those same four Guineas:
I think you should give them back again to your Master; 
and yet I have broke them. Alas! I have only
three left; but I will borrow it if I can, Part upon
my Wages, and Part of Mrs. Mumford, and send it
to you, that you may return it, against John comes
next, if he comes again, before you. 
I want to know how you come. I fansy honest
John will be glad to bear you Company Part of the
Way, if your Master is not so cross as to forbid him. 
And if I know time enough, your Mother will go
one five Miles, and I will go ten on the Way, or till I
meet you, as far as one Holiday will go: For that I
can get Leave for; and we shall receive you with
more Pleasure than we had at your Birth, when all
the worst was over; or than we ever had in our
Lives. 
And so God bless you, till the happy Time comes; 
say both your Mother and I; which is all at present,
from 
Your truly loving Parents.
