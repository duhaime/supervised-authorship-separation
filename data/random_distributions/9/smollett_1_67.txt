A retrospective link, necessary for the concatenation
of these memoirs. 
“Indulge me with a patient hearing,
proceeded the Hungarian, and all these
riddles soon will be explained. Inflamed with
the desire of seeing foreign countries, I disobeyed
the will of an indulgent father, from
whose house withdrawing privately, I set out
for Italy, in disguise, by the way of Tyrol,
visited Venice, Rome, Florence, and embarking
at Naples, in an English ship, arrived at
St. Lucar, from whence I repaired to Seville; 
there, in a few days, was my curiosity engaged
by the fame of the fair Serafina, who was
justly deemed the most accomplished beauty in
that part of Spain. Nay, blush not, gentle 

creature! for, by my hopes of heaven! thy
charms were even injured by the cold applause
of that report: nevertheless, I was warmly
interested by the uncommon character, and
eagerly longed to see this pattern of perfection. 
As Don Diego did not train her up in that
restraint to which the Spanish ladies are subjected,
I soon found an opportunity of seeing
her at church; and no person here present
will, I presume, doubt that I was instantly
captivated by her beauty and deportment. Had
I thought that don Diego's favour was unengaged,
perhaps I should have followed the
dictates of vanity and inexperience, and presented
myself in my own character, among
the croud of her professed admirers. I knew
her father had been an officer of distinguished
rank and reputation, and did not doubt
that he would have regarded a young soldier
of unexceptionable pedigree, and I will even
add, of unattainted fame: nor did I suppose
my own father could have objected against
such an advantageous match; but, by dint of
industrious enquiry, I learned, that the divine
Serafina was already betrothed to don Manuel
de Mendoza, and this information overwhelmed
me with despair. 
After having revolved a thousand projects
for retarding and preventing that detested
union, I resolved to avail myself of my talent
for drawing, and professed myself a master of
that science, in hope of being employed by
the father of Serafina, who, I knew, let slip
no opportunity of improving his daughter's
education. Accordingly I had the good fortune
to attract his notice, was invited to his
house, honoured with his approbation, and 

furnished with unrestricted opportunities of
conversing with the dear object of my love. 
The passion which her beauty had kindled,
was, by the perfections of her mind, inflamed
to such a degree of transport, as could not
be concealed from her penetration. She chanced
to relish my conversation; I gradually acquired
her friendship; pity was the next passion
that she entertained in my favour. I
then ventured to disclose myself, and the dear
charmer did not disapprove of my presumption. 
She and her mother had been perplexed
with some religious scruples, concerning
which they appealed to my opinion; and I
was happy enough to set their minds at ease. 
This sort of intercourse naturally created a
mutual confidence among us; and, in a word,
I was blessed with the daughter's love and mother's
approbation, Don Diego will pardon
those clandestine measures which we took,
from a full persuasion, that it was impossible
to render him propitious to the views in which
our hearts and hands were so deeply interested: 
I did not then know how little he was addicted
to superstition. 
Without entering into a detail of the schemes
we projected to delay the happiness of Mendoza,
I shall only observe, that knowing the
fatal day was, at length, unalterably fixed, we
determined to elude the purpose of don Diego
by flight, and every thing was actually prepared
for our escape. When the hour of appointment
arrived, I repaired to the place at
which I had proposed to enter the house, and
stumbled, in the dark, over the body of a man
still warm and bleeding. Alarmed at this occurrence,
I darted myself through the window, 

and rushing to the apartment of the ladies,
(immortal powers!) beheld the peerless Serafina,
and her virtuous mother, stretched on a
couch, and in all appearance deprived of life. 
The company will easily conceive what agonies
I felt at such a spectacle. I ran towards
the spot in a transport of horror! I clasped
my lovely mistress in my arms, and finding her
still breathing, endeavoured, but in vain, to
wake her from the trance: Antonia was overwhelmed
with the same lethargic power. My
fancy was immediately struck with the apprehension
of their being poisoned. Regardless
of my own situation, I alarmed the family, called
for assistance, and requested the servants to
summon don Diego to the dismal scene. I
was informed, that their master had rode forth
in manifest confusion; and while I pondered
on this surprising excursion, an apothecary in
the neighbourhood entered the chamber, and
having examined the pulses of the ladies, declared,
that their lives were in no danger, and
advised that they should be undressed and conveyed
to bed. While their women were busied
in this employment, I went into the court-yard
attended by some of the servants with lights, in
order to view the body of the man, which I
had found at my arrival. His apparel was
mean, his countenance ferocious, a long spado
was buckled to his thigh, and in his belt were
stuck a brace of loaded pistols; so that we concluded
he was some thief, who had waited for
an opportunity, and seeing the casement open,
intended to rob the house, but was prevented
and slain by don Diego himself, whose retreat,
however, did not a little confound our conjecture. 
For my own part, I remained all night 

in the house, tortured with fear, vexation and
suspence. 
My hope was altogether disappointed by
this unhappy accident, and I shuddered at the
prospect of losing Serafina for ever, either
by this mysterious malady, or by her marriage
with Mendoza, which I now despaired of being
able to defeat. The major domo having
waited several hours for his lord's return,
without seeing him appear, thought proper to
dispatch a messenger to don Manuel, with an
account of what had happened; and that nobleman
arriving in the morning, took possessing
of the house. About four o'clock in the
afternoon, Serafina began to stir, and at five
she and her mother were perfectly awake. 
They no sooner recovered the use of reflection,
than they gave signs of equal sorrow
and amazement, and earnestly called for Isabella,
who was privy to our design, and who,
after a very minute enquiry, was found in a
lone and solitary chamber, where she had been
confined. Such was the confusion of the
house, that no person ever dreamed of asking
how I had entered; each domestick, in all probability,
supposing that I had been introduced
by his fellow: so that I tarried unquestioned,
on pretence of concern for the distress of a
family, in which I had been so generously entertained; 
and by Isabella sent my respects and
duty to her ladies: she was therefore not a
little surprized, when, after every other servant
had withdrawn, she heard the lovely Serafina
exclaim, with all the violence of grief,
“Ah! Isabella, Orlando is no more!” but
their astonishment was still greater, when she
assured them of my being alive, and in the 

house. They recounted to her the adventure
of last night, which she explained by informing
them of the letters which don Diego had
intercepted: and they immediately concluded,
that he had, in the precipitation of his wrath,
killed, by mistake, the person who was found
dead in the court-yard. This conjecture alarming
them on my account, they, by the
medium of Isabella, conjured me to leave the
house, lest don Diego should return, and accomplish
his resentment; and I was persuaded
to withdraw, after I had settled the channel
of a correspondence with the confidante. 
Being now obliged to alter our measures,
because our former intention was discovered
by don Diego, I secured a retreat for Serafina
and her mother, at the house of the English
consul in Seville, who was my particular
friend; and next day understanding, from Isabella,
that her lord had not yet re-appeared,
and that don Manuel was very urgent in his
addresses, we concerted an assignation in the
garden, and that same evening I was fortunate
enough to convey my prize to the asylum I
had prepared for their reception. Inexpressible
was the rage of Mendoza, when he heard
of their elopement: he raved like one deprived
of reason, swore he would put all the
servants of the family to the rack, and in consequence
of the intelligence he obtained by
threats and promises, set on foot a very strict
enquiry, in order to apprehend the fugitives
and Orlando, who had, by some means or
other, incurred his suspicion. 
We eluded his search by the vigilance and
caution of our kind host; and while we remained
in concealment, were extremely astonished 

to hear, that the unfortunate don Diego
was proclaimed a traitor, and a price set
upon his head. This information overwhelmed
us all with the utmost affliction: Antonia
lamented, without ceasing, the disgrace of
her beloved lord, from whom she never would
have withdrawn herself, but with the lively
hope of a reconciliation, after the first transports
of his ire should have subsided, and the
real character of Orlando should have appeared:
it was not long before we had reason to
believe, that Mendoza was the accuser of don
Diego.— 
Nay, start not, Signior; Manuel was actually
that traitor: this was the turn of his
revenge; when he found himself disappointed
in the hope of possessing the incomparable
Serafina, he took a base advantage of your
absence and retreat. He posted to Madrid,
impeached you to the secretary of state, of
having maintained a criminal correspondence
with the enemies of Spain, included me in
his accusation, as a spy for the house of Austria,
and framed such a plausible tale from the
circumstances of your distress, that don Diego
was outlawed, and Mendoza gratified with a
grant of his estate. 
These melancholy incidents made a deep impression
upon the mind of the virtuous Antonia,
who, waving every other consideration,
would have personally appeared for the vindication
of her husband's honour, had not we
dissuaded her from such a rash undertaking,
by demonstrating her inability to contend with
such a powerful antagonist, and representing,
that her appearance would be infallibly attended
with the ruin of Serafina, who would 

certainly fall into the hands of the villain to
whom she had been contracted. We exhorted
her to wait patiently for some happy revolution
of fortune, and encouraged her with the hope
of don Diego's exerting himself effectually
in his own defence. 
Mean while our worthy landlord was suddenly
cut off by death; and his widow being
resolved to retire into her own country, we
secretly embarked in the same ship, and arrived
in England about eighteen months ago. 
Antonia still continued to pine over the ruin
of her house; as she could hear no tidings
of don Diego, she concluded he was
dead, and mourned with unabating sorrow. 
In vain I assured her that soon as my own affairs
should be adjusted, I would exert my
whole endeavours to find and succour him. 
She could not imagine that a man of his spirit
and disposition would live so long in obscurity; 
and her affliction derived new force
from the death of the consul's widow, with
whom she had lived in the most unbounded
intimacy and friendship. From that day her
health evidently declined: she foresaw her
dissolution, and comforted herself with the
hope of seeing her husband and her friend,
in a place where no treachery is felt, and no
sorrow is known; confident of my integrity,
and the purity of my love, she in the most
pathetic terms recommended Serafina to my
care.— 
Ha! weepest thou, fair excellence, at the
remembrance of that tender scene, when the
good Antonia, on the bed of death, joined
thy soft hand to mine, and said, “Renaldo,
I bequeath this orphan to your love; it is a 

sacred pledge, which if you cherish with due
honour and regard, internal peace and happiness
will ever smile within your bosom: but
if you treat it with indifference, dishonour or
neglect, just heaven will punish your breath
of trust with everlasting disappointments and
disquiet.” 
Signior Don Diego, I see you are moved,
and therefore will not dwell on such distressful
circumstances. The excellent Antonia
exchanged this life for a more happy state; 
and so exquisite was the sorrow of the tender-hearted
Serafina, as to toture me with the apprehension
that she would not long survive her
pious mother. How I obeyed the injunctions
of that departing saint, Monimia (for that
name she now assumed) can testify, until that
artful serpent Fathom glided into our mutual
confidence, abused our ears, poisoned our unsuspecting
faith, and effected that fatal breach,
productive of all the misery and vexation
which we have suffered, and which is now so
happily expelled.” 
“Heaven, said the Castilian, hath visited
me for the sins and errors of my youth; yet,
such mercy hath been mingled with its chastisements,
I dare not murmur or repine. The
tears of penitence and sorrow shall water my
Antonia's grave; as for Mendoza, I rejoice
at his treachery, by which the obligation of
my promise is cancelled, and my honour fully
acquitted. He shall not triumph in his guilt:
my services, my character and innocence shall
soon confront his perfidy, and, I hope, defeat
his interest: The king is just and gracious,
nor is my family and name unknown.” 
Here the Jew interposing, presented to him 

a letter from a person of consequence at Madrid,
whom Joshua had interested in the cause
of don Diego; that nobleman had already
found means to represent the case of Zelos to
his majesty, who had actually ordered don
Manuel to be confined, until the injured person
should appear to justify himself, and prosecute
his accuser according to the terms of
law: at the same time don Diego was summoned
to present himself before the king within a
limited time, to answer to the charge which
Mendoza had brought against him. 
The Spaniard's heart overflow'd with gratitude
and joy, when he read this intimation; 
he embraced the Jew, who, before Zelos
could give utterance to his thoughts, told him
that the Spanish Ambassador at London, having
been prepossessed in his favour, craved
the honour of seeing don Diego; and that he,
Joshua, was ready to conduct them to the
house. 
“Then is my heart at rest! (cried the Castilian)
the house of Zelos once more shall lift
up its head. I shall again revisit my native
country with honour, and abase the villain
who hath soiled my fame! O my children!
this day is replet with such joy and satisfaction,
as I did not think had been in the power
of heaven to grant, without the interposition
of a miracle! To you Renaldo, to you illustrious
lady, and to these worthy gentlemen,
am I indebted for the restoration of that for
which alone I wish to live, and when my heart
ceases to retain the obligation, may I forfeit
the name of a Castilian, and scorn and dishonour
be my portion.” 
Perhaps all Europe could not produce another 

company so happy as that which now sat
down to dinner in the house of madame Clement,
whose own benevolent heart was peculiarly
adapted for such enjoyment. The lovers
feasted their eyes more than their appetite,
by a tender intercourse of glances, which needed
not the slow interpretation of speech; 
while the Spaniard regarded them alternately
with looks of wonder and paternal joy, and
every individual surveyed the all-deserving
pair with admiration and esteem. 
Serafina taking the advantage of this general
satisfaction, when the heart, softened into complacency,
deposits every violent thought: “I
must now, (said she) try my interest with Renaldo:
the good company shall bear witness
to my triumph or repulse. I do not ask you
to forgive, but to with-hold your vengeance
from the wretched Fathom. His fraud, ingratitude
and villainy are, I believe, unrivalled:
yet his base designs have been defeated; and
heaven perhaps hath made him the involuntary
instrument for bringing our constancy
and virtue to the test; besides, his perfidy is
already punished with the last degree of human
misery and disgrace: the Doctor, who
has traced him in all his conduct and vicissitudes
of fortune, will draw a picture of his
present wretchedness, which, I doubt not, will
move your compassion, as it hath already excited
mine.” 
The generous hostess was ready to enforce
this charitable proposal, with all her eloquence,
when Melvile, with a look that well expressed
his magnanimity of love, replied, “Such a
boon becomes the gentle Serafina. O! every
moment furnishes me with fresh matter to admire 

the virtues of thy soul: if thou, whose
tender heart hath been so rent with misery and
anguish, canst intercede for thy tormentor,
who now suffers in his turn, shall I refuse to
pardon the miserable wretch! no, let me glory
in imitating the great example, and sollicit
Don Diego, in behalf of the same miscreant
whose perfidious barbarity cost him such intolerable
woe.” Enough, cried the Castilian,
I have disclaimed the vindictive principles of a
Spaniard; and leave the miserable object to
the sting of his own conscience, which, soon or
late, will not fail to avenge the wrongs we
have sustained from his deceit.”
