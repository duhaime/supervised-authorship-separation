He is smitten with the charms of a female adventurer,
whose allurements subject him to a new
vicissitude of fortune. 
Among those who were distinguished by
his gallantry, was the young wife of an
old citizen of London, who had granted her
permission to reside at the Hot-well for the benefit
of her health, under the eye and inspection
of his own sister, who was a maiden of fifty
years. The pupil, whose name was Mrs.
Trapwell, though low in stature, was finely
shaped, her countenance engaging, though her
complexion was brown, her hair in colour rivalled
the raven's back, and her eyes emulated
the lustre of the diamond. Fathom had been
struck with her first appearance; but found it
impracticable to elude the vigilance of her Duenna,
so as to make a declaration of his flame; 

until she herself guessing the situation of his
thoughts, and not displeased with the discovery,
thought proper to furnish him with the opportunity
he wanted, by counterfeiting an indisposition,
for the cure of which, she knew his advice
would be implored. This was the beginning
of an acquaintance, which was soon improved
to his wish; and so well did she manage
her attractions, as in some measure to fix
the inconstancy of his disposition; for, at the
end of the season, his passion was not sated; 
and they concerted the means of continuing
their commerce, even after their return to
London. 
This intercourse effectually answered the
purpose of the husband, who had been decoyed
into matrimony, by the cunning of his spouse,
whom he had privately kept as a concubine before
marriage. Conscious of her own precarious
situation, she had resolved to impose upon
the infirmities of Trapwell, and feigning
herself pregnant, gave him to understand she
could no longer conceal her condition from the
knowledge of her brother, who was an officer
in the army, and of such violent passions, that
should he once discover her backsliding, he
would undoubtedly wipe away the stains of his
family-dishonour with her own blood, as well
as that of her keeper. The citizen, to prevent
such a catastrophe, took her to wife; but soon
after perceiving the trick which had been played
upon him, set his invention at work, and at
length contrived a scheme which he thought
would enable him; not only to retrieve his liberty,
but also indemnify himself for the mortification
he had undergone. 

Far from creating any domestic disturbance,
by upbraiding her with her finesse, he seemed
perfectly well pleased with his acquisition; and
as he knew her void of any principle, and extremely
addicted to pleasure, he chose proper
occasions to insinuate, that she might gratify
her own inclination, and at the same time turn
her beauty to good account. She joyfully listened
to these remonstrances, and in consequence
of their mutual agreement, she repaired
to Bristol-spring, on pretence of an ill state of
health, accompanied by her sister-in-law, whom
they did not think proper to intrust with the
real motive of her journey. Fathom's person
was agreeable, and his finances supposed to be
in flourishing order; therefore, she selected
him from the herd of gallants, as a proper sacrifice
to the powers which she adored; and on
her arrival in London, made her husband acquainted
with the importance of her conquest. 
Trapwell overwhelmed her with caresses and
praise for her discreet and dutiful conduct, and
faithfully promised that she should pocket in
her own privy purse, one half of the spoils
that should be gathered from her gallant,
whom she therefore undertook to betray, after
he had swore in the most solemn manner, that
his intention was not to bring the affair to a
publick trial, which would redound to his own
disgrace, but to extort a round sum of money
from the Count, by way of composition. Confiding
in this protestation, she, in a few days,
gave him intelligence of an assignation she had
made with our adventurer, at a certain bagnio
near Covent garden; upon which he secured
the assistance of a particular friend and his own 

journeyman, with whom, and a constable, he
repaired to the place of rendezvous, where he
waited in an adjoining room according to
the directions of his virtuous spouse, until
she made the preconcerted signal of hemming
three times aloud, when he and his associates
rushed into the chamber, and surprised our hero
in bed with his inamorata. 
The lady, on this occasion, acted her part
to a miracle; she screamed at their approach; 
and after an exclamation of “ruined and undone!” 
fainted away in the arms of her
spouse, who had by this time seized her by the
shoulders, and begun to upbraid her with her
infidelity and guilt. As for Fathom, his affliction
was unutterable, when he found himself
discovered in that situation, and made prisoner
by the two assistants, who had pinioned
him in such a manner, that he could not stir,
much less accomplish an escape. All his ingenuity
and presence of mind seemed to forsake
him in this emergency. The horrors of
an English jury overspread his imagnation: for
he at once perceived, that the toil into which
he had fallen, was laid for the purpose; 
consequently he took it for granted, that there
would be no deficiency in point of evidence. 
Soon as he recollected himself, he begged that
no violence might be offered to his person, and
intreated the husband to favour him with a
conference, in which the affair might be compromised,
without prejudice to the reputation
of either. 
At first, Trapwell breathed nothing but implacable
revenge, but by the persuasion of his
friends, after he had sent home his wife in a 

chair, he was prevailed upon to hear the proposals
of the delinquent, who having assured
him, by way of apology, that he had always believed
the lady was a widow, made him an offer
of five hundred pounds, as an atonement for
the injury he had sustained. This being a sum
no ways adequate to the expectation of the
citizen, who looked upon the Count as possessor
of an immense estate, he rejected the terms
with disdain, and made instant application to a
judge, from whom he obtained a warrant for
securing his person till the day of trial. Indeed,
in this case, money was but a secondary
consideration with Trapwell, whose chief aim
was to be legally divorced from a woman he detested. 
Therefore, there was no remedy for
the unhappy count, who in vain offered to
double the sum: he found himself reduced to
the bitter alternative of procuring immediate
bail, or going directly to Newgate. 
In this dilemma he sent a messenger to his
friend Ratchkali, whose countenance fell when
he understood the count's condition: nor
would he open his mouth in the stile of consolation,
until he had consulted a certain solicitor
of his acquainance, who assured him
the law abounded with such resources, as
would infallibly screen the defendant, had the
fact been still more palpable than it was. He
said there was great presumption to believe the
count had fallen a sacrifice to a conspiracy,
which by some means or other would be detected; 
and in that case, the plaintiff might
obtain one shilling in lieu of damages. If that
dependance should fail, he hinted, that, in all
probability, the witnesses were not incorruptible; 

or should they prove to be so, one man's
oath was as good as another's, and thank Heaven!
there was no dearth of evidence, provided
money could be found to answer the necessary
occasions. 
Ratchkali comforted by these insinuations,
and dreading the resentment of our adventurer,
who in his despair might punish him severely
for his want of friendship, by some precipitate
explanation of the commerce they had carried
on; moved, I say, by these considerations,
and moreover tempted with the prospect of
continuing to reap the advantages resulting
from their conjunction, he, and another person
of credit with whom he largely dealt in jewels,
condescended to become sureties for the appearance
of Fathom, who was accordingly admitted
to bail. Not but that the Tyroleze knew
Ferdinand too well, to confide in his parole:
he depended chiefly upon his ideas of self interest,
which, he thought, would persuade him
to risk the uncertain issue of a trial, rather
than quit the field before the harvest was half
over; and he resolved to make his own retreat
without ceremony, should our hero be unwise
enough to abandon his bail. 
Such an adventure could not long lie concealed
from the notice of the public, even if
both parties had been at pains to suppress the
circumstances: but the plaintiff, far from seeking
to cover, affected to complain loudly of
his misfortune, that he might interest his neighbours
in his behalf, and raise a spirit of rancour
and animosity, to influence the jury against
this insolent foreigner, who had come over into
England to debauch our wives, and deflower 

our daughters: while he employed a formidable
band of lawyers to support the indictment,
which he laid for ten thousand pounds damages. 
Mean while, Fathom and his associate did
not fail to take all proper measures for his defence; 
they retained a powerful bar of council,
and the solicitor was supplied with one
hundred pounds after another, to answer the
expence of secret service; still assuring his
clients that every thing was in an excellent train,
and that his adversary would gain nothing but
shame and confusion of face. Nevertheless,
there was a necessity for postponing the trial,
on account of a material evidence, who though
he wavered, was not yet quite brought over; 
and the attorney found means to put off the decision
from term to term, until there was no
quibble left for further delay. While this
suit was depending, our hero continued to move
in his usual sphere; nor did the report of his
situation at all operate to his disadvantage, in
the polite world: On the contrary, it added
a fresh plume to his character, in the eyes of all
those who were not before acquainted with the
triumphs of his gallantry. Notwithstanding
this countenance of his friends, he himself considered
the affair in a very serious light; and
perceiving that at any rate he must be a considerable
loser, he resolved to double his assiduity
in trade, that he might be the more able to
afford the extraordinary expence to which he
was subjected.
