I found no difficulty in getting
admittance to Monsieur le
Count de B****. The set of Shakespears
was laid upon the table, and
he was tumbling them over. I
walk'd up close to the table, and
giving first such a look at the books
as to make him conceive I knew
what they were, I told him I had
come without any one to present me,
knowing I should meet with a friend
in his apartment who, I trusted, would
do it for me—It is my countryman 

the great Shakespear, said I, pointing
to his works—et ayez la bonté,
mon cher ami, apostrophizing his
spirit, added I, de me faire cet honneur
là.— 
The Count smil'd at the singularity
of the introduction; and seeing
I look'd a little pale and sickly,
insisted upon my taking an arm-chair:
so I sat down; and to save him conjectures
upon a visit so out of all
rule, I told him simply of the incident
in the bookseller's shop, and
how that had impell'd me rather
to go to him with the story of a little
embarrassment I was under, than to
any other man in France—And what 

is your embarrassment? Let me hear
it, said the Count. So I told
him the story just as I have told it
the reader— 
—And the master of my hotel,
said I, as I concluded it, will needs
have it, Monsieur le Count, that I
shall be sent to the Bastile—but I
have no apprehensions, continued I— 
for in falling into the hands of the
most polish'd people in the world,
and being conscious I was a true man,
and not come to spy the nakedness of
the land, I scarce thought I laid at
their mercy. —It does not suit the gallantry
of the French, Monsieur le
Count, said I, to shew it against invalids. 

An animated blush came into the
Count de B****'s cheeks, as I
spoke this—Ne craignez rien—Don't
fear, said he—Indeed I don't, replied I
again—Besides, continued I a little
sportingly, I have come laughing all
the way from London to Paris, and
I do not think Monsieur le Duc de
Choiseul is such an enemy to mirth,
as to send me back crying for my
pains. 
My application to you, Monsieur
le Compte de B**** (making
him a low bow) is to desire he will
not. 
The Count heard me with great
good nature, or I had not said half 

as much—and once or twice said— 
C'est bien dit. So I rested my cause
there—and determined to say no
more about it. 
The Count led the discourse: we
talk'd of indifferent things—of books
and politicks, and men—and then of
women—God bless them all! said I,
after much discourse about them,
there is not a man upon earth who
loves them so much as I do: after
all the foibles I have seen, and all the
satires I have read against them, still
I love them; being firmly persuaded
that a man who has not a sort of an
affection for the whole sex, is incapable
of ever loving a single one as he
ought. 

Heh bien! Monsieur l' Anglois, said
the Count, gaily—You are not
come to spy the nakedness of the
land—I believe you—ni encore, I dare
say, that of our women—But permit
me to conjecture—if, par hazard,
they fell in your way, that the
prospect would not affect you. 
I have something within me which
cannot bear the shock of the least indecent
insinuation; in the sportability
of chit-chat I have often endeavoured
to conquer it, and with infinite pain
have hazarded a thousand things to a
dozen of the sex together—the least
of which I could not venture to a
single one to gain heaven. 

Excuse me, Monsieur le Count,
said I—as for the nakedness of your
land, if I saw it, I should cast my
eyes over it with tears in them—and
for that of your women (blushing at
the idea he had excited in me) I am
so evangelical in this, and have such
a fellow-feeling for what ever is weak
about them, that I would cover it
with a garment, if I knew how to
throw it on—But I could wish, continued
I, to spy the nakedness of
their hearts, and through the different
disguises of customs, climates, and
religion, find out what is good in
them to fashion my own by—and
therefore am I come. 

It is for this reason, Monsieur le
Count, continued I, that I have
not seen the Palais royal—nor the
Luxembourg—nor the Façade of
the Louvre—nor have attempted to
swell the catalogues we have of pictures,
statues, and churches—I conceive
every fair being as a temple,
and would rather enter in, and see the
original drawings and loose sketches
hung up in it, than the transfiguration
of Raphael itself. 
The thirst of this, continued I,
as impatient as that which inflames
the breast of the connoisseur, has
led me from my own home into
France—and from France will lead
me through Italy—'tis a quiet journey 

of the heart in pursuit of Nature,
and those affections which rise out of
her, which make us love each other
—and the world, better than we do. 
The Count said a great many civil
things to me upon the occasion; and
added very politely how much he
stood obliged to Shakespear for
making me known to him—But,
a-propos, said he, Shakespear is full
of great things—he forgot a small
punctilio of announcing your name
—it puts you under a necessity of
doing it yourself.
