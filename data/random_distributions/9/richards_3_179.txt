My dearest Pamela,
You need not be afraid of any body's knowing
what passes between us on this cutting
Subject. Tho' I hear of it from every Mouth, yet 

I pretend 'tis all Falshood and Malice. Yet Lady
Betty will have it, that there is more in it than I
will own, and that I know my Brother's Wickedness,
by my pensive Looks. She will make a Vow,
she says, never to marry any Man living. 
I am greatly mov'd by your affecting Periods. 
Charming Pamela! what a Tempest do you raise in
one's Mind, when you please, and lay it too, at
your own Will! Your Colourings are strong; but,
I hope, your Imagination carries you much farther
than it is possible he should go. 
I am pleased with your prudent Reasonings, and
your wise Resolutions. I see nobody can advise
or help you. God only can! And his Direction
you beg so hourly, that I make no doubt you will
have it. 
What vexes me is, that on the noble Uncle of
this vile Lady ––– (why don't you call her so as well as
I?) –––expostulating with her on the Scandals she
brought on her Character and Family, she pretended
to argue, foolish Creature! for Polygamy; and said,
She had rather be a certain Gentleman's second Wife,
than the first to the greatest Man in England! 
I leave you to your own Workings; but if I
find your Prudence unrewarded by the Wretch, the
Storm you saw raised at the Hall, shall be nothing
to the Hurricane I will excite, to tear up by the
Roots all the Happiness the two Wretches propose
to themselves! 
Don't let my Intelligence, which is undoubted,
grieve you over-much. Try some way to move the
Wretch. What must be done, must be by touching
his Generosity: He has that in some Perfection. 
But how in this Case to move it, is beyond my Power
or Skill to prescribe. 
God bless you, my dearest Pamela! You shall be
my only Sister. And I will never own my Brother, 

if he be so base to your superlative Merit. Adieu
once more! 
From your Sister and Friend,
B. Davers.
