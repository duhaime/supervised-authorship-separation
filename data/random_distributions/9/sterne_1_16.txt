As the little French captain left
us, Mons. Dessein came up
with the key of the Remise in his
hand, and forthwith let us into his
magazine of chaises. 
The first object which caught my
eye, as Mons. Dessein open'd the
door of the Remise, was another old
tatter'd Desobligeant: and notwithstanding
it was the exact picture of
that which had hit my fancy so much
in the coach-yard but an hour before
—the very sight of it stirr'd up a 

disagreeable sensation within me now; 
and I thought 'twas a churlish beast
into whose heart the idea could first
enter, to construct such a machine; 
nor had I much more charity for the
man who could think of using it. 
I observed the lady was as little
taken with it as myself: so Mons.
Dessein led us on to a couple of
chaises which stood abreast, telling us
as he recommended them, that they
had been purchased by my Lord A.
and B. to go the grand tour, but
had gone no further than Paris, so
were in all respects as good as new— 
They were too good—so I pass'd on
to a third, which stood behind, and
forthwith began to chaffer for the 

price —But 'twill scarce hold two, said
I, opening the door and getting in — 
Have the goodness, Madam, said
Mons. Dessein, offering his arm, to
step in —The lady hesitated half a second,
and stepp'd in; and the waiter
that moment beckoning to speak to
Mons. Dessein, he shut the door of
the chaise upon us, and left us.
