Evelina to the Rev. Mr. Villars. 
All is over, my dearest Sir, and the fate
of your Evelina is decided! This
morning, with fearful joy, and trembling
gratitude, she united herself for ever with
the object of her dearest, her eternal affection! 
I have time for no more; the chaise now
waits which is to conduct me to dear Berry
Hill, and to the arms of the best of men. 
Evelina.
