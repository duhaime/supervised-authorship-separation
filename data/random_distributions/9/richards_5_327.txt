Lady Grandison, To Miss Jervois. 


Tuesday, May 22. 
I have a great opinion of your prudence, my
Love: And I have as high a one of Sir Edward
Beauchamp's honour and discretion. His fortune,
his merit, are unexceptionable. Your guardian loves
him. If you could certainly love Sir Edward above
all men, and he you above all women, I am of opinion
your guardian will think no alliance can be happier
for both, and for himself too: For you know,
my dear, that your welfare is near his heart. Let me,
my sweet Emily, refer you as to your conduct on
this occasion, to my own almost-unerring counsellors,
my grandmamma and aunt Selby. Don't be ashamed
to open your heart to them: Are you not under their
wings? I will so manage, that they shall lead the
way to your freedom with them. Your difficulties
by this means will be lessened. Sir Charles will pay
the greatest attention to their advice. But yet I must 

insist, that the reference to them, shall not deprive
of my Emily's confidence, 
Her ever-affectionate Sister,
and faithful Friend and Servant,
Harriet Grandison.
