Mr. Belford, To Robert Lovelace, Esq; 

Thursday Morning, Aug. 3. Six o'Clock. 
I have been so much employed in my own and Belton's
affairs, that I could not come to town till last
night; having contented myself with sending to Mrs.
Lovick, to know, from time to time, the state of
the Lady's health; of which I received but very indifferent
accounts, owing, in a great measure, to
Letters or Advices brought her from her implacable
family. 
I have now completed my own affairs; and, next
week, shall go to Epsom, to endeavour to put Belton's
Sister into possession of his own house, for him: 
After which, I shall devote myself wholly to your
service, and to that of the Lady. 
I was admitted to her presence last night; and
found her visibly altered for the worse. When I
went home, I had your Letter of Tuesday last put into
my hands. Let me tell thee, Lovelace, that I
insist upon the performance of thy engagement to me
that thou wilt not personally molest her. 

Mr. Belford dates again on Thursday morning Ten
o'Clock; and gives an account of a conversation 

which he had just held with the Lady upon the
subject of Miss Montague's Letter to her, preceding,
and upon Mr. Lovelace's alternatives,
as mentioned in Letter xiv. which Mr. Belford
supported with the utmost earnestness. But,
as the result of this conversation will be found in
the subsequent Letters, Mr. Belford's pleas and
arguments in favour of his friend, and the Lady's
answers, are omitted.
