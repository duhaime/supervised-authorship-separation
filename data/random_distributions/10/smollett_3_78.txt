The two friends eclipse all their competitors in gallantry,
and practise a pleasant project of revenge
upon the physicians of the place. 
The fame of their exploit against the sharpers,
was immediately diffused through all companies
at the Bath; so that when our adventurers
appeared in public, they were pointed out by an
hundred extended fingers, and considered as consummate
artists in all the different species of finesse,
which they would not fail to practise with
the first opportunity. Nor was this opinion of
their characters any obstacle to their reception
into the fashionable parties in the place; but, on
the contrary, such a recommendation, which (as
I have already hinted) never fails to operate for
the advantage of the possessor. 
This first adventure, therefore, served them as
an introduction to the company at Bath, who
were not a little surprized to find their expectations
baffled by the conduct of the two companions; 
because, far from engaging deeply at
play, they rather shunned all occasions of gaming,
and directed their attention to gallantry, in
which our hero shone unrivalled. His external
qualifications, exclusive of any other merit, were
strong enough to captivate the common run of
the female sex; and these, reinforced with a
sprightliness of conversation, and a most insinuating 

address, became irresistible, even by
those who were fortified with pride, caution or
indifference. But, among all the nymphs of this
gay place, he did not meet with one object that
disputed the empire of his heart with Emilia; 
and therefore he divided his attachment according
to the suggestions of vanity and whim; so that,
before he had resided a fortnight at the Bath, he
had set all the ladies by the ears, and furnished
all the hundred tongues of scandal with full employment. 
The splendor of his appearance excited
the inquiries of envy, which, instead of
discovering any circumstance to his prejudice,
was cursed with the information of his being a
young gentleman of a good family, and heir to
an immense fortune. 
The countenance of some of his quality-friends,
who arrived at Bath, confirmed this
piece of intelligence: upon which, his acquaintance
was courted and cultivated with great assiduity; 
and he met with such advances from some
of the fair sex, as rendered him extremely fortunate
in his amours. Nor was his friend Godfrey
a stranger to favours of the same kind; his accomplishments
were exactly calculated for the
meridian of female taste; and with certain individuals
of that sex, his muscular frame, and the
robust connection of his limbs, were more attractive
than the delicate proportions of his companion. 
He accordingly reigned paramount among
those inamorata's who were turned of thirty,
without being under the necessity of proceeding
by tedious addresses; and was thought to have cooperated
with the waters, in removing the sterility
of certain ladies, who had long undergone
the reproach and disgust of their husbands: while 

Peregrine set up his throne among those who laboured
under the disease of celibacy, from the
pert miss of fifteen, who, with a fluttering heart,
tosses her head, bridles up, and giggles involuntarily
at sight of an handsome young man, to
the staid maiden of twenty-eight, who with a
demure aspect moralizes on the vanity of beauty,
the folly of youth and simplicity of woman, and
expatiates on friendship, benevolence and good
sense, in the stile of a platonic philosopher. 
In such a diversity of dispositions, his conquests
were attended with all the heart-burnings, animosities
and turmoils of jealousy and spite. The
younger class took all opportunities of mortifying
their seniors in public, by treating them with that
indignity which (contrary to the general privilege
of age) is by the consent and connivance of mankind,
levelled against those who have the misfortune
to come under the denomination of old
maids; and these last retorted their hostilities in
the private machinations of slander, supported by
experience and subtility of invention. Not one
day passed, in which some new story did not circulate,
to the prejudice of one or other of those
rivals. 
If our hero, in the long-room, chanced to
quit one of the moralists, with whom he had
been engaged in conversation, he was immediately
accosted by a number of the opposite faction,
who, with ironical smiles, upbraided him with
cruelty to the poor lady he had left, exhorted
him to have compassion on her sufferings, and
turning their eyes towards the object of their intercession,
broke forth into an universal peal of
laughter. On the other hand, when Peregrine,
in consequence of having danced with one of the 

minors over-night, visited her in the morning,
the Platonists immediately laid hold on the occasion,
tasked their imaginations, associated ideas,
and in sage insinuations retailed a thousand circumstances
of the interview, which never had
any foundation in truth. They observed, that
if girls are determined to behave with such indiscretion,
they must lay their accounts with incurring
the censure of the world; that she in
question, was old enough to act more circumspectly; 
and wondered that her mother would
permit any young fellow to approach the chamber,
while her daughter was in naked bed. As
for the servant's peeping through the key-hole, to
be sure it was an unlucky accident; but people
ought to be upon their guard against such curiosity,
and give their domestics no cause to employ
their penetration. These, and other such reflections,
were occasionally whispered as secrets
among those who were known to be communicative; 
so that, in a few hours, it became the
general topic of discourse; and as it had been divulged
under injunctions of secrecy, it was almost
impossible to trace the scandal to its origin; because
every person concerned, must have promulgated
her own breach of trust, in discovering
her author of the report. 
Peregrine, instead of allaying, rather exasperated
this contention, by an artful distribution
of his attention among the competitors; well
knowing, that should his regard be converged into
one point, he would soon forfeit the pleasure he
enjoyed, in seeing them at variance; for both
parties would join against the common enemy,
and his favourite would be persecuted by the
whole coalition. He perceived, that among the 

secret agents of scandal, none were so busy as
the physicians, a class of animals who live in this
place, like so many ravens hovering about a carcase,
and even ply for employment, like scullers
at Hungerford-stairs. The greatest part of them
have correspondents in London, who make it
their business to inquire into the history, character,
and distemper of every one that repairs to
Bath, for the benefit of the waters; and if they
cannot procure interest to recommend their medical
friends to these patients, before they set
out, they at least furnish them with a previous
account of what they could collect, that their
correspondents may use this intelligence for their
own advantage. By these means, and the assistance
of flattery and assurance, they often insinuate
themselves into the acquaintance of strangers,
and by consulting their dispositions, become
necessary and subservient to their prevailing passions. 
By their connexion with apothecaries and
nurses, they are informed of all the private occurrences
in each family; and therefore, enabled
to gratify the rancour of malice, amuse the spleen
of peevish indisposition, and entertain the eagerness
of impertinent curiosity. 
In the course of these occupations, which frequently
affected the reputation of our two adventurers,
this whole body fell under the displeasure
of our hero, who, after divers consultations
with his friend, concerted a stratagem,
which was practised upon the faculty in this manner. 
Among those who frequented the pumproom,
was an old officer, whose temper, naturally
impatient, was, by repeated attacks of the
gout, which had almost deprived him of the use
of his limbs, sublimated into a remarkable degree 

of virulence and perverseness: he imputed the
inveteracy of his distemper to the male practice
of a surgeon who had administered to him, while
he laboured under the consequences of an unfortunate
amour; and this supposition had inspired
him with an insurmountable antipathy to all the
professors of the medical art, which was more
and more confirmed by the information of a friend
at London, who had told him, that it was a
common practice among the physicians at Bath,
to dissuade their patients from drinking the water,
that the cure, and of consequence their attendance,
might be the longer protracted. 
Thus prepossessed, he had come to Bath, and,
conformable to a few general instructions he had
received, used the waters without any farther
direction, taking all occasions of manifesting his
hatred and contempt of the sons of Ã†sculapius,
both by speech and gesticulations, and even by
pursuing a regimen quite contrary to that which
he knew they prescribed to others, who seemed
to be exactly in his condition. But he did not
find his account in this method, how successful
soever it may have been in other cases. His
complaints, instead of vanishing, were every day
more and more enraged; and at length he was
confined to his bed, where he lay blaspheming
from morn to night, and from night to morn,
though still more determined than ever to adhere
to his former maxims. 
In the midst of his torture, which was become
the common joke of the town, being circulated
through the industry of the physicians, who triumphed
in his disaster; Peregrine, by means of
Mr. Pipes, employed a country-fellow, who had
come to market, to run with great haste, early 

one morning, to the lodgings of all the doctors
in town, and desire them to attend the colonel
with all imaginable dispatch. In consequence of
this summons, the whole faculty put themselves
in motion; and three of the foremost arriving at
the same instant of time, far from complimenting
one another with the door, each separately essayed
to enter, and the whole triumvirate stuck in the
passage. While they remained thus wedged together,
they descried two of their brethren posting
towards the same goal, with all the speed that
God had enabled them to exert; upon which
they came to a parley, and agreed to stand by one
another. This covenant being made, they disentangled
themselves, and inquiring about the patient,
were told by the servant, that he had just
fallen asleep. 
Having received this intelligence, they took
possession of his anti-chamber, and shut the
door, while the rest of the tribe posted themselves
on the outside, as they arrived; so that
the whole passage was filled, from the top of the
stair-case to the street-door; and the people of
the house, together with the colonel's servant,
struck dumb with astonishment. The three
leaders of this learned gang had no sooner made
their lodgment good, than they began to consult
about the patient's malady, which every one of
them pretended to have considered with great
care and assiduity. The first who gave his opinion,
said, the distemper was an obstinate Arthritis; 
the second affirmed, that it was no other
than a confirmed pox; and the third swore it
was an inveterate scurvy. This diversity of opinions
was supported by a variety of quotations
from medical authors, ancient as well as modern: 

but these were not of sufficient authority, or at
least not explicit enough to decide the dispute; 
for there are many schisms in medicine, as well
as in religion, and each sect can quote the fathers,
in support of the tenets they profess. In short,
the contention rose to such a pitch of clamour,
as not only alarmed their brethren on the stair,
but also waked the patient from the first nap he
had enjoyed in the space of ten whole days. Had
it been simply waking, he would have been obliged
to them for the noise that disturbed him; 
for, in that case, he would have been relieved
from the tortures of hell-fire, to which, in his
dream, he fancied himself exposed: but this
dreadful vision had been the result of that impression
which was made upon his brain, by the
intolerable anguish of his joints; so that, when
he waked, the pain, instead of being allayed,
was rather aggravated by a greater acuteness of
sensation; and the confused vociferation in the
next room, invading his ears at the same time,
he began to think his dream was realized; and,
in the pangs of despair, applied himself to a bell
that stood by his bed-side, which he rung with
great violence and perseverance. 
This alarm put an immediate stop to the disputation
of the three doctors, who, upon this
notice of his being awake, rushed into his chamber
without ceremony; and each seizing an arm,
the third made the like application to one of his
temples. Before the patient could recollect himself
from the amazement which had laid hold on
him, at this unexpected irruption, the room was
filled by the rest of the faculty, who followed
the servant that entered, in obedience to his
master's call; and the bed was, in a moment, surrounded 

by these gaunt ministers of death. The
colonel, seeing himself beset with such an assemblage
of solemn visages and figures, which he
had always considered with the utmost detestation
and abhorrence, was incensed to a most inexpressible
degree of indignation; and so inspirited
by his rage, that though his tongue denied its office,
his other limbs performed their function; 
he disengaged himself from the triumvirate, who
had taken possession of his body, sprung out of
bed with incredible agility, and seizing one of his
crutches, applied it so effectually to one of the
three, just as he stooped to examine the patient's
water, that his tye-periwig dropped into the pot,
while he himself fell motionless on the floor. 
This significant explanation disconcerted the
whole fraternity; every man turned his face, as
if it were by instinct, towards the door; and the
retreat of the community being obstructed by the
efforts of individuals, confusion and tumultuous
uproar ensued: for the colonel, far from limiting
his prowess to the first exploit, handled his weapon
with astonishing vigour and dexterity, without
respect of persons; so that few or none of
them had escaped without marks of his displeasure,
when his spirits failed, and he sunk down
again, quite exhausted, on his bed. Favoured
by this respite, the discomfited faculty collected
their hats and wigs, which had fallen off in the
fray; and perceiving the assailant too much enfeebled
to renew the attack, set up their throats
together, and loudly threatened to prosecute him
severely for such an outrageous assault. 
By this time, the landlord had interposed; 
and inquiring into the cause of the disturbance,
was informed of what had happened by the complainants, 

who, at the same time, giving him to
understand, that they had been severally summoned
to attend the colonel that morning, he
assured them, that they had been imposed upon
by some wag; for his lodger had never dream'd
of consulting any one of their profession. 
Thunderstruck at this declaration, the general
clamour instantaneously ceased; and each, in
particular, at once comprehending the nature of
the joke, they sneaked silently off with the loss
they had sustained, in unutterable shame and mortification; 
while Peregrine and his friend, who
took care to be passing that way by accident,
made a full stop at sight of such an extraordinary
efflux, and enjoyed the countenance and condition
of every one as he appeared: nay, even
made up to some of those who seemed most affected
with their situation, and mischievously tormented
them with questions touching this unusual
congregation; then, in consequence of the
information they received from the landlord and
the colonel's valet, subjected the sufferers to the
ridicule of all the company in town. As it would
have been impossible for the authors of this farce
to keep themselves concealed from the indefatigable
inquiries of the physicians, they made no
secret of their having directed the whole; though
they took care to own it in such an ambiguous
manner, as afforded no handle of prosecution.
