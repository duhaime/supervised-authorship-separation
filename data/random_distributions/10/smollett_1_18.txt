The step-dame's suspicions being awakened, she
lays a snare for our adventurer, from which
he is delivered by the interposition of his
good genius. 
Though the husband swallowed the bait,
without further inquiry, the penetration
of the wife was not so easily deceived: that
same dialogue in Wilhelmina's apartment, far
from allaying, rather inflamed her suspicion,
because , in the like emergency, she herself had
once profited by the same, or nearly the same
contrivance. Without communicating her
doubts to the father, she resolved to double
her attention to the daughter's future conduct,
and keep such a strict eye over the behaviour
of our gallant, that he should find it
very difficult, if not impossible, to elude her
observation. For this purpose, she took into
her pay an old maiden, of the right sour disposition,
who lived in an house opposite to her
own, and directed her to follow the young lady
in all her out-goings, whenever she should
receive from the window a certain signal,
which the mother-in law agreed to make for
the occasion. It was not long before this
scheme succeeded to her wish: the door of
communication, betwixt Wilhelmina's apartment
and the stair case, being nailed up by the 

jeweller's express order, our adventurer was
altogether deprived of those opportunities he
had hitherto enjoyed; and was not at all mortified
to find himself so restricted, in a correspondence
which began to be tiresome and disagreeable:
but the case was far otherwise with
his Dulcinea, whose passion, the more it was
thwarted, raged with greater violence, like a
fire, that from the attempts that are made to
extinguish it, gathers greater force, and flames
with double fury. 
Upon the second day of her misfortune, she
had written a very tender billet, lamenting her
unhappiness, in being deprived of those meetings
which constituted the chief joy of her life,
and intreating him to contrive some means of
renewing the delicious commerce in an unsuspected
place. This intimation she proposed to
convey privately into the hand of her lover,
during his next visit to the family; but both
were so narrowly eyed by the mother, that she
found the execution of her design impracticable; 
and next forenoon, on pretence of going
to church, repaired to the house of a companion,
who being also her confidante, undertook
to deliver the billet with her own hand. 
The she-dragon employed by her mother, in
obedience to the sign, which was displayed
from the window, immediately put on her
veil, and followed Wilhelmina at a distance,
until she saw her fairly housed: she would
not even then return from her excursion,
but hovered about in sight of the door, with
a view of making further observations: in
less than five minutes after, the young lady disappeared,
the scout perceived her coming out, 

accompanied by her comerade, from whom she
instantly parted, and bent her way towards the
church in good earnest, while the other steered
her course in another direction. The
duenna, after a moment's suspence and consideration,
divined the true cause of this short
visit, and resolved to watch the motions of the
confidante, whom she traced to the academy
in which our hero lodged, and from which
she saw her return, after the supposed message
was delivered. 
Fraught with this intelligence, the rancorous
understrapper, hied her home to the
jeweller's wife, and made a faithful recital of
what she had seen; communicating at the same
time, her own conjectures on the subject. Her
employer was equally astonished and incensed
at this information: she was seized with all
that frenzy which takes possession of a slighted
woman, when she finds herself supplanted by
a detested rival; and in the first transports of
her indignation, devoted them as sacrifices to
her vengeance: nor was her surprise so much
the effect of his dissimulation, as of his want
of taste and discernment. She inveighed against
him, not as the most treacherous lover,
but as the most abject wretch, in courting the
smiles of such an aukward dowdy, while he
enjoyed the favours of a woman, who had
numbered princes in the train of her admirers. 
For the brilliancy of her attractions, such as
they at present shone, she appealed to the decision
of her minister, who consulted her own
satisfaction and interest, by flattering the
other's vanity and resentment: and so unaccountable
did the depravity of our hero's 

judgment appear to this conceited dame, that
she began to believe there was some mistake in
the person, and to hope that Wilhelmina's
gallant was not in reality her professed admirer
Mr Fathom, but rather one of his fellow-lodgers,
whose passion he favoured with his
mediation and assistance. 
On this notion, which nothing but meer vanity
could have inspired, in opposition to so
many more weighty presumptions, she took
the resolution of bringing the affair to a fuller
explanation, before she would concert any
measures to the prejudice of our adventurer, and
forthwith dispatched her spy back to his lodgings
to sollicit on the part of Wilhelmina an
immediate answer to the letter he had received. 
This was an expedition with which the
old maiden would have willingly dispensed,
because it was founded upon an uncertainty,
which might be attended with troublesome
consequences; but rather than be the means
of retarding a negotiation, so productive of
that sort of mischief which is particularly agreeable
to all of her tribe, she undertook to
manage and effect the discovery, in full confidence
of her own talents and experience. 
With such a fund of self-sufficiency and instigation,
she repaired to the academy on the
instant, and inquiring for Mr Fathom, was
introduced to his apartment, where she found
him in the very act of writing a billet to the
jeweller's daughter. The artful agent having
asked, with the mysterious air of an expert go-between,
if he had not lately received a message
from a certain young lady; and being answered
in the affirmative, gave him to understand, 

that she herself was a person favoured
with the friendship and confidence of Wilhelmina,
whom she had known from her cradle,
and often dandled on her knee; then in the
genuine stile of a pratling dry-nurse, she launched
out in encomiums on his Dulcinea's beauty
and sweetness of temper, recounting many simple
occurrences of her infancy and childhood; 
and finally, desiring a more circumstantial answer
to that which she had sent to him by her
friend Catherina. In the course of her loquacity,
she had also, according to her instructions,
hinted at the misfortune of the door; 
and on the whole, performed her cue with
such dexterity and discretion, that our politician
was actually over-reached, and having
finished his epistle, committed it to her care,
with many verbal expressions of eternal love
and fidelity to his charming Wilhelmina. 
The messenger doubly rejoiced at her atchievement,
which not only recommended her ministry,
but also gratified her malice, returned
to her principal with great exultation, and delivering
the letter, the reader will easily conceive
the transports of that lady, when she read
the contents of it in these words. 

“Angelic Wilhelmina!
To forget those extatic scenes we have enjoyed
together, or even live without the
continuation of that mutual bliss, were to
quit all title to perception, and resign every
hope of future happiness. No! my charmer,
while my head retains the least spark
of invention, and my heart glows with the resolution 

of a man, our correspondence
shall not be cut off by the machinations of
an envious step-mother, who never had attractions
to inspire a generous passion; and
now that age and wrinkles have destroyed
what little share of beauty she once possessed,
endeavours, like the fiend in paradise, to
blast those joys in others, from which she is
herself eternally excluded. Doubt not, dear
sovereign of my soul! that I will study with
all the eagerness of desiring love, how to
frustrate her malicious intention, and renew
those transporting moments, the remembrance
of which now warms the breast of
your ever constant 
Fathom.” 
Had our hero murdered her father, or left
her a disconsolate widow, by effecting the death
of her dear husband, there might have been a
possibility of her exerting the Christian virtues
of resignation and forgivenness; but such a
personal outrage as that contained in this epistle,
precluded all hope of pardon, and rendered
penitence of no signification. His attrocious
crime being now fully ascertained, this virago
gave a loose to her resentment, which became
so loud and tempestuous, that her informer
shuddered at the storm she had raised, and
began to repent of having communicated the
intelligence which seemed to have such a violent
effect upon her brain. 
She endeavoured, however, to allay the agitation,
by flattering her fancy with the prospect
of revenge, and gradually soothed her into a
state of deliberate ire; during which she determined 

to take ample vengeance on the delinquent. 
In the zenith of her rage, she would
have had immediate recourse to poison or steel,
had she not been diverted from her mortal purpose,
by her counsellor, who represented the
danger of engaging in such violent measures,
and proposed a more secure scheme, in the
execution of which, she would see the perfidious
wretch sufficiently punished, without any
hazard to her own person or reputation. She
advised her to inform the jeweller of Fathom's
efforts, to seduce her conjugal fidelity, and
impart to him a plan, by which he would have
it in his power, to detect our adventurer in the
very act of practising upon her virtue. 
The lady relished her proposal, and actually
resolved to make an assignation with Ferdinand,
as usual, and give notice of the appointment to
her husband, that he might personally discover
the treachery of his pretended friend, and inflict
upon him such chastisement, as the German's
brutal disposition should suggest, when
inflamed by that species of provocation. Had
this project been brought to bear, Ferdinand, in
all likelihood, would have been disqualified
from engaging in any future intrigue; but fate
ordained, that the design should be defeated,
in order to reserve him for more important
occasions. 
Before the circumstances of the plan could
be adjusted, it was his good fortune to meet his
Dulcinea in the street, and in the midst of their
mutual condolance on the interruption they
had suffered in their correspondence, he assured
her, that he would never give his invention
respite, until he should have verified the protestations 

contained in the letter he had delivered
to her discreet agent. This allusion to a
billet she had never received, did not fail to alarm
her fears, and introduce a very mortifying
explanation, in which he so accurately described
the person of the messenger, that she forthwith
comprehended the plot, and communicated
to our hero her sentiments on that subject. 
Though he expressed infinite anxiety and
chagrin at this misfortune, which could not fail
to raise new obstacles to their love, his heart
was a stranger to the uneasiness he affected; 
and rather pleased with the occasion, which
would furnish him with pretences to withdraw
himself gradually, from an intercourse by this
time become equally cloying and unprofitable. 
Being well acquainted with the mother's temperament,
he guessed the present situation of
her thoughts, and concluding she would make
the jeweller a party in her revenge, he resolved
from that moment to discontinue his visits,
and cautiously guard against any future interview
with the lady, whom he had rendered so
implacable. 
It was well for our adventurer, that his
good fortune so seasonably interposed; for that
same day, in the afternoon, he was favoured
with a billet from the jeweller's wife, couched
in the same tender stile she had formerly used,
and importing an earnest desire of seeing him
next day, at the wonted rendezvous. Altho'
his penetration was sufficient to perceive the
drift of this message; or at least, to discern the
risque he should run, in complying with her
request, yet he was willing to be more fully
certified of the truth of his suspicion, and wrote 

an answer to the billet, in which he assured her
that he would repair to the place of appointment,
with all the punctuality of an impatient
lover. Nevertheless, instead of performing
this promise, he, in the morning, took post in
a public house opposite to the place of assignation,
in order to reconnoitre the ground, and
about noon had the pleasure of seeing the German
wrapped in a cloak, enter the door of his
wife's she-friend, though the appointment was
fixed at five in the evening. Fathom blessed
his good angel, for having conducted him clear
of this conspiracy, and kept his station with
great tranquillity, till the hour of meeting,
when he beheld his enraged Thalestris take the
same route, and enjoyed her disappointment
with ineffable satisfaction. 
Thus favoured with a pretext, he took his
leave of her, in a letter, giving her to understand,
that he was no stranger to the barbarous
snare she had laid for him; and upbraiding
her with having made such an ungrateful return
for all his tenderness and attachment. 
She was not backward in conveying a reply to
this expostulation, which seemed to have been
dictated in all the distraction of a proud woman,
who fees her vengeance baffled, as well as
her love disdained. Her letter was nothing
but a succession of reproaches, menaces, and
incoherent execrations. She taxed him with
knavery, insensibility and dissimulation; imprecated
a thousand curses upon his head, and
threatened not only to persecute his life with
all the arts that hell and malice could inspire,
but also to wound him in the person of her
daughter-in-law, who should be inclosed for 

life in a convent, where she would have leisure
to repent of those loose and disorderly
practices, which he had taught her to commit,
and of which she could not pretend innocence,
as they had it in their power to confront her
with the evidence of her lover's own confession. 
Yet all this denunciation was qualified
with an alternative, by which he was given to
understand, that the gates of mercy were still
open, and that penitence was capable of washing
out the deepest stain of guilt. 
Ferdinand read the whole remonstrance with
great composure and moderation, and was content
to incur the hazard of her hate, rather
than put her to the trouble of making such an
effort of generosity, as would induce her to
forgive the heinous offence he had committed; 
nor did his apprehension for Wilhelmina in
the least influence his behaviour on this occasion:
so zealous was he for her spiritual concerns,
that he would have been glad to hear
she had actually taken the veil; but he knew
such a step was not at all agreeable to her disposition,
and that no violence would be offered
to her inclinations on that score, unless her
step-mother should communicate to the father
that letter of Fathom which she had intercepted,
and by which the German would be convinced
of his daughter's backsliding; but this
measure, he rightly supposed, the wife would
not venture to take, lest the husband, instead
of taking her advice, touching the young lady,
should seek to compromise the affair, by offering
her in marriage to her debaucher; a proffer,
which, if accepted, would overwhelm the
mother with vexation and despair. He therefore 

chose to trust to the effects of lenient
time, which he hoped would gradually weaken
the resentment of this Penthesilea, and dissolve
his connection with the other parts of the family,
from which he longed to be totally
detached. 
How well soever he might have succeeded in
his attempts to shake off the yoke of the mother,
who by her situation in life was restrained
from prosecuting those measures her resentment
had planned against his fortitude and indifference; 
he would have found greater difficulty
than he had foreseen, in disengaging
himself from the daughter, whose affection he
had won under the most solemn professions of
honour and fidelity; and who, now she was
debarred of his company and conversation, and
in danger of losing him for ever, had actually
taken the resolution of disclosing the amour
to her father, that he might interpose in behalf
of her peace and reputation, and secure her
happiness by the sanction of the church.
