After divers unsuccessful efforts, he has recourse
to the matrimonial noose. 
Chancing to meet with one of his acquaintance
at a certain coffeehouse, the
discourse turned upon the characters of Mankind,
when, among other oddities, his friend
brought upon the carpet a certain old gentlewoman
of such a rapacious disposition, that
like a jack-daw, she never beheld any metalline
substance without an inclination, and even an
effort to secrete it for her own use and contemplation:
nor was this infirmity originally
produced from indigence, inasmuch as her circumstances
had been always affluent, and she
was now possessed of a considerable sum of money
in the funds; notwithstanding which, the
avarice of her nature tempted her to let lodgings
though few people could live under the 

same roof with such an orignal, who rather
than be idle, had often filched pieces of her
own plate, and charged her servants with the
theft, or hinted suspicion of her lodgers. Fathom,
struck with the description, soon perceived
how this woman's disease might be converted
to his advantage; and after having obtained
sufficient intelligence, on pretence of satisfying
his curiosity, he visited the widow, in
consequence of a bill at her door, and actually
hired an apartment in her house, whither he
forthwith repaired with his inamorata. It was
not long before he perceived, that his landlady's
character had not been misrepresented; he fed
her distemper with divers inconsiderable
trinkets, such as copper medals, cork screws,
odd buckles, and a paultry seal set in silver,
which were, at different times, laid as baits for
her infirmity, and always convey'd away with
remarkable eagerness, which he and his Dulcinea
took pleasure in observing from an unsuspected
place. Thus confirmed in his
opinion, he, at length, took an opportunity of
exposing a metal watch that belonged to his
mistress, and saw it seized, with great satisfaction,
in the absence of his help-mate, who
had gone abroad on purpose. According to
instruction, she soon returned, and began to
raise a terrible clamour about the loss of her
watch; upon which she was condoled by her
landlady, who seemed to doubt the integrity
of the maid, and even proposed, that Mrs
Fathom should apply to some justice of the
peace, for a warrant to search the servant's
trunk. The lady thanked her for the good
advice, in compliance with which, she had immediate
recourse to a magistrate, who granted 

a search warrant, not against the maid, but the
mistress; and she, in a little time, returned
with the constable at her back. 
These precautions being taken, doctor Fathom
desired a private conference with the old
gentlewoman, in which he gave her to understand,
that he had undoubted proofs of her
having secreted, not only the watch, but also
several other odd things, of less consequence,
which he had lost since his residence in her
house: he then shewed the warrant he had obtained
against her, and asked if she had any
thing to offer, why the constable should not do
his duty. Inexpressible were the anguish and
confusion of the defendant, when she found
herself thus entrapped, and reflected that she
was on the point of being detected of felony; 
for she at once concluded, that the snare was
laid for her, and knew, that the officer of justice
would certainly find the unlucky watch in one
of the drawers of her scrutore. 
Tortured with these suggestions, afraid of
public disgrace, and dreading the consequence
of legal conviction, she fell on her knees before
the injured Fathom, and, after having imputed
her crime to the temptations of necessity, implored
his compassion, promised to restore the
watch, and every thing she had taken, and
begged he would dismiss the constable, that
her reputation might not suffer in the eye of
the world. 
Ferdinand, with a severity of countenance
purposely assumed, observed, that were she
really indigent, he had charity enough to forgive
what she had done; but, as he knew her
circumstances were opulent, he looked upon
this excuse as an aggravation of her guilt, which 

was certainly the effect of a vicious inclination,
and he was therefore determined to prosecute
her with the utmost severity of the law, as an
example and terror to others, who might be
infected with the same evil disposition. Finding
him deaf to all her tears and intreaties, she
changed the note, and offered him one hundred
guineas, if he would compromise the affair,
and drop the prosecution, so as that her character
should sustain no damage; after much
argumentation, he consented to accept of double
the sum, which being instantly paid in East-India
bonds, doctor Fathom told the constable, that
the watch was found; and for once her reputation
was patched up. This seasonable,
supply enabled our hero to stand trial with his
adversary, who was nonsuited, and also to
mend his external appearance, which of late
had not been extremely magnificent, 
Soon after this gleam of good fortune, a
tradesman, to whom he was considerably indebted,
seeing no other probable means to recover
his money, introduced Fathom to the
acquaintance of a young widow who lodged at
his house, and was said to be in possession of a
considerable fortune. Considering the steps
that were taken, it would have been almost impossible
for him to miscarry in his addresses:
the lady had been bred in the country, was
unacquainted with the world, and of a very
sanguine disposition, which her short trial of
matrimony had not served to cool. Our adventurer
was instructed to call at the tradesman's
house, as if by accident, at an appointed
time, when the widow was drinking tea with
her landlady: on these occasions he always
behaved to admiration. She liked his person, 

and praised his politeness, good humour, and
good sense: his confederates extolled him as a
prodigy of learning, taste, and good nature:
they likewise represented him as a person on the
eve of eclipsing all his competitors in physick:
an acquaintance and intimacy soon ensued, nor
was he restricted in point of opportunity. In
a word, he succeeded in his endeavours, and
one evening, on pretence of attending her to
the play, he accompanied her to the Fleet, where
they were married, in presence of the tradesman
and his wife, who were of the party. 
This grand affair being accomplished to his
satisfaction, he next day, visited her brother,
who was a counsellor of the Temple, to make
him acquainted with the step his sister had taken; 
and though the lawyer was not a little
mortified, to find she had made such a clandestine
match, he behaved civilly to his new brother-in-law,
and gave him to understand, that
his wife's fortune consisted of a jointure of one
hundred and fifty pounds a year, and fifteen
hundred pounds bequeathed to her during her
widowhood, by her own father, who had taken
the precaution of settling it in the hands of
trustees, in such a manner as that any husband
she might afterwards espouse, should be restricted
from encroaching upon the capital, which
was reserved for the benefit of her heirs. This
intimation was far from being agreeable to our
hero, who had been informed, that this sum
was absolutely at the lady's disposal, and had
actually destined the greatest part of it for the
payment of his debts, for defraying the expence
of furnishing an elegant house, and setting up a
new equipage. 
Notwithstanding this disappointment, he resolved 

to carry on his plan, upon the credit of
his marriage, which was published in a very
pompous article of the news papers; a chariot
was bespoke, a ready furnished house immediately
taken, and doctor Fathom began to re-appear
in all his former splendor. 
His good friend the empirick, alarmed at
this event, which not only raised our adventurer
into the sphere of a dangerous rival, but
also furnished him with means to revenge the
ill office he had sustained at his hands, on the
adventure of the former match; for, by this
time, Fathom had given him some hints, importing,
that he was not ignorant of his treacherous
behaviour: roused, I say, by these considerations,
he employed one of his emissaries,
who had some knowledge of Fathom's brother-in-law,
to prejudice him against our adventurer,
whom he represented as a needy sharper, not
only overwhelmed with debt and disgrace, but
likewise previously married to a poor woman,
who was prevented by nothing but want, from
seeking redress at law. To confirm these assertions,
he gave him a detail of Fathom's incumbrances,
which he had learned for the purpose,
and even brought the counsellor in company
with the person who had lived with our hero
before marriage, and who was so much incensed
at her abrupt dismission, that she did not scruple
to corroborate these allegations of the informer. 
The lawyer, startled at this intelligence, set
on foot a minute inquiry into the life and conversation
of the doctor, which turned out so
little to the advantage of his character and circumstances,
that he resolved, if possible, to disunite
him from his family, and as a previous 

step, repeated to his sister, all that he had heard
to the prejudice of her husband, not forgetting
to produce the evidence of his mistress, who
laid claim to him by a prior title, which, she
pretended, could be proved by the testimony
of the clergyman who joined them. Such an
explanation could not fail to inflame the resentment
of the injured wife, who, at the very first
opportunity, giving a loose to the impetuosity
of her temper, upbraided our hero with the
most bitter invectives for his perfidious dealing. 
Ferdinand, conscious of his own innocence,
which he had not always to plead, far from attempting
to soothe her indignation, assumed the
authority and prerogative of an husband, and
sharply reprehended her for her credulity and
indecent warmth. This rebuke, instead of silencing,
gave new spirit and volubility to her
reproaches, in the course of which, she plainly
taxed him with want of honesty and affection,
and said, that though his pretence was love, his
aim was no other than a base design upon her
fortune. 
Fathom, stung with these accusations, which
he really did not deserve, replied with uncommon
heat, and charged her,in his turn, with
want of sincerity and candour, in the false account
she had given of that same fortune, before
marriage: he even magnified his own condescension,
in surrendering his liberty to a woman,
who had so little to recommend her to
the addresses of the other sex; a reflection
which provoked this mild creature to such a
degree of animosity, that, forgetting her duty
and allegiance, she lent him a box on the ear,
with such energy as made his eyes water; and
he, for the honour of his manhood and sovereignty, 

having washed her face with a dish of
tea, withdrew abruptly, to a coffee house in the
neighbourhood, where he had not long remained,
when his passion subsided, and he then saw
the expediency of an immediate reconciliation,
which he resolved to purchase, even at the expence
of a submission. 
It was pity that such a salutary resolution had
not been sooner taken: for when he returned
to his own house, he understood, that Mrs.
Fathom had gone abroad in an hackney coach:
and upon examining her apartment, in lieu of
her cloaths and trinkets, which she had removed
with admirable dexterity and dispatch, he
found this billet in one of the drawers of her
buroe.  “Sir, being convinced that you are a
cheat and an impostor, I have withdrawn myself
from your cruelty and machinations, with a
view to sollicit the protection of the law: and
I doubt not but I shall soon be able to prove,
that you have no just title to, or demand upon
the person or effects of the unfortunate Sarah
Muddy.” 
The time had been when Mr Fathom would
have allowed Mrs Muddy to refine at her leisure,
and blessed God for his happy deliverance; 
but at present the case was quite altered. 
Smarting as he was, from the expence of law
suits, he dreaded a prosecution for bigamy
which (though he had justice on his side) he
knew he could not of himself support: besides,
all his other schemes of life were frustrated
by this unlucky elopement: he therefore
speedily determined to anticipate, as much
as in him lay, the malice of his enemies, and
to obtain, without delay, authentic documents
of his marriage. With this view he hastened 

to the house of the tradesman, who, with his
wife, had been witness to the ceremony and
consummation; and, in order to interest them
the more warmly in his cause, made a pathetic
recital of this unhappy breach, in which
he had suffered such injury and insult: but all
his rhetoric would not avail; Mrs Muddy had
been beforehand with him, and proved the better
orator of the two; for she had assailed this
honest couple with such tropes and figures of
eloquence, as were altogether irresistible. Nevertheless,
they heard our hero, to an end,
with great patience: then the wife, who was
the common mouth, upon all such occasions,
contracting her features into a very formal
disposition, “I'll assure you, said she, doctor
Fathom, my husband and I have been in a very
great terrification and numbplush, to hear
such bad things of a person, whom, as one
may say, we thought a worthy gentleman, and
were ready to serve at all times, by day and by
night, as the saying is; and besides, for all
that, you know, and God knows, as we are
dustrious people, and work hard for what we
get, and we have served gentlemen to our
own harm, whereby my husband was last Tuesday
served with a siserary, being that he was
bound for an officer that ran away: and I said
to my husband, Timothy, says I, 'tis a very
hard thing for one to ruin one's self for stranger
people. There's doctor Fathom, says I,
his account comes to nine and forty pounds
seven shillings and four-pence half-penny:
and you know, doctor, that was before your
last bill began: but, howsomever, little did I
think, as how a gentleman of your learning, 

would go to deceive a poor gentlewoman,
when you had another wife alive.” 
In vain did our adventurer endeavour to vindicate
himself from this aspersion; the good
woman, like a great many modern disputants,
proceeded with her declamation, without
seeming to hear what was said on the other
side of the question; and the husband was altogether
neutral. At length, Ferdinand finding
all his protestations ineffectual, “Well,
said he, though you are resolved, I see, to
discredit all that I can say in opposition to that
scandalous slander, of which I can easily acquit
myself in a court of justice, surely you
will not refuse to grant me a certificate, signifying,
that you were present at the ceremony
of my marriage with this unhappy woman.” 
“You shall excuse us; (replied the female orator)
people cannot be too wary in signing their
names, in this wicked world; many a one has
been brought to ruination by signing his name,
and my husband shall not, with my good will,
draw himself into such a primmineery.” 
Fathom, alarm'd at this refusal, earnestly
argued against the inhumanity and injustice of
it, appealing to their own consciences for the
reasonableness of his proposal; but, from the
evasive answers of the wife, he had reason to
believe, that, long before the time of trial,
they would take care to have forgotten the
whole transaction. 
Though he was equally confounded and incensed
at this instance of their perfidy, he
durst not manifest his indignation, conscious
of the advantage they had over him in divers
respects; but repaired, without loss of time, to
the lodging of the clergyman who had noosed 

him, resolved to consult his register, and
secure his evidence. Here too his evil genius
had got the start of him, for the worthy ecclesiastic
not only could not recollect his features,
or find his name in the register; but,
when importuned by his pressing remonstrances,
took umbrage at the freedom of his behaviour,
and threatened, if he would not immediately
take himself away, to raise the posse
of the Fleet, for the safety of his own person. 
Rather than put the pastor to the trouble of
alarming his flock, he retreated with a heavy
heart, and went in quest of his mistress, whom
he had dismissed at his marriage, in hopes of
effecting a reconciliation, and preventing her
from joining in the conspiracy against him; 
but, alas, he met with such a reception, as he
had reason to expect from a slighted woman,
who had never felt any real attachment for his
person. She did not upbraid him with his
cruelty, in leaving her as a mistress; but, with
a species of effrontery, never enough to be admired,
reproached him with his villainy, in
abandoning her, who was his true and lawful
wife, to go and ruin a poor gentlewoman, by
whose fortune he had been allured. 
When he attempted to expostulate with this
virago, upon the barbarity of this assertion, she
very prudently declined engaging in private
conversation with such an artful and wicked
man, and calling up the people of the house,
insisted upon his being conducted to the door.
