My dear Sir

Will you have the kindness to accept from me
the accompanying sett of my father's novels having a short biography
annexed and must apologize for their not being in better order,
but they are believed to be the only uniform edition ever printed
in the United States
 

Yours truly
Wm Linn Brown
 To Mr Ferdianand J. Dreer
