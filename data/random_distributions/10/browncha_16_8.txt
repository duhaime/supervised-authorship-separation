Some time had elap&longs;ed when there happened
another occurrence, &longs;till more remarkable. Pleyel,
on his return from Europe, brought information of
con&longs;iderable importance to my brother. My ancestors
were noble Saxons, and po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;ed large domains
in Lu&longs;atia. The Pru&longs;&longs;ian wars had de&longs;troyed
tho&longs;e per&longs;ons who&longs;e right to the&longs;e e&longs;tates precluded
my brother's. Pleyel had been exact in his
inquiries, and had di&longs;covered that, by the law
of male-primogeniture, my brother's claims were
&longs;uperior to tho&longs;e of any other per&longs;on now living.
Nothing was wanting but his pre&longs;ence in that
country, and a legal application to e&longs;tabli&longs;h this
claim.
Pleyel &longs;trenuou&longs;ly recommended this mea&longs;ure.
The advantages he thought attending it were numerous,
and it would argue the utmo&longs;t folly to
neglect them. Contrary to his expectation he
found my brother aver&longs;e to the &longs;cheme. Slight efforts,
he, at fir&longs;t, thought would &longs;ubdue his reluctance;
but he found this aver&longs;ion by no means
&longs;light. The intere&longs;t that he took in the happine&longs;s
of his friend and his &longs;i&longs;ter, and his own partiality
to the Saxon &longs;oil, from which he had likewi&longs;e
&longs;prung, and where he had &longs;pen; &longs;everal years of
his youth, made him redouble his exertions to win
Wieland's con&longs;ent. For this end he employed every
argument that his invention could &longs;ugge&longs;t. He painted,
in attractive colours, the &longs;tate of manners and
government in that country, the &longs;ecurity of civil
rights, and the freedom of religious &longs;entiments. He




dwelt on the privileges of wealth and rank, and
drew from the &longs;ervile condition of one cla&longs;s, an
argument in favor of his &longs;cheme, &longs;ince the revenue
and power annexed to a German principality afford
&longs;o large a field for benevolence. The evil
flowing from this power, in malignant hands, was
proportioned to the good that would ari&longs;e from the
virtuous u&longs;e of it. Hence, Wieland, in forbearing
to claim his own, withheld all the po&longs;itive felicity
that would accrue to his va&longs;&longs;als from his &longs;ucce&longs;s,
and hazarded all the mi&longs;ery that would redound
from a le&longs;s enlightened proprietor.
It was ea&longs;y for my brother to repel the&longs;e arguments,
and to &longs;hew that no &longs;pot on the globe enjoyed
equal &longs;ecurity and liberty to that which he
at pre&longs;ent inhabited. That if the Saxons had nothing
to fear from mi&longs;-government, the external
cau&longs;es of havoc and alarm were numerous and
manife&longs;t. The recent deva&longs;tations committed by
the Pru&longs;&longs;ians furni&longs;hed a &longs;pecimen of the&longs;e. The
horrors of war would always impend over them,
till Germany were &longs;eized and divided by Au&longs;trian
and Pru&longs;&longs;ian tyrants; an event which he &longs;trongly
&longs;u&longs;pected was at no great di&longs;tance. But &longs;etting
the&longs;e con&longs;iderations a&longs;ide, was it laudable to gra&longs;p
at wealth and power even when they were within
our reach? Were not the&longs;e the two great &longs;ources
of depravity? What &longs;ecurity had he, that in this
change of place and condition, he &longs;hould not degenerate
into a tyrant and voluptuary? Power
and riches were chiefly to be dreaded on account of
their tendency to deprave the po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;or. He held
them in abhorrence, not only as in&longs;truments of
mi&longs;ery to others, but to him on whom they were
con&longs;erred. Be&longs;ides, riches were comparative, and
was he not rich already? He lived at pre&longs;ent in the




bo&longs;om of &longs;ecurity and luxury. All the in&longs;truments
of plea&longs;ure, on which his rea&longs;on or imagination
&longs;et any value, were within his reach. But the&longs;e
he mu&longs;t forego, for the &longs;ake of advantages which,
whatever were their value, were as yet uncertain.
In pur&longs;uit of an imaginary addition to his wealth,
he mu&longs;t reduce him&longs;elf to poverty, he mu&longs;t exchange
pre&longs;ent certainties for what was di&longs;tant and contingent;
for who knows not that the law is a &longs;y&longs;tem
of expence, delay and uncertainty? If he &longs;hould
embrace this &longs;cheme, it would lay him under the
nece&longs;&longs;ity of making a voyage to Europe, and remaining
for a certain period, &longs;eparate from his
family. He mu&longs;t undergo the perils and discomforts
of the ocean; he mu&longs;t dive&longs;t him&longs;elf of all
dome&longs;tic plea&longs;ures; he mu&longs;t deprive his wi&longs;e of her
companion, and his children of a father and instructor,
and all for what? For the ambiguous advantages
which overgrown wealth and flagitious tyranny
have to be&longs;tow? For a precarious po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;ion in a land
of turbulence and war? Advantages, which will
not certainly be gained, and of which the acquistion,
if it were &longs;ure, is nece&longs;&longs;arily di&longs;tant.
Pleyel was enamoured of his &longs;cheme on account
of its intrin&longs;ic benefits, but, likewi&longs;e, for other reasons.
His abode at Leip&longs;ig made that country
appear to him like home. He was connected with
this place by many &longs;ocial ties. While there he had
not e&longs;caped the amorous contagion. But the lady,
though her heart was impre&longs;&longs;ed in his favor, was
compelled to be&longs;tow her hand upon another. Death
had removed this impediment, and he was now invited
by the lady her&longs;elf to return. This he was
of cour&longs;e determined to do, but was anxious to obtain
the company of Wieland; he could not bear
to think of an eternal &longs;eparation from his pre&longs;ent




a&longs;&longs;ociates. Their intere&longs;t, he thought, would be no
le&longs;s promoted by the change than his own. Hence
he was importunate and indefatigable in his arguments
and &longs;olicitations.
He knew that he could not hope for mine or his
&longs;i&longs;ter's ready concurrence in this &longs;cheme. Should
the &longs;ubject be mentioned to us, we &longs;hould league
our efforts again&longs;t him, and &longs;trengthen that reluctance
in Wieland which already was &longs;ufficiently
difficult to conquer. He, therefore, anxiou&longs;ly concealed
from us his purpo&longs;e. If Wieland were
previou&longs;ly enli&longs;ted in his cau&longs;e, he would find it a
le&longs;s difficult ta&longs;k to overcome our aver&longs;ion. My
brother was &longs;ilent on this &longs;ubject, becau&longs;e he believed
him&longs;elf in no danger of changing his opinion,
and he was willing to &longs;ave us from any unea&longs;ine&longs;s.
The mere mention of &longs;uch a &longs;cheme, and the possibility
of his embracing it, he knew, would considerably
impair our tranquillity.
One day, about three weeks &longs;ub&longs;equent to the
my&longs;terious call, it was agreed that the family &longs;hould
be my gue&longs;ts. Seldom had a day been pa&longs;&longs;ed by
us, of more &longs;erene enjoyment. Pleyel had promised
us his company, but we did not &longs;ee him till the
&longs;un had nearly declined. He brought with him a
countenance that betokened di&longs;appointment and
vexation. He did not wait for our inquiries, but
immediately explained the cau&longs;e. Two days before
a packet had arrived from Hamburgh, by which
he had &longs;lattered him&longs;elf with the expectation of
receiving letters, but no letters had arrived. I never
&longs;aw him &longs;o much &longs;ubdued by an untoward event.
His thoughts were employed in accounting for the
&longs;ilence of his friends. He was &longs;eized with the torments
of jealou&longs;y, and &longs;u&longs;pected nothing le&longs;s than
the infidelity of her to whom he had devoted his




heart. The &longs;ilence mu&longs;t have been concerted.
Her &longs;ickne&longs;s, or ab&longs;ence, or death, would have increased
the certainty of &longs;ome one's having written.
No &longs;uppo&longs;ition could be formed but that his mistress
had grown indifferent, or that &longs;he had transferred
her affections to another. The mi&longs;carriage
of a letter was hardly within the reach of po&longs;&longs;ibility.
From Leip&longs;ig to Hamburgh, and from Hamburgh
hither, the conveyance was expo&longs;ed to no hazard.
He had been &longs;o long detained in America chiefly
in con&longs;equence of Wieland's aver&longs;ion to the &longs;cheme
which he propo&longs;ed. He now became more impatient
than ever to return to Europe. When he
reflected that, by his delays, he had probably forfeited
the affections of his mi&longs;tre&longs;s, his &longs;en&longs;ations
amounted to agony. It only remained, by his
&longs;peedy departure, to repair, if po&longs;&longs;ible, or prevent
&longs;o intolerable an evil. Already he had half re&longs;olved
to embark in this very &longs;hip which, he was informed,
would &longs;et out in a few weeks on her return.
Meanwhile he determined to make a new attempt
to &longs;hake the re&longs;olution of Wieland. The
evening was &longs;omewhat advanced when he invited
the latter to walk abroad with him. The invitation
was accepted, and they left Catharine, Loui&longs;a and
me, to amu&longs;e our&longs;elves by the be&longs;t means in our
power. During this walk, Pleyel renewed the
&longs;ubject that was neare&longs;t his heart. He re-urged all
his former arguments, and placed them in more
forcible lights.
They promi&longs;ed to return &longs;hortly; but hour after
hour pa&longs;&longs;ed, and they made not their appearance.
Engaged in &longs;prightly conver&longs;ation, it was not till
the clock &longs;truck twelve that we were reminded of
the lap&longs;e of time. The ab&longs;ence of our friends excited
&longs;ome unea&longs;y apprehen&longs;ions. We were




expressing our fears, and comparing our conjectures
as to what might be the cau&longs;e, when they entered
together. There were indications in their countenances
that &longs;truck me mute. The&longs;e were unnoticed
by Catharine, who was eager to expre&longs;s her
&longs;urprize and curio&longs;ity at the length of their
walk. As they li&longs;tened to her, I remarked that
their &longs;urprize was not le&longs;s than ours. They
gazed in &longs;ilence on each other, and on her. I
watched their looks, but could not under&longs;tand the
emotions that were written in them.
The&longs;e appearances diverted Catharine's inquiries
into a new channel. What did they mean, &longs;he
a&longs;ked, by their &longs;ilence, and by their thus gazing
wildly at each other, and at her? Pleyel profited by
this hint, and a&longs;&longs;uming an air of indifference, framed
&longs;ome trifling excu&longs;e, at the &longs;ame time darting significant
glances at Wieland, as if to caution him
again&longs;t di&longs;clo&longs;ing the truth. My brother &longs;aid nothing,
but delivered him&longs;elf up to meditation. I
likewi&longs;e was &longs;ilent, but burned with impatience to
fathom this my&longs;tery. Pre&longs;ently my brother and
his wife, and Loui&longs;a, returned home. Pleyel proposed,
of his own accord, to be my gue&longs;t for the
night. This circum&longs;tance, in addition to tho&longs;e
which preceded, gave new edge to my wonder.
As &longs;oon as we were left alone, Pleyel's countenance
a&longs;&longs;umed an air of &longs;eriou&longs;ne&longs;s, and even consternation,
which I had never before beheld in him.
The &longs;teps with which he mea&longs;ured the floor betokened
the trouble of his thoughts. My inquiries were
&longs;u&longs;pended by the hope that he would give me the
information that I wanted without the importunity
of que&longs;tions. I waited &longs;ome time, but the confusion
of his thoughts appeared in no degree to abate.
At length I mentioned the apprehen&longs;ions which




their unu&longs;ual ab&longs;ence had occa&longs;ioned, and which
were increa&longs;ed by their behaviour &longs;ince their return,
and &longs;olicited an explanation. He &longs;topped when I
began to &longs;peak, and looked &longs;tedfa&longs;tly at me. When
I had done, he &longs;aid, to me, in a tone which faultered
through the vehemence of his emotions, “How
were you employed during our ab&longs;ence?” “In
curning over the Della Cru&longs;ca dictionary, and talking
on different &longs;ubjects; but ju&longs;t before your entrance,
we were tormenting our&longs;elves with omens
and progno&longs;ticks relative to your ab&longs;ence.” “Catharine
was with you the whole time?” “Yes,”
“But are you &longs;ure?” “Mo&longs;t &longs;ure. She was not
ab&longs;ent a moment.” He &longs;tood, for a time, as if to
a&longs;&longs;ure him&longs;elf of my &longs;incerity. Then, clenching
his hands, and wildly lifting them above his head,
“Lo,” cried he, “I have news to tell you. The
Barone&longs;s de Stolberg is dead?”
This was her whom he loved. I was not surprised
at the agitations which he betrayed. “But
how was the information procured? How was
the truth of this news connected with the circumstance
of Catharine's remaining in our company?”
He was for &longs;ome time inattentive to my que&longs;tions.
When he &longs;poke, it &longs;eemed merely a continuation of
the reverie into which he had been plunged.
“And yet it might be a mere deception. But
could both of us in that ca&longs;e have been deceived?
A rare and prodigious coincidence! Barely not
impo&longs;&longs;ible. And yet, if the accent be oracular—
There&longs;a is dead. No, no,” continued he, covering
his face with his hands, and in a tone half
broken into &longs;obs, “I cannot believe it. She has
not written, but if &longs;he were dead, the faithful Bertrand
would have given me the earlie&longs;t information.
And yet if he knew his ma&longs;ter, he mu&longs;t have ea&longs;ily





gue&longs;&longs;ed at the effect of &longs;uch tidings. In pity to me
he was &longs;ilent.”
“Clara, forgive me; to you, this behaviour is
my&longs;terious. I will explain as well as I am able.
But &longs;ay not a word to Catharine. Her &longs;trength of
mind is inferior to your's. She will, be&longs;ides, have
more rea&longs;on to be &longs;tartled. She is Wieland's angel.”

Pleyel proceeded to inform me, for the fir&longs;t time,
of the &longs;cheme which he had pre&longs;&longs;ed, with &longs;o much
earne&longs;tne&longs;s, on my brother. He enumerated the
objections which had been made, and the indu&longs;try
with which he had endeavoured to confuse them.
He mentioned the effect upon his re&longs;olutions produced
by the failure of a letter. “During our late
walk,” continued he, “I introduced the &longs;ubject
that was neare&longs;t my heart. I re-urged all my former
arguments, and placed them in more forcible lights.
Wieland was &longs;till refractory. He expatiated on
the perils of wealth and power, on the &longs;acredne&longs;s
of conjugal and parental duties, and the happine&longs;s
of mediocrity.
“No wonder that the time pa&longs;&longs;ed, unperceived,
away. Our whole &longs;ouls were engaged in this
cau&longs;e. Several times we came to the foot of the
rock; as &longs;oon as we perceived it, we changed
our cour&longs;e, but never failed to terminate our
circuitous and devious ramble at this &longs;pot. At
length your brother ob&longs;erved, “We &longs;eem to be
led hither by a kind of fatality. Since we are &longs;o
near, let us a&longs;cend and re&longs;t our&longs;elves a while. If
you are not weary of this argument we will re&longs;ume
it there.”
“I tacitly con&longs;ented. We mounted the &longs;tairs,
and drawing the &longs;ofa in front of the river, we
&longs;eated our&longs;elves upon it. I took up the thread of




our di&longs;cour&longs;e where we had dropped it. I ridiculed
his dread of the &longs;ea, and his attachment to home.
I kept on in this &longs;train, &longs;o congenial with my disposition,
for &longs;ome time, uninterrupted by him. At
length, he &longs;aid to me, “Suppo&longs;e now that I, whom
argument has not convinced, &longs;hould yield to ridicule,
and &longs;hould agree that your &longs;cheme is eligible;
what will you have gained? Nothing. You
have other enemies be&longs;ide my&longs;elf to encounter.
When you have vanqui&longs;hed me, your toil has
&longs;carcely begun. There are my &longs;i&longs;ter and wife,
with whom it will remain for you to maintain the
conte&longs;t. And tru&longs;t me, they are adver&longs;aries whom
all your force and &longs;tratagem will never &longs;ubdue.”
I in&longs;inuated that they would model them&longs;elves by
his will: that Catharine would think obedience
her duty. He an&longs;wered, with &longs;ome quickne&longs;s,
“You mi&longs;take. Their concurrence is indispensable.
It is not my cu&longs;tom to exact &longs;acrifices of
this kind. I live to be their protector and friend,
and not their tyrant and foe. If my wife &longs;hall
deem her happine&longs;s, and that of her children, mo&longs;t
con&longs;ulted by remaining where &longs;he is, here &longs;he &longs;hall
remain.” “But,” &longs;aid I, “when &longs;he knows your
plea&longs;ure, will &longs;he not conform to it?” Before
my friend had time to an&longs;wer this que&longs;tion, a negative
was clearly and di&longs;tinctly uttered from another
quarter. It did not come from one &longs;ide or the
other, from before us or behind. Whence then
did it come? By who&longs;e organs was it fa&longs;hioned?
“If any uncertainty had exi&longs;ted with regard to
the&longs;e particulars, it would have been removed by a
deliberate and equally di&longs;tinct repetition of the &longs;ame
mono&longs;yllable, “No.” The voice was my &longs;i&longs;ter's.
It appeared to come from the roof. I &longs;tarted from
my &longs;eat. Catharine, exclaimed I, where are you?




No an&longs;wer was returned. I &longs;earched the room,
and the area before it, but in vain. Your brother
was motionle&longs;s in his &longs;eat. I returned to him,
and placed my&longs;elf again by his &longs;ide. My astonishment
was not le&longs;s than his.”
“Well,” &longs;aid he, at length, “What think you
of this? This is the &longs;elf-&longs;ame voice which I formerly
heard; you are now convinced that my ears
were well informed.”
“Yes,” &longs;aid I, “this, it is plain, is no fiction
of the fancy.” We again &longs;unk into mutual and
thoughtful &longs;ilence. A recollection of the hour,
and of the length of our ab&longs;ence, made me at la&longs;t
propo&longs;e to return. We ro&longs;e up for this purpo&longs;e.
In doing this, my mind reverted to the contemplation
of my own condition. “Yes,” &longs;aid I aloud,
but without particularly addre&longs;&longs;ing my&longs;elf to Wieland,
“my re&longs;olution is taken. I cannot hope to
prevail with my friends to accompany me. They
may doze away their days on the banks of Schuylkill,
but as to me, I go in the next ve&longs;&longs;el; I will
fly to her pre&longs;ence, and demand the rea&longs;on of this
extraordinary &longs;ilence.”
“I had &longs;carcely fini&longs;hed the &longs;entence, when the
&longs;ame my&longs;terious voice exclaimed, “You &longs;hall not
go. The &longs;eal of death is on her lips. Her &longs;ilence
is the &longs;ilence of the tomb.” Think of the effects
which accents like the&longs;e mu&longs;t have had upon me.
I &longs;huddered as I
li&longs;tened. As &longs;oon as I recovered
from my fir&longs;t amazement, “Who is it that &longs;peaks?”
&longs;aid I, “whence did you procure the&longs;e di&longs;mal tidings?”
I did not wait long for an an&longs;wer. “From
a &longs;ource that cannot fail. Be &longs;atisfied. She is dead.”
You may ju&longs;tly be &longs;urpri&longs;ed, that, in the circumstances
in which I heard the tidings, and notwithstanding
the my&longs;tery which environed him by




whom they were imparted, I could give an undivided
attention to the facts, which were the &longs;ubject
of our dialogue. I eagerly inquired, when and
where did &longs;he die? What was the cau&longs;e of her
death? Was her death ab&longs;olutely certain? An
an&longs;wer was returned only to the la&longs;t of the&longs;e questions.
“Yes,” was pronounced by the &longs;ame voice;
but it now &longs;ounded from a greater di&longs;tance, and
the deepe&longs;t &longs;ilence was all the return made to my
&longs;ub&longs;equent interrogatories.
“It was my &longs;i&longs;ter's voice; but it could not be
uttered by her; and yet, if not by her, by whom
was it uttered? When we returned hither, and
di&longs;covered you together, the doubt that had previously
exi&longs;ted was removed. It was manife&longs;t that
the intimation came not from her. Yet if not
from her, from whom could it come? Are the
circum&longs;tances attending the imparting of this news
proof that the tidings are true? God forbid that
they &longs;hould be true.”
Here Pleyel &longs;unk into anxious &longs;ilence, and gave
me lei&longs;ure to ruminate on this inexplicable event.
I am at a lo&longs;s to de&longs;cribe the &longs;en&longs;ations that affected
me. I am not fearful of &longs;hadows. The tales of
apparitions and enchantments did not po&longs;&longs;e&longs;s that
power over my belief which could even render
them intere&longs;ting. I &longs;aw nothing in them but ignorance
and folly, and was a &longs;tranger even to that
terror which is plea&longs;ing. But this incident was
different from any that I had ever before known.
Here were proofs of a &longs;en&longs;ible and intelligent
exi&longs;tence, which could not be denied. Here was
information obtained and imparted by means unquestionably
&longs;uper-human.
That there are con&longs;cious beings, be&longs;ide our&longs;elves,
in exi&longs;tence, who&longs;e modes of activity and





information &longs;urpa&longs;s our own, can &longs;carcely be denied.
Is there a glimp&longs;e afforded us into a world of the&longs;e
&longs;uperior beings? My heart was &longs;carcely large
enough to give admittance to &longs;o &longs;welling a thought.
An awe, the &longs;weete&longs;t and mo&longs;t &longs;olemn that imagination
can conceive, pervaded my whole frame.
It for&longs;ook me not when I parted from Pleyel and
retired to my chamber. An impul&longs;e was given to
my &longs;pirits utterly incompatible with &longs;leep. I pa&longs;&longs;ed
the night wakeful and full of meditation. I was
impre&longs;&longs;ed with the belief of my&longs;terious, but not of
malignant agency. Hitherto nothing had occurred
to per&longs;uade me that this airy mini&longs;ter was bu&longs;y to
evil rather than to good purpo&longs;es. On the contrary,
the idea of &longs;uperior virtue had always been
a&longs;&longs;ociated in my mind with that of &longs;uperior power.
The warnings that had thus been heard appeared
to have been prompted by beneficent intentions.
My brother had been hindered by this voice from
a&longs;cending the hill. He was told that danger lurked
in his path, and his obedience to the intimation had
perhaps &longs;aved him from a de&longs;tiny &longs;imilar to that
of my father.
Pleyel had been re&longs;cued from tormenting uncertainty,
and from the hazards and fatigues of a
fruitle&longs;s voyage, by the &longs;ame interpo&longs;ition. It had
a&longs;&longs;ured him of the death of his There&longs;a.
This woman was then dead. A confirmation
of the tidings, if true, would &longs;peedily arrive. Was
this confirmation to be deprecated or de&longs;ired? By
her death, the tie that attached him to Europe, was
taken away. Henceforward every motive would
combine to retain him in his native country, and
we were re&longs;cued from the deep regrets that would
accompany his hopele&longs;s ab&longs;ence from us, Propitious
was the &longs;pirit that imparted the&longs;e tidings.




Propitious he would perhaps have been, if he had
been in&longs;trumental in producing, as well as in communicating
the ridings of her death. Propitious to
us, the friends of Pleyel, to whom has thereby been
&longs;ecured the enjoyment of his &longs;ociety; and not unpropitious
to him&longs;elf; for though this object of his love
be &longs;natched away, is there not another who is able
and willing to con&longs;ole him for her lo&longs;s?
Twenty days after this, another ve&longs;&longs;el arrived
from the &longs;ame port. In this interval, Pleyel, for
the mo&longs;t part, e&longs;tranged him&longs;elf from his old companions.
He was become the prey of a gloomy
and un&longs;ociable grief. His walks were limited to
the bank of the Delaware. This bank is an
artificial one. Reeds and the river are on one &longs;ide,
and a watery mar&longs;h on the other, in that part
which bounded his lands, and which extended from
the mouth of Hollander's creek to that of Schuylkill.
No &longs;cene can be imagined le&longs;s enticing to a
lover of the picture&longs;que than this. The &longs;hore is
deformed with mud, and incumbered with a fore&longs;t
of reeds. The fields, in mo&longs;t &longs;ea&longs;ons, are mire;
but when they afford a firm footing, the ditches
by which they are bounded and inter&longs;ected, are
mantled with &longs;tagnating green, and emit the mo&longs;t
noxious exhalations. Health is no le&longs;s a &longs;tranger
to tho&longs;e &longs;eats than plea&longs;ure. Spring and autumn
are &longs;ure to be accompanied with agues and bilious
remittents.
The &longs;cenes which environed our dwellings at
Mettingen con&longs;tituted the rever&longs;e of this. Schuylkill
was here a pure and tran&longs;lucid current, broken
into wild and cea&longs;ele&longs;s mu&longs;ic by rocky points, murmuring
on a &longs;andy margin, and reflecting on its
&longs;urface, banks of all varieties of height and degrees
of declivity. The&longs;e banks were chequered by




patches of dark verdure and &longs;hapele&longs;s ma&longs;&longs;es of
white marble, and crowned by cop&longs;es of cedar,
or by the regular magnificence of orchards, which,
at this &longs;ea&longs;on, were in blo&longs;&longs;om, and were prodigal
of odours. The ground which receded from the
river was &longs;cooped into valleys and dales. Its beauties
were enhanced by the horticultural &longs;kill of my
brother, who bedecked this exqui&longs;ite a&longs;&longs;emblage of
&longs;lopes and ri&longs;ings with every &longs;pecies of vegetable
ornament, from the giant arms of the oak to the
clu&longs;tering tendrils of the honey-&longs;uckle.
To &longs;creen him from the unwhole&longs;ome airs of
his own re&longs;idence, it had been propo&longs;ed to Pleyel
to &longs;pend the months of &longs;pring with us. He had
apparently acquie&longs;ced in this propo&longs;al; but the late
event induced him to change his purpo&longs;e. He was
only to be &longs;een by vi&longs;iting him in his retirements.
His gaiety had flown, and every pa&longs;&longs;ion was absorbed
in eagerne&longs;s to procure tidings from Saxony. I
have mentioned the arrival of another ve&longs;&longs;el from
the Elbe. He de&longs;cried her early one morning as
he was pa&longs;&longs;ing along the &longs;kirt of the river. She
was ea&longs;ily recognized, being the &longs;hip in which he
had performed his fir&longs;t voyage to Germany. He
immediately went on board, but found no letters
directed to him. This omi&longs;&longs;ion was, in &longs;ome degree,
compen&longs;ated by meeting with an old acquaintance
among the pa&longs;&longs;engers, who had till lately been
a re&longs;ident in Leip&longs;ig. This per&longs;on put an end to
all &longs;u&longs;pen&longs;e re&longs;pecting the fate of There&longs;a, by relating
the particulars of her death and funeral.
Thus was the truth of the former intimation
atte&longs;ted. No longer devoured by &longs;u&longs;pen&longs;e, the
grief of Pleyel was not long in yielding to the influence
of &longs;ociety. He gave him&longs;elf up once more
to our company. His vivacity had indeed been




damped; but even in this re&longs;pect he was a more
acceptable companion than formerly, &longs;ince his seriousness
was neither incommunicative nor &longs;ullen.
The&longs;e incidents, for a time, occupied all our
thoughts. In me they produced a &longs;entiment not
unallied to plea&longs;ure, and more &longs;peedily than in the
ca&longs;e of my friends were intermixed with other topics.
My brother was particularly affected by them.
It was ea&longs;y to perceive that mo&longs;t of his meditations
were tinctured from this &longs;ource. To this was to
be a&longs;cribed a de&longs;ign in which his pen was, at this
period, engaged, of collecting and inve&longs;tigating the
facts which relate to that my&longs;terious per&longs;onage,
the Dæmon of Socrates.
My brother's &longs;kill in Greek and Roman learning
was exceeded by that of few, and no doubt the
world would have accepted a treati&longs;e upon this
&longs;ubject from his hand with avidity; but alas! this
and every other &longs;cheme of &longs;elicity and honor,
were doomed to &longs;udden bla&longs;t and hopele&longs;s extermination.
