I purchase new cloaths—reprimand Strutwell
and Straddle—Banter proposes another
matrimonial scheme—I accept of his
terms—set out for Bath in a stage-coach,
with the young lady and her mother
—the behaviour of an officer and
lawyer, our fellow-travellers, described— 
a smart dialogue between my mistress and
the captain. 
Having finished this affair to my satisfaction,
I found myself perfectly at ease, and
looking upon the gaming-table as a certain resource
for a gentleman in want, became more gay than
ever. —Although my cloaths were almost as
good as new, I grew ashamed of wearing them,
because I thought every body, by this time, had 

got an inventory of my wardrobe. —For which
reason, I disposed of a good part of my apparel to
a salesman in Monmouth-street, for half the
value, and bought two new suits with the money. 
I likewise purchased a plain gold watch, despairing
of recovering that which I had so foolishly
given to Strutwell, whom, notwithstanding, I
still continued to visit at his levée, until the embassador
he had mentioned, set out with a secretary
of his own chusing. —I thought myself then
at liberty to expostulate with his lordship, whom
I treated with great freedom in a letter, for
amusing me with vain hopes, when he neither
had the power nor inclination to provide for me. 
—Nor was I less reserved with Straddle, whom
I in person reproached for misrepresenting to
me the character of Strutwell, which I did not
scruple to aver was infamous in every respect. — 
He seemed very much enraged at my freedom,
talked a great deal about his quality and honour,
and began to make some comparisons which I
thought so injurious to mine, that I demanded an
explanation with great warmth; and he was mean
enough to equivocate, and condescend in such a
manner, that I left him with a hearty contempt
of his behaviour. 
About this time, Banter, who had observed a
surprizing and sudden alteration in my appearance
and disposition, began to enquire very minutely
into the cause; and as I did not think fit to let
him know the true state of the affair, lest he
might make free with my purse, on the strength
of having proposed the scheme that filled it, I
told him that I had received a small supply from a
relation in the country, who at the same time had
promised to use all his interest (which was not 

small) in solliciting some post for me that would
make me easy for life. —“If that be the case
(said Banter) perhaps you won't care to mortify
yourself a little, in making your fortune
another way. —I have a relation who is to set
out for Bath next week, with an only daughter,
who being sickly and decrepid, intends to
drink the waters for the recovery of her health. 
—Her father, who was a rich Turkey merchant,
died about a year ago, and left her
with a fortune of twenty thousand pounds,
under the sole management of her mother,
who is my kinswoman. —I would have put in
for the plate myself, but there is a breach at
present between the old woman and me. — 
You must know, that some time ago I borrowed
a small sum of her, and promised, it
seems, to pay it before a certain time; but being
disappointed in my expectation of money
from the country, the day elapsed, without
my being able to take up my note; upon
which she wrote a peremptory letter, threatning
to arrest me, if I did not pay the debt
immediately: Nettled at this precise behaviour,
I sent a damned severe answer, which enraged
her so much, that she actually took out a
writ against me. —Whereupon, finding the
thing grow serious, I got a friend to advance
the money for me, discharged the debt, went
to her house, and abused her for unfriendly dealing. 
—She was provoked by my reproaches, and
scolded in her turn. The little deformed urchin
joined her mother with such virulence and volubility
of tongue, that I was fain to make my
retreat, after having been honoured with a
great many scandalous epithets, which gave 

me plainly to understand that I had nothing to
hope from the esteem of the one, or the affection
of the other. —As they are both utter
strangers to life, it is a thousand to one that
the girl shall be picked up by some scoundrel
or other at Bath, if I don't provide for her
otherwise. —You are a well-looking fellow,
Random, and can behave as demurely as a
quaker. —Now if you will give me an obligation
for five hundred pounds, to be paid six
months after your marriage, I will put you
in a method of carrying her in spite of all opposition.” 
This proposal was too advantageous for me,
to be refused: The writing was immediately
drawn and executed; and Banter giving me notice
of the time when, and the stage-coach in
which they were to set out, I bespoke a place in
the same convenience; and having hired a horse
for Strap, who was charmed with the project,
set out accordingly. 
As we embarked before day, I had not the
pleasure for some time of seeing Miss Snapper
(that was the name of my mistress) nor even of
perceiving the number and sex of my fellow-travellers,
although I guessed that the coach was
full, by the difficulty I found in seating myself. 
—The first five minutes passed in a general silence,
when all of a sudden, the coach heeling to one
side, a boisterous voice pronounced, “To the
right and left, cover your flanks, damme!” 
I easily discovered by the tone and matter of this
exclamation, that it was uttered by a son of Mars; 
neither was it hard to conceive the profession of
another person, who sat opposite to me, and observed,
that we ought to have been well satisfied of 

the security, before we entered upon the premises. 
—These two sallies had not the desired effect: 
We continued a good while as mute as before,
till at length, the gentleman of the sword,
impatient of longer silence, made a second effort,
by swearing, he had got into a meeting of quakers. 
—“I believe so too, (said a shrill female
voice, at my left hand) for the spirit of folly
begins to move.” —“Out with it then, madam,” 
(replied the soldier.) —“You seem
to have no occasion for a midwife,” (cried
the lady.) —“D&wblank;n my blood! (exclaimed the
other) a man can't talk to a woman, but
she immediately thinks of a midwife.” — 
“True, Sir, (said she) I long to be delivered.” 
“What! of a mouse, madam?” (said he.) 
“—No, Sir, (said she) of a fool.” —“Are
you far gone with fool?” (said he.) —“Little
more than two miles,” (said she.) —“By
Gad, you're a wit, madam!” (cried the officer)
—“I wish I could with any justice return
the compliment,” (said the lady.) —“Zounds!
I have done,” (said he.) —“Your bolt is soon
shot, according to the proverb,” (said she.) 
—The warrior's powder was quite spent; the
lawyer advised him to drop the prosecution, and
a grave matron, who sat on the left hand of
the victorious wit, told her, she must not let her
tongue run so fast among strangers. —This reprimand
softened with the appellation of child,
convinced me that the satyrical lady was no other
than Miss Snapper, and resolved to regulate my
conduct accordingly. The champion finding
himself so smartly handled, changed his battery,
and began to expatiate on his own exploits. — 
“You talk of shot, madam, (said he) damme! 

I have both given and received some shot
in my time—I was wounded in the
shoulder by a pistol ball at Dettingen,
where—I say nothing—but by G&wblank;d! if
it had not been for me—all's one for that— 
I despise boasting, G&sblank;d d&wblank;me!” —So saying,
he whistled one part and hummed another of
Black Joke; then addressing himself to the lawyer,
went on thus, “Wouldn't you think it damn'd
hard, after having, at the risk of your life, recovered
the standard of a regiment, that had
been lost, to receive no preferment for your
pains! I don't chuse to name no names, sink
me! but howsomever, this I will refer, by
G&sblank;d, and that is this, a musqueteer of the
French guards, having taken a standard from
a certain cornet of a certain regiment, damme!
was retreating with his prize as fast as his
horse's heels could carry him, damme! Upon
which, I snatched up a firelock that belonged
to a dead man, damme! and shot his horse
under him, d&wblank;n my blood! The fellow got
upon his feet and began to repose me, upon
which I charged my bayonet breast high, and
run him through the body, by G&sblank;d! —One
of his comrades coming to his assistance, shot
me in the shoulder, as I told you before; and
another gave me a confusion on the head with
the butt end of his carbine; but damme, that
did not signify—I killed one, put the other to
flight, and taking up the standard carried it
off very deliberately—But the best joke of
all was, the son of a b&wblank;ch of a cornet who
had surrendered it in a cowardly manner, seeing
it in my possession, demanded it from me,
in the front of the line.” —“D&wblank;n my blood 

(says he) where did you find my standard?” 
(says he.) —“D&wblank;n my blood (said I) where
(said I) did you lose it?” (said I.) —“That's
nothing to you (says he) 'tis my standard (says
he) and by G&sblank;d I'll have it.” (says he.) — 
“D&wblank;n&wblank;ti&wblank;n seize me (says I) if you shall
(says I) till I have first delivered it to the General
(says I;) and accordingly I went to the head
quarters, after the battle, and delivered it to
my Lord Stair, who promised to do for me,
but I am no more than a poor lieutenant still,
d&wblank;n my blood.” 
Having vented this repetition of expletives, the
lawyer owned he had not been requited according
to his deserts; observed, that the labourer is
always worthy of his hire, and asked if the promise
was made before witnesses, because in that
case the law would compel the General to perform
it;—but understanding that the promise was performed
during a tête a tête, over a bottle, without
being restricted to time or terms, he pronounced
it not valid in law, proceeded to enquire
into the particulars of the battle, and affirmed,
that although the English had drawn
themselves into a premunire at first, the French
managed their cause so lamely in the course of
the dispute, that they would have been utterly
nonsuited, had they not obtained a noli-prosequi. 
—In spite of these enlivening touches, the
conversation was like to suffer another long interruption; 
when the lieutenant, unwilling to
conceal any of his accomplishments that could
be displayed in his present situation, offered to regale
the company with a song; and interpreting
our silence into a desire of hearing, began to 

warble a fashionable air, the first stanza of which
be pronounced thus: 
“Would task the moon-ty'd hair,
To yon flagrant beau repair;
Where waving with the poppling vow
The bantling fine will shelter you, &c.”
The sense of the rest he perverted as he went
on, with such surprizing facility, that I could
not help thinking he had been at some pains to
burlesque the performance. —Miss Snapper ascribed
it to the true cause, namely ignorance; 
and when he asked her how she relished his musick,
answered, that in her opinion, the musick
and the words were much of a piece. —“O!
d&wblank;n my blood! (said he) I take that as a
high compliment; for every body allows the
words are damnable fine.” —“They may
be so, (replied the lady) for ought I know,
but they are above my comprehension.” —“I
an't obliged to find you comprehension, madam,
curse me!” (cried he.) —“No,
nor to speak sense neither,” (said she.) — 
“D&wblank;n my heart (said he) I'll speak what I
please.” —Here the lawyer interposed, by
telling him there were some things he must not
speak. —And upon being defyed to give an instance,
mentioned Treason and Defamation. — 
“As for the king, (cried the soldier) God bless
him—I eat his bread, and have lost blood in
his cause, therefore I have nothing to say to
him—but by G&wblank;d, I dare say any thing to
any other man.” —“No, (said the lawyer)
you dare not call me rogue.” —“Damme, for 

what?” said the other. —“Because (replied the
counsellor) I should have a good action against
you, and recover.” —“Well, well, (cried
the officer) if I dare not call you rogue, I
dare think you one, damme! —This stroke of
wit he accompanied with a loud laugh of self-approbation,
which unluckily did not affect the
audience, but effectually silenced his antagonist,
who did not open his mouth for the space of an
hour thereafter, except to clear his pipes with
three bemms, which, however, produced nothing.
