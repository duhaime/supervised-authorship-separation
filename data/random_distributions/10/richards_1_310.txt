Miss Clarissa Harlowe, To Hannah Burton. 

Thursday, June 29. 
My good Hannah,
Strange things have happened to me, since
you were dismissed my service (so sorely against
my will) and your pert fellow-servant set over me. 
But that must be all forgotten nowâ€” 
How do you, my Hannah? Are you recovered of
you illness? If you are, Do you chuse to come and
be with me? Or can you conveniently? 
I am a very unhappy creature, and, being among
all strangers, should be glad to have you with me, of
whose Fidelity and Love I have had so many acceptable
instances. 
Living or dying, I will endeavour to make it worth
your while, my Hannah. 
If you are recovered, as I hope, and if you have a
good place, it may be they would bear with your absence,
and suffer somebody in your room for a month 

or so: And, by that time, I hope to be provided for,
and you may then return to your place. 
Don't let any of my friends know of this my desire; 
whether you can come or not. 
I am at Mr. Smith's, a Hosier's and Glove-shop,
in King-street, Covent-garden. 
You must direct to me by the name of Rachel
Clark. 
Do, my good Hannah, come if you can, to your
poor young mistress, who always valued you, and
always will whether you come or not. 
I send this to your Mother at St. Alban's, not
knowing where to direct to you. Return me a line,
that I may know what to depend upon: And I shall
see you have not forgotten the pretty hand you were
taught, in happy days, by 
Your true Friend,
Clarissa Harlowe.
