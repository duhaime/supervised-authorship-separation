Renaldo abridges the proceedings at law, and approves
himself the son of his father. 
The major finding him determined, insisted
upon attending him in his expedition, and
they set out together for Presburg, where they
privately arrived in the dark, resolving to keep
themselves concealed at the house of a friend,
until they should have formed some plan for
their future operations. Here they were informed
that count Trebasi's castle was altogether
inaccessible; that all the servants who were
supposed to have the least veneration or compassion
for the countess, were dismissed; and
that since Renaldo was known to be in Germany,
the vigilance and caution of that cruel husband
were redoubled to such a degree, that no
body knew whether his unfortunate lady was
actually alive or dead. 
Farrel perceiving Melvile exceedingly affected
with this intimation, and hearing him declare
that he would never quit Presburg, until he
should have entered the house, and removed
his doubts on that interesting subject; not only
argued with great vehemence against such an
attempt, as equally dangerous and indiscreet,
but solemnly swore he would prevent his purpose,
by discovering his design to the family,
unless he would promise to listen to a more
moderate and feasible expedient. He then proposed that he himself should appear in the equipage
of one of those travelling Savoyards who
stroll about Europe, amusing ignorant people
with the effects of a magic lanthorn, and in that 

disguise endeavour to obtain admittance from
the servants of Trebasi, among whom he might
make such inquiries, as would deliver Melvile
from his present uneasy suspense. 
This proposal was embraced, tho' reluctantly,
by Renaldo, who was unwilling to expose his
friend to the least danger or disgrace; and the
major being next day provided with the habit
and implements of his new profession, together
with a ragged attendant who preceded him,
extorting music from a paltry viole, approached
the castle-gate, and proclaimed his show so naturally
in a yell partaking of the scream of Savoy
and the howl of Ireland, that one would
have imagined he had been conductor to madam
Catherina from his cradle. So far his
stratagem succeeded: he had not long stood in
waiting, before he was invited into the courtyard,
where the servants formed a ring, and
danced to the efforts of his companion's skill; 
then he was conducted into the buttery, where
he exhibited his figures on the wall and his princess
on the floor; and while they regaled him
in this manner with scraps and sour wine, he
took occasion to inquire about the old lady and
her daughter, before whom he said he had performed
in his last peregrination. Tho' this
question was asked with all that air of simplicity
which is peculiar to these people, one of the
domestics took the alarm, being infected with
the suspicions of his master, and plainly taxed
the major with being a spy, threatening at the
same time that he should be stripped and searched. 
This would have been a very dangerous experiment
for the Hibernian, who had actually
in his pocket a letter to the countess from her 

son, which he hoped fortune might have furnished
him with an opportunity to deliver. 
When he therefore found himself in this dilemma,
he was not at all easy in his own mind:
however, instead of protesting his innocence in
an humble and beseeching strain, in order to
acquit himself of the charge,he resolved to elude
the suspicion, by provoking the wrath of his
accuser, and putting on the air of vulgar integrity
affronted, began to reproach the servant
in very insolent terms for his unfair supposition,
and undressing himself in a moment to the skin,
threw his tattered garments in the face of his
adversary, telling him he would find nothing
there which he would not be very glad to part
with; at the same time raising his voice, he, in
the gibberish of the clan he represented, scolded
and cursed with great fluency: so that the
whole house resounded with the noise. The
valet's jealousy, like a smaller fire, was in a trice
swallowed up in the greater flame of his rage
enkindled by this abrupt address: in consequence
of which, Farrel was kicked out at the
gate, naked as he was to the waist, after his lanthorn
had been broke to pieces on his head; 
and there he was joined by his domestic, who
had not been able to recover his apparel and
effect a retreat, without incurring marks of the
same sort of distinction. 
The major, considering the risk he must have
run in being detected, thought himself cheaply
quit for this moderate discipline, though he was
really concerned for his friend Renaldo, who
understanding the particulars of the adventure,
determined, as the last effort, to ride round the
castle in the open day, on pretence of taking
the air, when, peradventure, the countess would 

see him from the place of her confinement, and
favour him with some mark or token of her
being alive. 
Though his companion did not much relish
this plan, which he foresaw would expose him
to the insults of Trebasi; yet, as he could not
contrive a better, he acquiesced in Renaldo's invention,
with the proviso, that he would defer
the execution of it until his father in-law should
be absent in the chace, which was a diversion
he every day enjoyed. 
Accordingly they set a proper watch, and
lay concealed until they were informed of Trebasi's
having gone forth; when they mounted
their horses, and rode unto the neighbourhood
of the castle. Having made a small excursion
in the adjoining fields, they drew near the walls
and at an easy pace had twice circled them,
when Farrel descried at the top of a tower, a
white handkerchief waved by a woman's hand
thro' the iron bars that secured the window. 
This signal being pointed to Renaldo, his heart
began to throb with great violence; he made
a respectful obeissance towards the part in
which it appeared, and perceiving the hand
beckoning him to approach, advanced to the
very buttress of the turret; upon which, seeing
something drop, he alighted with great expedition,
and took up a picture of his father in
miniature, the features of which he no sooner
distinguished, than the tears ran down his
cheeks; he pressed the little image to his lips
with the most filial fervour; then conveying
it to his bosom, looked up to the hand, which
waved in such a manner, as gave him to understand
it was high time to retire. Being by this
time highly persuaded that his kind monitor 

was no other than the countess herself, he pointed
to his heart, in token of his filial affection,
and laying his hand on his sword, to denote
his resolution of doing her justice, he took his
leave with another profound bow, and suffered
himself to be reconducted to his lodging. 
Every cicumstance of this transaction was observed
by the servants of count Trebasi, who
immediately dispatched a messenger to their
lord, with an account of what had happened. 
Alarmed at this information, from which he
immediately concluded that the stranger was
young Melvile, he forthwith quitted the chace,
and returning to the castle by a private postern,
ordered his horse to be kept ready saddled, in
hope that his son-in-law would repeat the visit
to his mother. This precaution would have
been to no purpose, had Renaldo followed the
advice of Farrel, who represented the danger
of returning to a place where the alarm was
undoubtedly given by his first appearance; and
exhorted him to return to Vienna for the prosecution
of his suit, now that he was satisfied of
his mother's being alive; in order to strengthen
this admonition, he bade him recollect the signal
for withdrawing, which was doubtless the effect
of maternal concern, inspired by the knowledge
of the count's vigilance and vindictive disposition. 
Notwithstanding these suggestions, Melvile
persisted in his resolution of appearing once
more below the tower, on the supposition
that his mother, in expectation of his return,
had prepared a billet for his acceptance, from
which he might obtain important intelligence. 
The major seeing him lend a deaf ear to his
remonstrances, was contented to attend him in 

this second expedition, which he pressed him to
undertake that same afternoon, as Trebasi had
taken care to circulate a report of his having
gone to dine at the seat of a nobleman in
the neighbourhood. Our knight-errant and his
squire, deceived by this finesse, presented themselves
again under the prison of the countess,
who no sooner beheld her son return than she
earnestly intreated him to be gone, by the same
sign which she had before used; and he taking
it for granted that she was debarred the use of
pen ink and paper, and that he had nothing more
to expect, consented to retire, and had already
moved to some distance from the house, when
in crossing a small plantation that belonged to
the castle, they were met by count Trebasi and
another person on horseback. 
At sight of this apparition, the blood mounted
into Renaldo's cheeks, and his eyes began
to lighten with eagerness and indignation; 
which was not at all diminished by the ferocious
address of the count, who, advancing to
Melvile, with a menacing air, “Before you
proceed,” said he, “I must know with what
view you have been twice to day patroling round
my inclosures, and reconnoitring the different
avenues of my house: you likewise carry on
a clandestine correspondence with some person
in the family, of which my honour obliges me
to demand an explanation.” 
“Had your actions been always regulated
by the dictates of honour, replied Renaldo, I
should never have been questioned for riding
round that castle which you know is my rightful
inheritance; or excluded from the sight of
a parent who suffers under your tyranny and
oppression. It is my part, therefore, to expostulate; 

and, since fortune hath favoured me
with an opportunity of revenging our wrongs
in person, we shall not part, until you have
learned that the family of the count de Melvile
is not to be injured with impunity. Here is no
advantage on either side, in point of arms or
number, you are better mounted than I am,
and shall have the choice of the ground on
which our difference ought to be brought to a
speedy determination.” 
Trebasi, whose courage was not of the sentimental
kind, but purely owing to his natural
insensibility of danger, instead of concerting
measures cooly for the engagement, or making
any verbal reply to this defiance, drew a pistol
without the least hesitation, and fired it at the
face of Renaldo, part of whose left eye brow
was carried off by the ball. Melvile was not
slow in returning the compliment, which, as it
was deliberate, proved the more decisive: for
the shot entering the count's right breast; made
its way to the back bone with such a shock, as
struck him to the ground; upon which the other
alighted, in order to improve the advantage
he had gained. 
During this transaction, Farrel had well
nigh lost his life by the savage behaviour of
Trebasi's attendant, who had been a hussar officer,
and who thinking it was his duty to imitate
the example of his patron on this occasion,
discharged a pistol at the major before
he had the least intimation of his design. The
Hibernian's horse being a common hireling,
and unaccustomed to stand fire, no sooner
saw the flash of Trebasi's pistol, than starting
aside, he happened to plunge into a hole, and
was overturned at the very instant when the 

hussar's piece went off, so that no damage ensued
to his rider, who pitching on his feet,
flew with great nimbleness to his adversary,
then laying hold on one leg, dismounted him
in a twinkling, and seizing his throat as he
lay, would have soon dispatched him without
the use of fire-arms, had he not been prevented
by his friend Renaldo, who desired him to
desist, observing that his vengeance was already
satisfied, as the count seemed to be in the
agonies of death. The major was loth to quit
his prey, as he thought his aggressor had acted
in a treacherous manner; but recollecting that
there was no time to lose, because, in all probality,
the firing had alarmed the castle, he
took his leave of the vanquished hussar, with
a couple of hearty kicks, and mounting his
horse, followed Melvile to the house of a gentleman
in the neighbourhood, who was kinsman
to the countess, and very well disposed
to grant him a secure retreat, until the troublesome
consequences of this rencounter should
be overblown. 
Trebasi, though to the young gentleman he
seemed speechless and insensible, had neither
lost the use of his reason, nor of his tongue,
but affected that extremity, in order to avoid
any further conversation with the victor. He
was one of those people who never think of
death until he knocks at the door, and then
earnestly intreat him to excuse them for the
present, and be so good as to call another time. 
The count had so often escaped unhurt, in the
course of his campaigns, that he looked upon
himself as invulnerable, and set all danger at
defiance. Though he had hitherto taken no
care of the concerns of his soul, he had a large 

fund of superstition at bottom; and when the
surgeon who examined his wounds, declared
it was mortal, all the terrors of futurity took
hold on his imagination, and all the misdemeanours
of his life presented themselves in aggravated
colours to his recollection. 
He implored the spiritual assistance of a
good priest in the neighbourhood, who, in
the discharge of his own conscience, gave him
to understand, that he had little mercy to expect,
unless he would, as much as lay in his
power, redress the injuries he had done to his
fellow creatures. As nothing lay heavier upon
his soul than the cruelty and fraud he had
practised upon the family of count Melvile,
he earnestly besought this charitable clergyman
to mediate his pardon with the countess,
and at the same time desired to see Renaldo
before his death, that he might put him in
possession of his paternal estate, and sollicit
his forgiveness for the offence he had given. 
His lady, far from waiting for the priest's
intercession, no sooner understood the lamentable
situation of her husband, and found herself
at liberty, than she hastened to his apartment,
expressed the utmost concern for his
misfortune, and tended him with truly conjugal
tenderness and fidelity. Her son gladly
obeyed the summons, and was received with
great civility and satisfaction by his father-in-law,
who, in presence of the judge and divers
gentlemen assembled for that purpose, renounced
all right and title to the fortune he had so
unjustly usurped; disclosed the name of the
convent to which mademoiselle de Melvile had
been conveyed, dismissed all the agents of his
iniquity, and being reconciled to his son-in-law, 

began to prepare himself in tranquillity
for his latter end. 
The countess was overwhelmed with an excess
of joy, while she embraced her long lost
son, who had proved himself so worthy of his
father. Yet this joy was imbittered, by reflecting
that she was made a widow by the hands of
that darling son: for, though she knew his
honour demanded the sacrifice, she could not
lay aside that regard and veneration which is
attached to the name of husband; and therefore
resolved to retire into a monastry, where
she could spend the remainder of her life in
devotion, without being exposed to any intercourse
which might interfere with the delicacy
of her sentiments on that subject.
