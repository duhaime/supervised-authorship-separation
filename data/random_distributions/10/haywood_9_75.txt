Contains the sequel of Sophia's story. 
“Tho' the old lady, resumed Sophia, pursuing the thread of her discourse, shew'd a most tender care in tucking the cloaths about me, and drawing close the curtains of the bed, I found it impossible, after she was gone, to compose myself to rest;—it was not the thoughts of what I was about to do, nor the step I had taken towards it, that kept me waking, for I accused myself not of the least imprudence in that affair, nor once imagined that the condition I was going to enter into would not render me perfectly happy; but it was a strange mixture of ideas, which I then thought nothing to the purpose, and could not account for, but have since ascribed, and ever must ascribe, to the goodness of my guardian angel, which prevented me from falling into a state which must have deprived me of the power of resisting the worst mischief that could have happen'd to me. 
“Finding I could not sleep, the moon shining extremely bright, I got out of bed and throwing on my wrapping gown I went to the window which looked into a pretty large garden, the air was sweet and serene, and the beams of my favourite planet glittering among the trees and plants afforded a very delightful prospect, and fill'd me with solemn contemplations on the beauties of nature, and the bounties for which we are indebted to the Great Author of our being. 
“How long I should have remained in this pleasing resvery I know not, if I had not been disturbed by fancying I heard something behind me in the chamber;—on turning my head hastily about, in order to convince myself, I saw the figure of a man in a nightgown and cap, but could not distinguish the face, he being in the dark part of the room;—I shriek'd out,’ ‘Hush,—hush,’ said he advancing;—I then found it was Willmore; and tho’ less frighted than before, was equally astonished,”—‘Willmore, cried I, what brings you here?’ 
‘I should rather ask, said he, what brings you out of bed at this unseasonable hour? —Come,—come, my dear,—pursued, he going to lay hold on me,—let me replace these tender limbs where they will be exposed to less inconveniencies.’ —‘Stand off,—rejoin'd I,—and tell me what you mean by this intrusion?’ 
‘Can a man intrude on what is his own? cried he,—are you not already mine by love,—and will not to-morrow make you so by law?—away then with this idle coyness;—there should now be no reserve between us;—be as wise as you are fair, and generously grant to night what to-morrow will give me power to seize;—leave nothing for the parson but to confirm the gift your inclination has previously bestowed;—this is the marriage of the souls, that of the hands is mere matter of form;—this alone can assure me of your affection, and by consequence engage the continuance of mine.’ 
“You will perhaps wonder, my dear miss Jessamy, pursued she, that I had patience to listen to so impudent a declaration, and did not rather attempt 
to put a stop to it by expressing the just abborrence and disdain I had of his behaviour; but, indeed, I was so much shock'd and confounded, that I believe, had he run on in the same strain even longer than he did, I should not have had the power to make the least reply. 
“Misconstruing, I suppose, my silence as a half approbation of what he had been urging, he took me in his arms, kiss'd, and press'd me to his bosom with the utmost vehemence, though I cannot say with any indecency. —I struggled,—burst into a flood of tears, but as yet was able to bring out no more than,”—‘Oh mr. Willmore, I never could have believed you would talk to me in this manner.’ 
‘I talk to you as a man of reason as well as a lover, answer'd he, and I would have you behave like a woman who has some share of both;—I do not despair, however, added he with an affected laugh, but to find my arguments will have more efficacy with you when we are in bed.’ 
“While he was speaking these words he made an offer of forcing me from 
the place where I was standing, and this action it was which first rous'd me from that stupid lethargy which amazement at his proceeding had thrown me into,”—‘Base man, cried I, unworthy of my least regard;—be assured I will rather plunge myself headlong from this window than be exposed one moment longer to such audacious insults;—therefore be gone,—leave me this instant, or I will raise the whole family with my shrieks.’ 
‘Mighty well, madam, said he with an air of derision,—'tis mighty well;—I see the respect you have for me;—and now will let you into the secret of my acting in the manner I have done;—you must know, that being perfectly acquainted with the sham tenderness with which your sex frequently impose upon us men, I made a resolution never to give up my liberty to any woman who would not convince me of her love by permitting me to enjoy her before marriage.’ 
‘Monster,—villain,—cried I, and was going on, but he prevented me.’ 
—‘No hard names, I beseech you, madam, said he, we men have as much vanity as you women can have,—and have as 
good a right too as yourselves to it;—we are as well pleased as you with being loved, and as malicious as you when we find we are not so;—you take a pride in triumphing over us, when you fancy you have us in your power, and whenever we have you in ours we should be asses not to make use of it;—you happen to be in mine, and tho' you do not love me, nor I care two-pence for you, I shall not take all this pains for nothing, nor come here to lie alone to night.’ 
“In concluding this fine speech,—he flew upon me like a lion, and sure it was providence alone which in that dreadful moment inspired me with an unusual strength and courage;—I broke from the hold he had taken on me, and ran screaming into the next room; but that would have availed me little, if in pursuing me his feet had not tangled in the carpet, and he fell at full length upon the floor,—this gave me opportunity to pull down the bars of one of the windows, open the shutter, and throw up the sash;—the villain's sword, which he had pull'd off on our persuading him to stay all night, lay just at my hand, I drew it, resolved to run it into his 
heart, if by no other means I could escape the violence he threatned;—he soon recover'd himself from the accident and was with me;—I stood on my defence with his own weapon pointed against his breast, calling out at the same time,—a rape,—thieves, murder,—fire, and every thing that I thought might alarm the neighbourhood;—he would fain have come near enough to me to have wrested the sword out of my hand, but I kept it still waving, and I could perceive he was pretty fearful of encountering the point:—the noise I made, however, brought the woman of the house up stairs,—she came running into the room with a candle in her hand, and affected to be greatly surprised to see Willmore there, and myself in the posture I was. 
“Had I been in any other situation than such as I then was, I must have laugh'd excessively at the sight of this old beldam, just risen from her bed, her head so cased with napkins that it almost rivalled the size of her enormous belly, which, stripp'd of the penthouse of her hoop-petticoat shew'd itself in its full magnitude,—the flannel bandages about her gouty legs, exposed 
by the shortness of a little red petticoat, which scarce reach'd below her knees, and her bow'd out back cover'd only with a thin toylet, which I suppose she had snatch'd up in the hurry of hearing me call out, render'd her certainly the most grotesque figure that ever eyes beheld. 
“Though it was doubtless this wretch's fears of being exposed, and not any compassion for me, that brought her to my relief, yet it must be owned her coming was very seasonable at this juncture, as my spirits as well as strength must inevitably have fail'd in a short time, and left me entirely destitute of all defence.” 
‘By what vile arts soever I have been decoy'd into your house, said I, as soon as I saw her enter,—I expect to be protected in it, and if I am not so, nothing but your murdering me shall prevent my applying to a magistrate for justice.’ 
“In spite of the confusion I was in myself, I could perceive she was most terribly alarm'd at my words, and the posture in which she found me.” 
—‘You shall not be murder'd,—you shall not be hurt, cried she, in a 
hoarse trembling voice,—no harm shall come to you in my house:—but pray what has happen'd to put you into this disorder?’ —‘Ask that villain there, who calls himself your nephew, return'd I, and thank him for the ill opinion I have of every thing that is here.’ 
“On this she took Willmore by the arm and drew him to a corner of the room where they talked together for the space of several minutes, but in such low and grumbling accents that I could hear nothing of what was said, till he, raising his voice a little cried,” ‘—It is not that I care a straw for the girl, but I hate to be baulk'd.’ —“she then spoke something to him very softly, on which he flung from her, and went out of the room, casting a most malicious look at me as he pass'd by. 
“As soon as he was gone,”—‘Dear madam, said she, approaching me, I am afflicted to the last degree that any thing should happen to disconcert you in my house,—sure the captain was drunk; but all is over now he is gone up to his own chamber, and I am sure, after what I have said to him, will not come down again to night;—therefore 
I beseech you give me leave to help you into bed,—you will certainly get cold in the night air.’ 
“I would have thanked her, for indeed I thought it best to behave civilly till I had got out of that cursed house, but I had not the power of speaking; the late terror I had been in being now a little subsided, a flood of other mingled passions overwhelm'd my heart, I threw myself into a chair and was ready to faint;—seeing my condition she ran and fetch'd a bottle of cordial water, which I took a little of and found myself refresh'd;—all she could say, however would not persuade me to go into bed;—I told her that the greatest obligation she could confer upon me, was to leave me to myself for the remainder of the night;—on which she retired, after giving me, on my desiring it, the keys of the dining-room and bed-chamber doors. 
“When I had secured myself as much as locks could make me, I began to give a loose to emotions, which, had they not found a vent in tears, must certainly have burst my heart and left me dead upon the spot; but I will not prolong my already too tedious 
narrative with any description of what I suffer'd, I shall only say, that I continued in a condition little inferior to madness till break of day, without once reflecting that I was almost naked, or of the dangers to which my health was exposed. 
“At last, however, I recover'd my senses enough to get on my cloaths, and to think of going from a place which had been the scene of so much horror to me:—hearing the maids were up, I ventured to unfasten my door and went down into the parlour, where I desired a wench that was sweeping the entry to call a coach for me, which she promised, but I found instead of doing so she went up directly to her mistress and told her my request, for the old beldam immediately came down, and asked me, in her fawning tone, if I would not please to stay breakfast; which I refusing,”—‘I hope madam, said she, you will take nothing amiss from me, I am sorry to the very soul that you should meet with any thing in my house to disoblige you;—I do assure you I have rattled the captain soundly about it,—he confesses he was in liquor, and will beg your pardon.’ 
‘I want no submissions from him, answer'd I, nor will I ever see him more;—but you may tell him, that I expect he will send me a bond for the money he borrow'd of me.’ —‘I am quite a stranger, cried she, to all affairs between you; but I will go up directly and let him know what you say;’—“with these words she left me, I suppose with the intent she mentioned. 
“The moment she was gone, a hackney coach came to the door,—two young women gaily dress'd, bolted out of it;—I presently knew them, by the pictures I had seen above, for those she called her daughters; though, indeed, their faces had nothing of that innocence which the painter had bestowed upon them;—they stared at me as they passed by the parlour door, but said nothing, and ran singing up stairs;—in fine,—they had all the marks of their profession about them; and the very sight of them would have convinced me, if I had doubted of it before, into what sort of a house the villain Willmore had seduced me. 
“The coach that brought them not being yet gone from the door, I thought 
best to take this opportunity of going away, without waiting to hear what answer Willmore would give to my message by his pretended aunt,—I was just stepping in when she came down, and told me that the captain was asleep at present, but that as soon as he awoke she would not fail to deliver to him what I had said. —I replied, that it was no matter, I should find other means to send to him,—and then bid the coachman drive to Piccadilly. 
“The fatigue I had sustain'd the night before, and the hurry of spirits I was still in, render'd me very unfit to be seen by any of my acquaintance, I therefore resolved to go directly home, and as I knew not but the stage might be already set out, or if not so was equally uncertain of getting a place in it, I hired a chariot at Bullamor's: —I found myself very much indisposed during all this little journey, and on my arrival grew so extremely ill that I was obliged to be let blood; but this was far from giving me any relief, I fell the next morning into a fever, in which I continued eleven days, without hope of recovery. 
“If the extremest bitterness of heart,—if shame and remorse for having ever loved a man so unworthy of it,—if rage and disdain at the insults I had received, were capable of killing I could not have surviv'd;—yet so it was,—my distemper left me at the expiration of the time I mentioned, and I regain'd my health, though, indeed, by very slow degrees, for it was near a month before I was able to quit my chamber. 
“In all this time I received no bond, nor even letter from Willmore; therefore, as soon as I was fit to see company, I sent for a lawyer who was a friend of my brother's, and when he was at home had often visited at our house;—I told him my unhappy story, as far as relates to the money I had lent, and desired he would commence a prosecution against Willmore on that account;—but when he found that I had neither bond, promissory note, nor other obligation under his own hand-writing, nor even any one witness of the loan, he assured me at once, that if the gentleman had not honour enough to pay the debt I must infallibly lose it, for law could give me no relief:—perceiving I was extremely 
shock'd at what he said, he told me that if I would make a demand of the money in writing he would carry it to him, and hear what answer he would make to it;—though it was death to me to set pen to paper to such a villain, my unwillingness that he should run away with almost half of my fortune made me comply with this proposal, and I wrote to him, as near as I can remember, in these terms:” 

To capt. George Willmore.
Sir,
I have employ'd this gentleman to take such security as he shall think sufficient from you, for a thousand pounds lent you by me on the fourth day of last month; or, on your refusing to give it, to pursue such methods as the law provides to compel you to do justice to 
“The ill-treated,
Sophia, *** 

“The lawyer approved of what I wrote,—said he would argue with Willmore upon it, and as soon as he had done so wait on me again with the result of their conversation. 
“As he had told me, and I myself had always believed, that the recovery of my money depended wholly on the honour of the person to whom I had lent it, you may suppose I could not flatter myself with the least hopes of success, so was not disappointed, when, at the end of ten days, my lawyer return'd and gave an account, that the monster Willmore had utterly denied the whole affair, and treated both me and my demand with the greatest contempt. 
‘I am very much surprised, madam, said this gentleman to me, that you should venture so large a sum of money in the hands of any one without an acknowledgment of the receipt in some shape or other, much more in those of a person such as captain Willmore;—for to deal plainly with you, I have enquired into his character, and find he is one of those sparks who are distinguish'd by the name of Bucks,—a species of the creation who are scarce worthy of the name of men, yet would fain be thought heroes;—fellows that run about the streets with great clubs in their hands, and swords by their sides as long as themselves, frighting 
women and children and affecting to be ridiculously terrible.’ 
“I was a little picqued at this description of a man who had once appeared but too agreeable to me;—I said nothing, however, but that since it was so, I must be content to lose my money;—I was willing, notwithstanding, to make some farther enquiry what could be done; and accordingly, as soon as he was gone, came to London, where I had the advice of three several council; but they all agreeing in what the first had told me, I was convinced that all attempts to do myself justice would be in vain, and only serve to expose me to the ridicule of the world. 
“England now grew hateful to me, and I took a resolution to leave it, and throw myself into a new scene of life;—a young lady of my acquaintance being lately gone to a convent at Brussels, I wrote to her, desiring she would make an agreement for me with the superiors, which she having done very much to my satisfaction, I discharged the servants in the country, gave up the house to my brother's 
friend, and have now nothing to do but to depart. 
“In the midst of all these embarrassments, continued she, I did not forget my dear miss Jessamy;—I was twice to wait on you, but was informed you were at Bath, and not expecting your return till the end of the season, I despaired of the satisfaction I have now enjoyed, both in seeing you, and in disburthening myself of that load of afflictions with which I have been oppress'd since last I had the pleasure of your company.”
