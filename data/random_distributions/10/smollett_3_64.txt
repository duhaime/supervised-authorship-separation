Pallet, endeavouring to unravel the mystery of the
treatment he had received, falls out of the frying
pan into the fire. 
Nevertheless, Pallet was still confounded,
and chagrined by one consideration, which
was no other than that of his having been so
roughly handled in the chamber, belonging (as
he found upon enquiry) to the handsome young
lady, who was under the Capuchin's direction. 
He recollected, that the door was fast locked,
when his beast burst it open, and he had no reason
to believe that any person followed him in his
irruption: on the other hand, he could not imagine,
that such a gentle creature would either
attempt to commit, or be able to execute such a
desperate assault as that which his body had sustained; 
and her demeanor was so modest and
circumspect, that he durst not harbour the least
suspicion of her virtue. 
These reflexions bewildered him in the labyrinth
of thought: he rummaged his whole imagination,
endeavouring to account for what had
happened; and at length concluded, that either
Peregrine, or the devil, or both, must have
been at the bottom of the whole affair, and determined,
for the satisfaction of his curiosity, to
watch our hero's motions, during the remaining
part of the night, so narrowly, that his conduct, 

mysterious as it was, should not be able to elude
his penetration. 
With these sentiments he retired to his own
room, after the ass had been restored to the
right owners, and the priest had visited and confirmed
his fair ward, who had been almost distracted
with fear; and silence no sooner prevailed
again, than he crawled darkling towards her
door, and huddled himself up in an obscure corner,
from whence he might observe the ingress
or egress of any human creaure. He had not
long remained in this posture, when, fatigued
with this adventure, and that of the preceding
night, his faculties were gradually overpowered
with slumber, and falling fast asleep, he began
to snore like a whole congregation of presbyterians. 
The Flemish beauty, hearing this discordant
noise in the passage, began to be afraid of
some new alarm, and very prudently bolted her
door; so that when her lover wanted to repeat
his visit, he was not only surprised and incensed
at this disagreeable serenade, the author of which
he did not know; but when, compelled by his
passion, which was by this time wound to the
highest pitch, he ventured to approach the entrance,
he had the extreme mortification to find
himself shut out; and he durst not knock, or
signify his presence in any other manner, on account
of the lady's reputation, which would have
greatly suffered, had the snorer been waked by
his endeavours. Had he known that the person
who thus thwarted his views, was the painter,
he would have taken some effectual step to remove
him; but he could not conceive what
should induce Pallet to take up his residence in
that corner; nor could he use the assistance of a 

light, to distinguish him, because there was not
a candle burning in the house; and besides, the
sleeper might have opened his eyes in the very
moment of his being detected by Peregrine, who
would have incurred suspicion, by appearing, at
such an hour, at that part of the inn, so remote
from his own bed-chamber. 
It is impossible to describe the rage and vexation
of our hero, while he continued thus tantalized
upon the brink of bliss, after his desire had
been exasperated by the circumstances of his two
former disappointments. He ejaculated a thousand
execrations against his own fortune, cursed
all his fellow-travellers, without exception, vowed
revenge against the painter, who had twice
confounded his most interesting scheme, and was
tempted to execute immediate vengeance upon
the unknown cause of his present misadventure. 
In this agony of distraction did he sweat two
whole hours in the passage, though not without
some faint hope of being delivered from his tormentor,
who (he imagined) upon waking, would
undoubtedly shift his quarters, and leave the field
free to his designs; but when he heard the cock
repeat his salutation to the morn, which began
to open on the rear of night, he could no longer
restrain his indignation, but going to his own
chamber, filled a basin with cold water, and,
standing at some distance, discharged it full in
the face of the gaping snorer, who, over and
above the surprize occasioned by the application,
was almost suffocated by the liquor that entered
his mouth, and ran down into his wind-pipe. 
While he gasped like a person half drowned,
without knowing the nature of his disaster, or
remembring the situation in which he fell asleep; 

Peregrine retired to his own door, and, to his no
small astonishment, from a long howl that invaded
his ears, learnt that the patient was no
other than Pallet, who had now, for the third
time, baulked his good fortune. 
Enraged at the complicated trespasses of this
unfortunate offender, he rushed from his apartment
with a horse-whip, and encountering the
painter in his flight, overturned him in the passage,
and exercised the instrument of his wrath
with great severity, on pretence of mistaking
him for some presumptuous cur, which had disturbed
the repose of the inn; nay, when he
called aloud for mercy in a supplicating tone, and
his chastiser could no longer pretend to treat him
as a quadruped, such was the virulence of the
young gentleman's indignation, that he could
not help declaring his satisfaction, by telling Pallet
he had richly deserved the punishment he had undergone,
for his madness, folly and impertinence,
in contriving and executing such idle schemes, as
had no other tendency than that of plaguing his
neighbours. 
Pallet protested with great vehemence, that he
was innocent as the child unborn of any intention
to give umbrage to any person whatever,
except the Israelite and his doxy, who he knew
had incurred his displeasure. “But, as God is
my Saviour! (said he) I believe I am persecuted
with witchcraft, and begin to think that damn'd
priest is an agent of the devil; for he has been
but two nights in our company, during which I
have not closed an eye, but on the contrary have
been tormented by all the fiends of hell.” Pickle
peevishly replied, that his torments had been occasioned
by his own foolish imagination; and 

asked how he came to howl in that corner. The
painter, who did not think proper to own the
truth, said, that he had been transported thither
by some preternatural conveyance, and soused in
water by an invisible hand: and the youth, in
hope of profiting by his absence, advised him to
retire immediately to his bed, and by sleep strive
to comfort his brain, which seemed to be not a
little disordered by the want of that refreshment. 
Pallet himself began to be very much of the same
way of thinking, and in compliance with such
wholesome counsel, betook himself to rest, muttering
prayers all the way for the recovery of his
understanding. 
Pickle attended him to his chamber, and locking
him up, put the key in his own pocket, that
he might not have it in his power to interrupt
him again: but in his return he was met by Mr.
Jolter and the doctor, who had been a second
time alarmed by the painter's cries, and come thither
to inquire about this new adventure. Half
frantic with such a series of disappointments, he
cursed them in his heart for their unseasonable appearance; 
and when they questioned him about
Pallet, told them he had found him stark staring
mad, howling in a corner and wet to the skin,
and conducted him to his room, where he was
now abed. The physician hearing this circumstance,
made a merit of his vanity, and under
pretence of concern for the patient's welfare, desired
he might have an opportunity of examining
the symptoms of his disorder, without loss of
time; alledging, that many diseases might have
been stifled in the birth, which afterwards baffled
all the endeavours of the medical art. The young
gentleman accordingly delivered the key, and 

once more withdrew into his own chamber, with
a view of seizing the first occasion that should
present itself of renewing his application to his
Amanda's door; while the doctor, in his way to
Pallet's apartment, hinted to the governor his
suspicion, that the patient laboured under that
dreadful symptom called the hydrophobia, which
he observed had sometimes appeared in persons
who were not previously bit by a mad dog. This
conjecture he founded upon the howl he uttered
when he was soused with water, and began to
recollect certain circumstances of the painter's
behaviour for some day's past, which now he
could plainly perceive had prognosticated some
such calamity. He then ascribed the distemper
to the violent frights he had lately undergone,
affirmed that the affair of the Bastile had made
such a violent incroachment upon his understanding,
that his manner of thinking and speaking
was intirely altered; and by a theory of his own
invention, explained the effects of fear upon a
loose system of nerves, and demonstrated the
modus in which the animal spirits operate upon
the ideas and power of imagination. 
This disquisition, which was communicated
at the painter's door, might have lasted till breakfast,
had not Jolter reminded him of his own
maxim, Venienti occurrite morbo; upon which he
put the key to immediate use, and they walked
softly towards the bed, where the patient lay extended
at full length in the arms of slumber. 
The physician took notice of his breathing hard,
and his mouth being open; and from these diagnostics
declared, that the liquidum nervosum was
intimately affected, and the saliva impregnated
with the spiculated particles of the virus, howsoever 

contracted. This sentence was still farther
confirmed by the state of his pulse, which being
full and slow, indicated an oppressed circulation,
from a loss of elasticity in the propelling arteries; 
and he proposed, that he should immediately
suffer a second aspersion of water, which would
not only contribute to the cure, but also certify
them beyond all possibility of doubt, with regard
to the state of the disease: for it would evidently
appear, from the manner in which he would bear
the application, whether or not his horror of water
amounted to a confirmed hydrophobia. Mr. Jolter,
in compliance with this proposal, began to empty
a bottle of water, which he found in the room
in a basin; when he was interrupted by the prescriber,
who advised him to use the contents of
the chamber-pot, which being impregnated with
salt, would operate more effectually than pure
element. Thus directed, the governor lifted up
the vessel, which was replete with medicine, and
with one turn of his hands discharged the whole
healing inundation upon the ill-omen'd patient,
who waking in the utmost distraction of horror,
yelled most hideously, just at the time when Peregrine
had brought his mistress to a parley, and
entertained hopes of being admitted into her
chamber. 
Terrified at this exclamation, she instantly
broke off the treaty, beseeching him to retire
from the door, that her honour might receive no
injury from his being found in that place; and
he had just enough of recollection left to see the
necessity of obeying the order; in conformity to
which he retreated, well nigh deprived of his
senses, and almost persuaded, that so many unaccountable
disappointments must have proceeded 

from some supernatural cause, of which the idiot
Pallet was no more than the involuntary instrument. 
Mean while, the doctor having ascertained the
malady of the patient, whose cries, interrupted
by frequent sobs and sighs, he interpreted into the
barking of a dog; having no more salt-water at
hand, resolved to renew the bath with such materials
as chance would afford, and actually laid
hold of the bottle and basin. But by this time,
the painter had recovered the use of his senses so
well, as to perceive his drift; and starting up,
like a frantic Bedlamite, ran directly to his sword,
swearing with many horrid imprecations, that he
would murder them both immediately, if he
should be hanged before dinner. They did not
choose to wait the issue of his threat, but retired
with such precipitation, that the physician had almost
dislocated his shoulder, by running against
one side of the entry; and Jolter having pulled
the door after him, and turned the key, betook
himself to flight, roaring aloud for assistance. His
collegue seeing the door secured, valued himself
upon his resolution, and exhorted him to return; 
declaring, that for his own part, he was more
afraid of the madman's teeth than of his weapon,
and admonishing the governor to re-enter, and
execute what they had left undone; “Go in (said
he) without fear or apprehension, and if any accident
shall happen to you, either from his slaver
or his sword, I will assist you with my advice,
which from this station I can more coolly and distinctly
administer, than I should be able to supply,
if my ideas were disturbed, or my attention
engaged in any personal concern.” 

Jolter, who could make no objection to the
justness of the conclusion, frankly owned, that
he had no inclination to try the experiment; observing,
that self preservation was the first law
of nature; that his connexions with the unhappy
lunatic were but slight, and that it could not be
reasonably expected, that he would run such risks
for his service, as were declined by one who had
set out with him from England on the footing of
a companion. This insinuation introduced a dispute
upon the nature of benevolence and the
moral sense, which (the republican argued) existed
independent of any private consideration,
and could never be affected by any contingent
circumstance of time and fortune; while the
other, who abhorred his principles, asserted the
duties and excellence of private friendship, with
infinite rancour of altercation. 
During the hottest of the argument, they were
joined by the Capuchin, who being astonished to
see them thus virulently engaged at the door, and
to hear the painter bellowing within the chamber,
conjured them in the name of God to tell him
the cause of that confusion, which had kept the
whole house in continual alarm during the best
part of the night, and seemed to be the immediate
work of the devil and his angels. When the
governor gave him to understand, that Pallet was
visited with an evil spirit, he muttered a prayer
of St. Antonio de Padua, and undertook to cure
the painter, provided he could be secured so as
that he might, without danger to himself, burn
part of a certain relick under his nose, which he
assured them was equal to the miraculous power
of Eleazar's ring. They expressed great curiosity
to know what this treasure was; and the priest 

was prevailed upon to tell them in confidence,
that it was a collection of the parings of the nails
belonging to those two madmen whom Jesus
purged of the legion of devils that afterwards entered
the swine. So saying, he pulled from one
of his pockets a small box, containing about an
ounce of the parings of an horse's hoof; at sight
of which, the governor could not help smiling,
on account of the grossness of the imposition; 
and the doctor asked, with a supercilious smile,
whether those maniacs whom Jesus cured, were
of the sorrel complexion, or dapple grey; for,
from the texture of these parings, he could prove,
that the original owners were of the quadruped
order, and even distinguish, that their feet had
been fortified with shoes of iron. 
The mendicant, who bore an inveterate grudge
against this son of Æsculapius, ever since he had
made so free with the catholic religion, replied
with great bitterness, that he was a wretch with
whom no Christian ought to communicate; that
the vengeance of heaven would one day overtake
him, on account of his profanity; and that his
heart was shod with a metal much harder than
iron, which he was afraid nothing but hell-fire
would be able to melt. 
It was now broad day, and all the servants of
the inn were afoot. Peregrine, seeing it would be
impossible to obtain any sort of indemnification
for the time he had lost, and the perturbation of
his spirits hindering him from enjoying repose,
which was, moreover, obstructed by the noise
of Pallet and his attendants, put on his cloaths at
once, and in exceeding ill humour arrived at the
spot where this triumvirate stood debating about
the means of overpowering the furious painter, 

who still continued his song of oaths and execrations,
and made sundry efforts to break open the
door. Chagrin'd as our hero was, he could not
help laughing when he heard how the patient had
been treated; and his indignation changing into
compassion, he called to him through the keyhole,
desiring to know the reason of his distracted
behaviour. Pallet no sooner recognized his voice,
than lowering his own to a whimpering tone,
“My dear friend! (said he) I have at last detected
the ruffians who have persecuted me so
much. I caught them in the fact of suffocating
me with cold water; and by the Lord! I will
be revenged, or may I never live to finish my
Cleopatra. For the love of God! open the door,
and I will make that conceited pagan, that pretender
to taste, that false devotee of the ancients,
who poisons people with sillykickabies and devil's
dung; I say, I will make him a monument of
my wrath, and an example to all the cheats and
impostors of the faculty: and as for that thick-headed
insolent pedant his confederate, who
emptied my own jordan upon me while I slept,
he had better have been in his beloved Paris,
botching schemes for his friend the pretender,
than incurred the effects of my resentment. 
Gadsbodikins! I won't leave him a wind-pipe for
the hangman to stop, at the end of another rebellion.” 
Pickle told him, that his conduct had been so
extravagant, as to confirm the whole company
in the belief, that he was actually deprived of his
senses; on which supposition, Mr. Jolter and the
doctor had acted the part of friends, in doing that
which they thought most couoncive to his recovery; 
so that their concern merited his thankful 

acknowledgment, instead of his frantic menaces:
and that for his own part, he would be the first
to condemn him, as one utterly bereft of his wits,
and give orders for his being secured as a madman,
unless he would immediately give a proof
of his sanity, by laying aside his sword, composing
his spirits, and thanking his injured friends
for their care of his person. 
This alternative quieted his transports in a moment; 
he was terrified at the apprehension of
being treated like a Bedlamite, being dubious of
the state of his own brain; and on the other
hand, had conceived such an horror and antipathy
for his tormentors, that, far from believing
himself obliged by what they had done, he could
not even think of them without the utmost rage
and detestation. He therefore, in the most tranquil
voice he could assume, protested, that he
never was less out of his senses than at present,
though he did not know how long he might retain
them, if he should be considered in the light
of a lunatic; and that, in order to prove his being
compos mentis, he was willing to sacrifice the resentment
be so justly harboured against those who
by their malice had brought him to this pass:
but, as he apprehended, it would be the greatest
sign of madness he could exhibit, to thank them
for the mischiefs they had brought upon him, he
desired to be excused from making any such concession,
and swore he would endure every thing,
rather than be guilty of such mean absurdity. 
Peregrine held a consultation upon this reply,
when the governor and physician strenuously argued
against any capitulation with a maniac, and
proposed that some method might be taken to
seize, fetter and convey him into a dark room, 

where he might be treated according to the rules
of art. But the Capuchin understanding the circumstances
of the case, undertook to restore him
to his former state, without having recourse to
such violent measures: and Pickle, who was a
better judge of the affair than any person present,
opened the door without further hesitation, and
displayed the poor painter standing with a woeful
countenance, shivering in his shirt, which was as
wet as if he had been dragged through the Dender; 
a spectacle which gave such offence to the
chaste eyes of the Hebrew's mistress, who was
by this time one of the spectators, that she turned
her head another way, and withdrew to her own
room, exclaiming against the indecent practices
of men. 
Pallet, seeing the young gentleman enter, ran
to him, and shaking him by the hand, called him
his best friend, and said he had rescued him from
those who had a design against his life. The
priest would have produced his parings, and applied
them to his nose; but was hindered by
Pickle, who advised the patient to shift himself,
and put on his cloaths: and this being done with
great order and deliberation, Mr. Jolter, who,
with the doctor, had kept at a wary distance, in
expectation of seeing some strange effects of his
distraction, began to believe that he had been
guilty of a mistake, and accused the physician of
having misled him by his false diagnostic. The
doctor still insisted upon his former declaration,
assuring him, that although Pallet enjoyed a short
interval for the present, the delirium would soon
recur, unless they would profit by this momentary
calm, and order him to be blooded, blistered and
purged with all imaginable dispatch. 

The governor, however, notwithstanding this
caution, advanced to the injured party, and begg'd
pardon for the share he had in giving him such disturbance,
declaring in the most solemn manner,
that he had no other intention than that of contributing
towards his welfare, and that his behaviour
was the result of the physician's prescription,
which he affirmed was absolutely necessary
for the recovery of his health. 
The painter, who had very little gall in his
disposition, was satisfied with this apology; but
his resentment, which was before divided, now
glowed with double fire against his first fellow-traveller,
whom he looked upon as the author of
all the mischances he had undergone, and marked
out for his vengeance accordingly. Yet the doors
or reconciliation were not shut against the doctor,
who with great justice might have transferred
this load of offence from himself to Peregrine,
who was, without doubt, the source of the
painter's misfortune: but, in that case, he must
have owned himself mistaken in his medical capacity; 
and he did not think the friendship of
Pallet important enough to sway him to such
condescension; so that he resolved to neglect him
intirely, and gradually forget the former correspondence
he had maintained with a person whom
he deemed so unworthy of his notice.
