Fathom being safely housed, the reader is entertained
with a retrospect. 
But now it is high time to leave our adventurer
to chew the cud of reflexion and
remorse in this solitary mansion, that we may
trace Renaldo in the several steps he took to
assert his right, and do justice to his family. 
Never man indulged a more melancholy train
of ideas than that which accompaied him in
his journey to the Imperial court: for notwithstanding
the manifold reasons he had to
expect an happy issue to his aim, his imagination
was incessantly infected with something that
chilled his nerves, and saddened his heart, recurring,
with quick succession, like the unwearied
wave that beats upon the bleak, inhospitable
Greenland shore. This, the reader
will easily suppose, was no other than the remembrance
of the forlorn Monimia, whose
image appeared to his fancy in different attitudes
according to the prevelance of the passions which
raged in his bosom. Sometimes he viewed her
in the light of apostacy, and then his soul was
maddened with indignation and despair; but
these transitory blasts were not able to efface
the impressions she had formerly made upon 

his heart; impressions which he had so often
and so long contemplated with inconvincible
rapture. These pictures still remained, representing
her fair as the most perfect idea of
beauty, soft and tender as an angel of mercy
and compassion, warmed with every virtue of
the heart, and adorned with every accomplishment
of human nature; yet the alarming
contrast came still in the rear of this recollection; 
so that his soul was by turns agitated
by the tempests of horror, and overwhelmed
by the floods of grief. 
He recalled the moment on which he first
beheld her, with that pleasing regret which
attends the memory of a dear deceased friend; 
then he bitterly cursed it, as the source of all
his misfortunes and affliction; he thanked
heaven for having blessed him with a friend
to detect her perfidy and ingratitude; then
ardently wished he had still continued under
the influence of her delusion. In a word, the
loneliness of his situation aggravated every
horror of his reflection; for, as he found himself
without company, his imagination was never
sollicited, or his attention diverted from
these subjects of woe; and he travelled to
Brussels in a reverie, fraught with such torments
as must have entirely wrecked his reason,
had not providence interposed in his
behalf. He was, by his postilion, conducted
to one of the best inns in the place, where he
understood the cloth was already laid for supper; 
and as the ordinary is open to strangers,
in all those houses of entertainment, he introduced
himself into the company, with a view
to alleviate, in some measure, his sorrow and
chagrin, by the conversation of his fellow 

guests; yet he was so ill prepared to obtain the
relief which he courted, that he entered the
apartment, and sat down to table, without distinguishing
either the number or countenances
of those who were present; though he
himself did not remain so unregarded. His
mein and deportment produced a prepossession
in his favour; and the air of affliction, so
remarkable in his visage, did not fail to attract
their sympathy and observation. 
Among the rest, was an Irish officer, in the
Austrian service, who having eyed Renaldo
attentively, “Sir, (said he, rising) if my eyes
and memory do not deceive me, you are the
count de Melvile, with whom I had the honour
to serve upon the Rhine, during the last
war.” The youth hearing his own name mentioned,
lifted up his eyes, and at once recognizing
the other to be a gentleman who had
been a captain in his father's regiment, ran
forwards, and embraced him with great affection. 
This was, in divers respects, a fortunate rencounter
for young Melvile; as the officer was
not only perfectly well acquainted with the situation
of the count's family, but also resolved,
in a few days, to set out for Vienna, whether
he promised to accompany Renaldo, as soon
as he understood his route lay the same way. 
Before the day fixed for their departure arrived,
this gentleman found means to insinuate
himself so far into the confidence of the count,
as to learn the cause of that distress which he had
observed in his features at their first meeting; 
and being a gentleman of uncommon vivacity,
as well as sincerely attached to the family of
Melvile, to which he had owed his promotion; 

he exerted all his good humour and good
sense; in amusing the fancy, and reasoning
down the mortification of the afflicted Hungarian. 
He, in particular, endeavoured to
wean his attention from the lost Monimia, by
engaging it upon his domestic affairs, and upon
the wrongs of his mother and sister, who, he
gave him to understand, were languishing under
the tyranny of his father-in-law. 
This was a note that effectually roused him
from the lethargy of his sorrow; and the desire
of taking vengeance on the oppressor, who
had ruined his fortune, and made his nearest
relations miserable, so entirely engrossed his
thoughts, as to leave no room for other considerations. 
During their journey to Austria,
major Farrel (that was the name of his fellow
traveller) informed him of many circumstances
touching his father's house, to which himself
was an utter stranger. 
“The conduct of your mother, said he, in
marrying count Trebasi, was not at all agreeable
either to the friends of the count Melvile,
or to her own relations, who knew her second
husband to be a man of a violent temper,
and rapacious disposition, which the nature
of his education and employment, had
served rather to inflame than allay; for you
well know he was a partizan during the whole
course of the late war. They were, moreover,
equally surprised and chagrined, when they
found she took no step to prevent his seizing
upon that inheritance which of right belonged
to you, and which, by the laws of Hungary,
is unalienable from the heir of blood: nevertheless,
they are now fully convinced, that
she hath more than sufficiently attoned for her 

indiscretion, by the barbarity of her husband,
who hath not only secluded her from all communication
with her friends and acquaintance,
but even confined her to the west tower of your
father's house, where she is said to be kept
close prisoner, and subjected to all sorts of inconvenience
and mortification. This severity
she is believed to have incurred, in consequence
of having expostulated with him upon his unjust
behaviour to you and mademoiselle, whom
he hath actually shut up in some convent in
Vienna, which your relations have not as yet
been able to discover: but the memory of
your noble father is so dear to all those who
were favoured with his friendship; and the
sufferings of the countess and mademoiselle
have raised such a spirit of resentment against
her cruel jailor, that nothing is wanted but
your presence, to begin the prosecution, and
give a sanction to the measures of your friends,
which will, in a little time, restore your family
to the fruition of its rights and fortune:
for my own part, my dear count, I consider
myself as one wholly indebted to your house,
for the rank and expectation I now enjoy, and
my finances, interest, and person, such as they
are, I dedicate to your service.” 
Renaldo was not slow in making his acknowledgements
to this generous Hibernian, whom
he informed of his scheme, recounting to him
his uncommon transaction with the benevolent
Jew, and communicating the letters of recommendation
he had received by his means, to
some of the first noblemen at the Imperial
court. Mean while, he burned with impatience,
to chastise count Trebasi for his perfidious
conduct to the widow and the fatherless, 

and would have taken the road to Presburg,
without touching at Vienna, in order to call
him to a severe account, had not he been strenuously
opposed by Major Farrel, who represented
the imprudence of taking such a step
before he had secured a proper protection
from the consequences with which it might be
attended. 
“It is not,” said he, “your own life and
fortune only which depend upon your behaviour
in this emergency, but also the quiet and
happiness of those who are most dear to your
affection; not you alone, but likewise your
mother and sister would infallibly suffer by
your temerity and precipitation. First of all,
deliver your credentials at court, and let us
join our endeavours to raise an interest strong
enough to counterbalance that of Trebasi. If
we succeed, there will be no necessity for having
recourse to personal measures: he will be
compelled to yield up your inheritance which
he unjustly detains, and to restore your sister
to your arms; and if he afterwards refuses to
do justice to the countess, you will always have
it in your power to evince yourself the son of
the brave count de Melvile.” 
These just and salutary representations had
a due effect upon Renaldo, who no sooner arrived
at the capital of Austria, than he waited
upon a certain prince of distinction, to whose
patronage he was recommended; and from
whom he met with a very cordial reception,
not only on account of his credentials, but
also for the sake of his father, who was well
known to his highness. He heard his complaints
with great patience and affability, assured
him of his assistance and protection, and 

even undertook to introduce him to the empress
queen, who would not suffer the weakest
of her subjects to be oppressed, much less
disregard the cause of an injured young nobleman,
who by his own services and those of his
family was peculiarly intitled to her favour. 
Nor was he the only person whose countenance
and patronage Melvile sollicited upon
this occasion; he visited all the friends of his
father, and all his mother's relations, who
were easily interested in his behalf; while major
Farrel contributed all his efforts in strengthening
the association. So that a law-suit was
immediately commenced against count Trebasi,
who on his side was not idle, but prepared with
incredible industry for the assault, resolving to
maintain with his whole power the acquisition
he had made. 
The laws of Hungary, like those of some
other countries I could name, afford so many
subterfuges for the purposes of perfidy and
fraud, that it is no wonder our youth began to
complain of the slow progress of his affair; 
especially as he glowed with the most eager desire
of redressing the grievances of his parent
and sister, whose sufferings he did not doubt
were doubled since the institution of his process
against their tormentor. He imparted his
sentiments on this head to his friend; and, as
his apprehension every moment increased,
plainly told him he could no longer live without
making some effort to see those with whom
he was so nearly connected in point of blood
and affection: he therefore resolved to repair
immediately to Presburg, and according to
the intelligence he should procure, essay to see
and converse with his mother, tho' at the hazard
of his life.
