My Lord,
I Humbly beg leave to offer you
these two Volumes; they are
the best my talents, with such bad
health as I have, could produce:â€” 
had providence granted me a larger
stock of either, they had been a
much more proper present to your
Lordship. 

I beg your Lordship will forgive
me, if, at the same time I dedicate
this work to you, I join Lady
Spencer, in the liberty I take of
inscribing the story of Le Fever in
the sixth volume to her name; for
which I have no other motive, which
my heart has informed me of, but
that the story is a humane one. 
I am,
My Lord,
Your Lordship's
Most devoted,
And most humble Servant. 
Laur. Sterne.
