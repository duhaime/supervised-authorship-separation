Fresh cause for exerting his equanimity and fortitude. 
The reader may have observed, that Fathom
with all his circumspection, had a
weak side, which exposed him to sundry mischances:
this was his covetousness, which on
some occasions became too hard for his discretion:
at this period of time, it was, by the circumstances
of his situation, inflamed to a degree
of rapacity. He was now prevailed upon to
take a hand at whist or piquet, and even to
wield the hazard box; though he had hitherto
declared himself an irrecondileable enemy to
all sorts of play, and so uncommon was his
success and dexterity at these exercises, as to
surprize his acquaintance, and arouse the suspicion
of some people, who repined at his prosperity. 
But in nothing was his conduct more inexcusable,
than in giving way to the dangerous
temerity of Ratchkali, which he had been always
at pains to restrain, and permitting him to
practise the same fraud upon an English nobleman; 
which had been executed upon himself
at Franckfort. In other words, the Tyroleze
by the canal of Ferdinand's finger and recommendation,
sold a pebble for a real brilliant,
and in a few days the cheat was discovered, to
the infinite confusion of our adventurer, who
nevertheless assumed the guise of innocence
with so much art, and expressed such indignation
against the villain who had imposed 

upon his judgment and unsuspecting generosity,
that his lordship acquitted him of any share in the
deceit and contented himself with the restitution,
which he insisted upon making out of his own
pocket, until he should be able to apprehend
the rogue, who had thought proper to abscond
for his own safety. In spite of all this exculpation,
his character did not fail to retain a
sort of stigma, which indeed the plainest proofs
of innocence are hardly able to efface; and
his connexion with such a palpable knave as
the Tyroleze appeared to be, had an effect to
his prejudlce, in the minds of all those who
were privy to the occurrence. 
When a man's reputation is once brought in
question, every trifle is, by the malevolence of
mankind, magnified into a strong presumption
against the culprit: a few whispers communicated
by the envious mouth of slander, which
he can have no opportunity to answer and refute,
shall, in the opinion of the world, convict
him of the most horrid crimes, and for one hypocrite
who is decked with the honours of virtue,
there are twenty good men who suffer the
ignominy of vice; so well disposed are individuals
to trample upon the fame of their fellow-creatures. 
If the most unblemished merit is not
protected from this injustice, it will not be wondered
at, that no quarter was given to the character
of an adventurer like Fathom, who among
other unlucky occurrences, had the misfortune
to be recognized about this time, by his
two Parisian friends Sir Stentor Stiles and Sir
Giles Squirrel. 
These worthy knights-errant had returned to
their own country, after having made a very 

prosperous campaign in France, at the end of
which, however, they very narrowly escaped
the gaillies; and seeing the Polish count seated
at the head of taste and politeness, they immediately
circulated the story of his defeat at
Paris, with many ludicrous circumstances of
their own invention, and did not scruple to affirm
that he was a rank imposter. When the
laugh is raised upon a great man, he never
fails to dwindle into contempt. Ferdinand began
to perceive a change in the countenance of
his friends. His company was no longer solicited
with that eagerness which they had formerly
expressed in his behalf: even his entertainments
were neglected; when he appeared
at any private or public assembly, the ladies,
instead of glowing with pleasure as formerly,
now tittered or regarded him with looks of disdain; 
and a certain pert, little, forward coquette,
with a view to put him out of countenance
by raising the laugh at his expence, asked
him one night, at a drum, when he had heard
from his relations in Poland? She succeeded in
her design upon the mirth of the audience, but
was disappointed in the other part of her aim; 
for our hero replied without the least mark of
discomposure, “They are all in good health at
your service, madam; I wish I knew in what
part of the world your relations reside, that I
might return the compliment.” By this answer,
which was the more severe, as the young lady
was of very doubtful extraction, he retorted
the laugh upon the aggressor, though he likewise
failed in his attempt upon her temper; 
for she was perhaps the only person present,
who equall'd himself in stability of countenance. 

Notwithstanding this appearance of unconcern,
he was deeply touched with these marks
of alienation, in the behaviour of his friends,
and foreseeing in his own disgrace, the total
shipwreck of his fortune, be entered into a melancholy
deliberation with himself, about the
means of retrieving his importance in the beau-monde,
or of turning his address into some
other channel, where he could stand upon a less
slippery foundation. In this exercise of his
thoughts, no scheme occurred more feasible,
than that of securing the booty he had made,
and retiring with his associate, who was also
blown, into some other country, where, their
names and characters being unknown, they
might pursue their old plan of commerce without
molestation. He imparted this suggestion
to the Tyroleze, who approved the proposal of
decamping, though he combated with all his
might our hero's inclination to withdraw himself
before the trial, by repeating the assurances
of the solicitor, who told him he might depend
upon being reimbursed by the sentence of
the court, for great part of the sums he had
expended in the course of the prosecution. 
Fathom suffered himself to be persuaded by
these arguments, supported with the desire of
making an honourable retreat, and waiting
patiently for the day of trial, discharged his
sureties, by a personal appearance in court. 
Yet this was not the only score he discharged
that morning; the solicitor presented his own
bill before they set out for Westminster-hall,
and gave the count to understand that it was
the custom, from time immemorial, for the
client to clear with his attorney before trial. 

Ferdinand had nothing to object against this established
rule, though he looked upon it as a
bad omen, in spite all the solicitor's confidence
and protestations; and he was not a little confounded,
when looking into the contents, he
found himself charged with 350 attendances. 
He knew it was not his interest to disoblige his
lawyer at such a juncture; neverthless, he
could not help expostulating with him on this
article, which seemed to be so falsly stated with
regard to the number, when his questions drew
on an explanation, by which he found he had
incurred the penalty of three shillings and four-pence
for every time he chanced to meet the
conscientious attorney either in the park, the
coffee-house, or the street, provided they had
exchanged the common salutation: and he
had great reason to believe the solicitor had
often thrown himself in his way, with a view
to swell this item of his account. 
With this extortion our adventurer was fain
to comply, because he lay at the mercy of the
caitiff; accordingly, he with a good grace
paid the demand, which, including his former
disbursements, amounted to three hundred
and fifty-five pounds eleven shillings three
pence three farthings, and then presenting himself
before the judge, quietly submited to the
laws of the realm. His council behaved like
men of consummate abilities in their profession; 
they exerted themselves with equal industry,
eloquence and erudition, in their endeavours
to perplex the truth, browbeat the evidence,
puzzle the judge, and mislead the jury: but
the defendant found himself woefully disappointed
in the deposition of Trapwell's journeyman, 

whom the solicitor pretended to have converted
to his interest: this witness, as the attorney afterwards
declared, played booty, and the facts came
out so clear, that Ferdinand Count Fathom was
convicted of criminal conversation with the
plaintiff's wife, and cast in fifteen hundred
pounds, under the denomination of damages. 
He was not so much surprized as afflicted at
this decision, because he saw it gradually approaching
from the examination of the first
evidence: his thoughts were now employed
in casting about for some method of deliverance,
from the snare in which he found himself
entangled. To escape he foresaw it would
be impracticable, as Trapwell would undoubtedly
be prepared for arresting him before he
could quit Westminster hall; he was too well
acquainted with Ratchkali's principles, to expect
any assistance from that quarter, in money-matters; 
and he was utterly averse to the payment
of the sum awarded against him, which
would have exhausted his whole fortune. He
therefore resolved to try the friendship of some
persons of fashon, with whom he had maintained
an intimacy of correspondence; should
they fail him in the day of his necessity,
he proposed to have recourse to his former sureties,
one of whom he meant to bilk, while
the other might accompany him in his retreat; 
or, should both these expedients miscarry, he
determined, rather than part with his effects, to
undergo the most disagreeable confinement, in
hope of obtaining the jailor's connivance at his
escape, 
These resolutions being taken, he met his
fate with great fortitude and equanimity, and 

calmly suffered himself to be conveyed to the
house of a sheriff's officer, who, as he made his
exit from the hall, according to his own expectation,
executed a writ against him, at the
suit of Trapwell, for a debt of two thousand
pounds. To this place he was followed by his
solicitor, who was allured by the prospect of another
job, and who, with great demonstrations
of satisfaction, congratulated him upon the
happy issue of the trail; arrogating to himself
the merit of having saved him eight thousand
pounds, in the article of damages, by the previous
steps he had taken, and the noble defence
that he and his friends the council had
made for their client: he even hinted an expectation
of receiving a gratuity for his extraordinary
care and discretion. 
Fathom, galled as he was with his misfortune,
and enraged at the effrontery of this pettifogger,
maintained a serenity of countenance,
and sent the attorney with a message to the
plaintiff, importing, that as he was a foreigner,
and could not be supposed to have so much
cash about him, as to spare fifteen hundred
pounds from the funds of his ordinary expence,
he would grant him a bond payable in two
months, during which period, he should be able
to procure a proper remittance from his own
estate. While the solicitor was employed in
this negociation, he dispatched his valet de
chambre to one nobleman, and Maurice to another,
with billets, signifying the nature of the
verdict which his adversary had obtained, and
desiring that each would lend him a thousand
pounds upon his parole, until he could negotiate
bills upon the continent. 

His three messengers returned almost at the
same instant of time, and these were the answers
they brought back. 
Trapwell absolutely rejected his personal security; 
and threatned him with all the horrors
of a goal, unless he would immediately discharge
the debt, or procure sufficient bondsmen; 
and one of his quality friends favoured
him with this reply to his request. 

“My dear Count!
I am mortally chagrin'd at the triumph
you have furnished to that rascally citizen. 
By the lard! the judge must have been in
the terrors of cuckoldom, to influence the
decision; and the jury, a meer herd of
horned beasts, to bring in such a barbarous
virdect. Egad! at this rate, no gentleman
will be able to lie with another man's wife,
but at the risk of a cursed prosecution. But,
to wave this disagreeable circumstance,
which you must strive to forget, I declare my
mortification is still the greater, because I
cannot at present supply you with the trifle
your present exigency requires; for, to tell
you a secret, my own finances are in damnable
confusion. But a man of count Fathom's
figure and address can never be puzzled
for the want of such a paultry sum. 
Adieu, my dear Count! we shall, I suppose,
have the pleasure of seeing you tomorrow
at White's: Mean while, I have the
honour to be, with the most perfect attachment, 
“Yours,
Grizzlegrin.” 

The other noble peer to whom he adressed
himself on this occasion, cherished the same sentiments
of virtue, friendship and generosity; 
but his expression was so different, that we
shall, for the edification of the reader, transcribe
his letter in his own words: 

“Sir,
I was never more astonished than at the
receipt of your very extraordinary billet,
wherein you solicit the loan of a thousand
pounds, which you desire may be sent with
the bearer on the faith of your parole. Sir,
I have no money to send you or lend you; 
and cannot help repeating my expressions of
surprize at your confidence in making such a
strange and unwarranted demand. 'Tis true,
I may have made professions of friendship,
while I looked upon you as a person of honour
and good morals; but now that you are
convicted of such a flagrant violation of the
laws of that kingdom where you have been
treated with such hospitality and respect, I
think myself fully absolved from any such
conditional promise, which indeed is never
interpreted into any other than a bare compliment. 
I am sorry you have involved your
character and fortune in such a disagreeable
affair, and am, 
“Sir, Yours, &c.
Trompington.” 
Ferdinand was not such a novice in the
world, as to be disappointed at these repulses; 

especially as he had laid very little stress upon
the application, which was made by way of an
experiment upon the gratitude or caprice of
those two noblemen, whom he had actually
more than once obliged with the same sort of
assistance which he now solicited, though not to
such a considerable amount. 
Having nothing further to expect from the
fashionable world, he sent the Tyroleze to the
person who had been bail for his appearance,
with full instructions to explain his present occasion
in the most favourable light, and desire
he would reinforce the credit of the count
with his security; but that gentleman, though
he placed the most perfect confidence in the
honour of our hero, and would have willingly
entered into bonds again for his personal appearance,
was not quite so well satisfied of his
circumstances, as to become liable for the payment
of two thousand pounds, an expence
which, in his opinion, the finances of no foreign
count were able to defray: he therefore
lent a deaf ear to the most pressing remonstrances
of the ambassador, who had recourse
to several other merchants, with the same bad
success: so that the prisoner, despairing of bail,
endeavoured to persuade Ratchkali, that it
would be his interest to contribute a thousand
pounds towards his discharge, that he might be
enabled to quit England with a good grace, and
execute his part of the plan they had projected. 
So powerful was his eloquence on the occasion,
and such strength of argument did he use,
that even the Tyroleze seemed convinced, tho'
reluctantly, and agreed to advance the necessary 

sum upon the bond and judgment of our adventurer,
who being disabled from transacting
his own affairs in person, was obliged to intrust
Ratchkali with his keys, papers, and power
of attorney, under the check and inspection of
his faithful Maurice and the solicitor, whose
fidelity he bespoke with the promise of an
ample recompence.
