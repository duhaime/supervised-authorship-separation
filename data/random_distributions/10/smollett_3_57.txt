Peregrine moralizes upon their behaviour, which is
condemned by the doctor, and defended by the governor. 
They arrive in safety at Lisle, dine at
an ordinary, visit the citadel. The physician
quarrels with a North-Briton, who is put in
arrest. 
These honourable adventurers being gone,
Peregrine, who was present during the
transaction, informed himself of the particulars
from the mouth of the inn-keeper himself, who
took God and the saints to witness, that he
should have been a loser by their custom, even if
the bill had been paid; because he was on his
guard against their objections, and had charged
every article at an under price: but such was
the authority of officers in France, that he durst
not dispute the least circumstance of their will; 
for had the case come under the cognizance of
the magistrate, he must in course have suffered
by the maxims of their government, which never
fail to abet the oppression of the army; and besides,
run the risque of incurring their future resentment,
which would be sufficient to ruin him
from top to bottom. 
Our hero boiled with indignation at this instance
of injustice and arbitrary power; and turning
to his governor, asked if this too was a proof
of the happiness enjoyed by the French people. 
Jolter replied, that every human constitution
must in some things be imperfect; and owned,
that in this kingdom gentlemen were more countenanced
than the vulgar, because it was to be presumed, 

that their own sentiments of honour and
superior qualifications, would entitle them to this
preheminence, which had also a retrospective
view to the merit of their ancestors, in consideration
of which they were at first ennobled: but
he affirmed, that the inn-keeper had misrepresented
the magistracy, which in France never
failed to punish flagrant outrages and abuse, without
respect of persons. 
The painter approved of the wisdom of the
French government, in bridling the insolence of
the mob, by which, he assured them, he had
often suffered in his own person; having been
often bespattered by hackney-coachmen, justled
by draymen and porters, and reviled in the most
opprobrious terms by the watermen of London,
where he had once lost his bag, and a considerable
quantity of hair, which had been cut off by
some rascal in his passage through Ludgate, during
the lord mayor's procession. On the other hand,
the doctor with great warmth alledged, that those
officers ought to suffer death, or banishment at
least, for having plundered the people in this
manner, which was so impudent and barefaced,
as plainly to prove they were certain of escaping
with impunity, and that they were old offenders
in the same degree of delinquency. He said,
that the greatest man in Athens would have been
condemned to perpetual exile, and seen his estate
confiscated for public use, had he dared in such
a licentious manner to violate the rights of a fellow-citizen:
and as for the little affronts to
which a man may be subject, from the petulance
of the multitude, he looked upon them as glorious
indications of liberty, which ought not to
be repressed, and would at any time rejoice to 

find himself overthrown in a kennel by the insolence
of a son of freedom, even though the fall
should cost him a limb: adding, by way of illustration,
that the greatest pleasure he ever enjoyed,
was in seeing a dustman wilfully overturn
a gentleman's coach, in which two ladies were
bruised, even to the danger of their lives. Pallet,
shocked at the extravagance of this declaration,
“If that be the case (said he) I wish you may
see every bone in your body broke, by the first
carman you meet in the streets of London.” 
This argument being discussed, and the reckoning
discharged without any deduction, although
the landlord, in stating the articles, had an eye
to the loss he had sustained by his own countrymen,
they departed form Arras, and arrived in
safety at Lisle, about two o'clock in the afternoon. 
They had scarce taken possession of their lodgings,
in a large hotel on the Grande Place, when
the inn-keeper gave them to understand, that
he kept an ordinary below, which was frequented
by several English gentlemen who resided in
town, and that dinner was then upon the table. 
Peregrine, who seized all opportunities of observing
new characters, persuaded his company
to dine in public; and they were accordingly
conducted to the place, where they found a
mixture of Scotch and Dutch officers, who
had come from Holland to learn their exercises
at the academy, and some gentlemen in the
French service, who were upon garison-duty in
the citadel. Among these last was a person about
the age of fifty, of a remarkably genteel air
and polite address, dignified with a Maltese cross,
and distinguished by the particular veneration
of all those who knew him. When he understood 

that Pickle and his friends were travellers,
he accosted the youth in English, which he spoke
tolerably well; and as they were strangers, offered
to attend them in the afternoon to all the
places worth seeing in Lisle. Our hero thanked
him for his excess of politeness, which (he said)
was peculiar to the French nation; and struck
with his engaging appearance, industriously courted
his conversation, in the course of which he
learnt, that this chevalier was a man of good
sense and great experience, that he was perfectly
well acquainted with the greatest part of Europe,
had lived some years in England, and was no
stranger to the constitution and genius of that
people. 
Having dined, and drank to the healths of the
English and French kings, two Fiacres were
called, in one of which the knight, with one of
his companions, the governor and Peregrine
seated themselves, the other being occupied by
the physician, Pallet, and two Scottish officers,
who proposed to accompany them in their circuit. 
The first place they visited was the citadel, round
the ramparts of which they walked, under the
conduct of the knight, who explained with great
accuracy the intention of every particular fortification
belonging to that seemingly impregnable
fortress; and when they had satisfied their curiosity,
took coach again, in order to view the
arsenal, which stands in another quarter of the
town: but, just as Pickle's carriage had crossed
the Promenade, he heard his own name bawled
aloud by the painter; and ordering the Fiacre to
stop, saw Pallet with one half of his body thrust
out at the window of the other coach, crying
with a terrified look, “Mr. Pickle, Mr. Pickle, 

for the love of God! halt, and prevent bloodshed,
else here will be carnage and cutting of
throats.” Peregrine, surprized at this exclamation,
immediately alighted, and advancing to
the other vehicle, found one of their military
companions standing upon the ground, at the further
side of the coach, with his sword drawn,
and fury in his countenance; and the physician,
with a quivering lip and haggard aspect, struggling
with the other, who had interposed in the quarrel,
and detained him in his place. 
Our young gentleman, upon inquiry, found
that this animosity had sprung from a dispute that
happened upon the ramparts, touching the strength
of the fortification, which the doctor, according
to custom, undervalued, because it was a modern
work; saying, that by the help of the military
engines used among the ancients, and a
few thousands of pioneers, he would engage to
take it in less than ten days after he should sit
down before it. The North-Briton, who was
as great a pedant as the physician, having studied
fortification, and made himself master of Cæsar's
Commentaries and Polybius, with the observations
of Folard, affirmed, that all the methods
of besieging practised by the ancients, would be
utterly ineffectual against such a plan as that of
the citadel of Lisle; and began to compare the
Vineæ, Aggeres, Arietes, Scorpiones and Catapultæ 
of the Romans, with the trenches, mines,
batteries and mortars used in the present art of
war. The republican, finding himself attacked
upon what he thought his strong side, summoned
all his learning to his aid; and describing the famous
siege of Platæa, happened to misquote a
passage of Thucydides, in which he was corrected 

by the other, who having been educated
for the church, was also a connoisseur in the
Greek language. The doctor, incensed at being
detected in such a blunder, in presence of Pallet,
who (he knew) would promulgate his shame,
told the officer, with great arrogance, that his
objection was frivolous, and that he must not
pretend to dispute on these matters with one who
had considered them with the utmost accuracy
and care. His antagonist, piqued at this supercilious
insinuation, replied with great heat, that
for ought he knew, the doctor might be a very
expert apothecary, but that in the art of war,
and knowledge in the Greek tongue, he was no
other than an ignorant pretender. This asseveration
produced an answer full of virulence, including
a national reflection upon the soldier's
country; and the contention rose to mutual
abuse, when it was suppressed by the admonitions
of the other two, who begged they would
not expose themselves in a strange place, but behave
themselves like fellow-subjects and friends. 
They accordingly ceased reviling each other, and
the affair was seemingly forgot; but, after they
had resumed their places in the coach, the painter
unfortunately asked the meaning of the
word Tortoise, which he had heard them mention
among the Roman implements of war. 
This question was answered by the physician,
who described the nature of this expedient so
little to the satisfaction of the officer, that he
contradicted him flatly, in the midst of his explanation; 
a circumstance which provoked the republican
to such a degree, that in the temerity
of his passion, he uttered the epithet impertinent
scoundrel; which was no sooner pronounced 

than the Caledonian made manual application
to his nose, and leaping out of the coach, stood
waiting for him on the plain; while he (the
physician) made feeble efforts to join him,
being easily retained by the other soldier; and
Pallet, dreading the consequence in which he himself
might be involved, bellowed aloud for prevention. 
Our hero endeavoured to quiet the commotion,
by representing to the Scot, that he had
already taken satisfaction for the injury he had
received; and telling the doctor, that he had deserved
the chastisement which was inflicted upon
him: but the officer (encouraged perhaps by the
confusion of his antagonist) insisted upon his asking
pardon for what he had said; and the doctor,
believing himself under the protection of his friend
Pickle, far from agreeing to such concession,
breathed nothing but defiance and revenge: so
that the chevalier, in order to prevent mischief,
put the soldier under arrest, and sent him to his
lodgings, under the care of the other French
gentleman and his own companion; they being
also accompanied by Mr. Jolter, who having
formerly seen all the curiosities of Lisle, willingly
surrendered his place to the physician.
