It must needs be a hostile kind
of a world, when the buyer (if
it be but of a sorry post-chaise) cannot
go forth with the seller thereof
into the street to terminate the
difference betwixt them, but he instantly
falls into the same frame of
mind and views his conventionist
with the same sort of eye, as if he
was going along with him to Hyde-park
corner to fight a duel. For my
own part, being but a poor sword'sman,
and no way a match for Monsieur
Dessein, I felt the rotation of 

all the movements within me, to
which the situation is incident —I
looked at Monsieur Dessein through
and through—ey'd him as he walked
along in profile—then, en face— 
thought he look'd like a Jew— 
then a Turk—disliked his wig— 
cursed him by my gods—wished
him at the devil— 
—And is all this to be lighted
up in the heart for a beggarly account
of three or four louisd'ors,
which is the most I can be overreach'd
in? —Base passion! said I,
turning myself about, as a man naturally
does upon a sudden reverse of
sentiment—base, ungentle passion!
thy hand is against every man, and 

every man's hand against thee— 
heaven forbid! said she, raising her
hand up to her forehead, for I had
turned full in front upon the lady
whom I had seen in conference with
the monk—she had followed us unperceived 
—Heaven forbid indeed!
said I, offering her my own—she
had a black pair of silk gloves open
only at the thumb and two fore-fingers,
so accepted it without reserve
—and I led her up to the door
of the Remise. 
Monsieur Dessein had diabled the
key above fifty times before he found
out he had come with a wrong one
in his hand: we were as impatient as
himself to have it open'd; and so 

attentive to the obstacle, that I continued
holding her hand almost without
knowing it; so that Monsieur
Dessein left us together with her hand
in mine, and with our faces turned
towards the door of the Remise, and
said he would be back in five minutes. 
Now a colloquy of five minutes,
in such a situation, is worth
one of as many ages, with your
faces turned towards the street:
in the latter case, 'tis drawn from
the objects and occurrences without
—when your eyes are fixed upon
a dead blank—you draw purely from
yourselves. A silence of a single
moment upon Monsieur Dessein's 

leaving us, had been fatal to the
situation—she had infallibly turned
about—so I begun the conversation
instantly.— 
—But what were the temptations,
(as I write not to apologize for the
weaknesses of my heart in this tour,
—but to give an account of them)— 
shall be described with the same
simplicity, with which I felt them.
