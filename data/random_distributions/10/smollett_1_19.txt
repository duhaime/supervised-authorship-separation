Our hero departs from Vienna, and quits the domain
of Venus for the rough field of Mars. 
Luckily for our adventurer, before he adhered
to this determination, the young
count de Melvile was summoned to Presburg
by his father, who desired to see him, before
he should take the field, in consequence of a
rupture between the emperor and the French
king: and Fathom of course quitted Vienna, 

in order to attend his patron, after he and Renaldo
had resided two whole years in that capital,
where the former had made himself perfect
in all the polite exercises, become master of the
French tongue, and learned to speak the Italian
with great facility; over and above those other
accomplishments in which we have represented
him as an inimitable original. 
As for the young count, his exteriors were
so much improved by the company to which
he had access, since his departure from his father's
house, that his parents were equally surprised
and overjoyed at the alteration. All
that aukwardness and rusticity, which hung
upon his deportment, was, like the rough
coat of a diamond, polished away; the connection
and disposition of his limbs seemed to have
been adjusted anew; his carriage was become
easy, his air perfectly genteel, and his conversation
gay and unrestrained. The merit of
this reformation was in a great measure ascribed
to the care and example of Mr Fathom,
who was received by the old count and his
lady with marks of singular friendship and
esteem; nor was he overlooked by Mademoiselle,
who still remained in a state of celibacy.
and seemed to have resigned all hope of altering
her condition; she expressed uncommon
satisfaction at the return of her old favourite,
and re-admitted him into the same degree of
familiarity with which he had been honoured
before his departure. 
The joy of Teresa was so excessive at his arrival,
that she could scarce suppress her raptures,
so as to conceal them from the notice of
the family; and our hero, upon this occasion, 

performed the part of an exquisite actor, in
dissembling those transports which his bosom
never knew. So well had this pupil retained
the lessons of her instructor, that, in the midst
of those fraudulent appropriations, which she
still continued to make, she had found means
to support her interest and character with Mademoiselle,
and even to acquire such influence
in the family, that no other servant, male or
female, could pretend to live under the same
roof, without paying incessant homage to this
artful waiting woman, and yielding the most
abject submission to her will. 
The young gentlemen having tarried at Presburg
about six weeks, during which a small
field equipage was prepared for Renaldo, they
repaired to the camp at Heilbron, under the
auspices of count Melvile, in whose regiment
they carried arms, as volunteers, with a view
to merit promotion in the service, by their own
personal behaviour. Our adventurer would
have willingly dispensed with this occasion of
signalizing himself, his talents being much better
adapted to another sphere of life; nevertheless,
he affected uncommon alacrity at the
prospect of gathering laurels in the field, and
subscribed to his fortune with a good grace; 
foreseeing that, even in a campaigne, a man of
his art and ingenuity might find means to
consult his corporal safety, without any danger
to his reputation. Accordingly, before he had
lived full three weeks in camp, the damp situation
and sudden change in his way of life,
had such a violent effect upon his constitution,
that he was deprived of the use of all his limbs,
and mourned without ceasing, his hard fate, 

by which he found himself precluded from all
opportunity of exerting his dilligence, courage
and activity, in the character of a soldier, to
which he now aspired. 
Renaldo, who was actually enamoured of a
martial life, and missed no occasion of distinguishing
himself, consoled his companion, with
great cordiality, encouraged him with the hope
of seeing his constitution familiarized to the inconveniencies
of a camp, and accommodated
him with every thing which he thought would
alleviate the pain of his body, as well as the
anxiety of his mind. The old count, who sincerely
sympathized with his affliction, would
have persuaded him to retire into quarters,
where he could be carefully nursed, and provided
with every thing necessary to a person
in his condition; but, such was his desire of
glory, that he resisted his patron's importunities,
with great constancy, till at length, seeing
the old gentleman obstinately determined to consult
his health, by removing him from the field,
he gradually suffered himself to recover the use
of his hands, made shift to sit up in his bed, and
amuse himself with cards or back gammon,
and notwithstanding the feeble condition of
his legs, ventured to ride out on horseback, to
visite the lines; though the count and his son
would never yield to his solicitations so far, as
to let him accompany Renaldo in those excursions
and reconnoitring parties by which a volunteer
inures himself to toil and peril, and
acquires that knowledge in the operations of
war, which qualifies him for a command in
the service. 
Notwithstanding this exemption from all 

duty, our adventurer managed matters so as
to pass for a youth of infinite mettle, and even
rendered his backwardness and timidity subservient
to the support of that character, by
expressing an impatience of lying inactive, and
a desire of signalizing his prowess, which even
the disabled condition of his body could scarce
restrain. He must be a man of very weak
nerves and excessive irresolution, who can live
in the midst of actual service, without imbibing
some portion of military fortitude; danger
becomes habitual, and loses a great part of
its terror; and as fear is often caught by contagion,
so is courage communicated among the
individuals of an army. The hope of fame,
desire of honours and preferment, envy, emulation,
and the dread of disgrace, are motives
which co-operate in suppressing that aversion
to death or mutilation, which nature hath implanted
in the human mind; and therefore, it
is not to be wondered at, if Fathom, who
was naturally chicken-hearted, gained some advantages
over his disposition, before the end of
the campaign, which happened to be neither
perilous nor severe. 
During the winter, while both armies remained
in quarters, our adventurer attended
his patron to Presburgh, and before the troops
were in motion, Renaldo obtained a commission,
in consequence of which he went into
garrison at Philipsburg, whither he was followed
by our hero, while the old count's duty called
him to the field in a different place. Ferdinand,
for some time had no reason to be dissatisfied
with this disposition, by which he was
at once delivered from the fatigues of a campaign, 

and the inspection of a severe censor,
in the person of count Melvile; and his satisfaction
was still increased by an accidental
meeting with the Tyrolese, who had been his
confederate at Vienna, and now chanced to
serve in garrison, on the same footing with
himself. These two knights-errant renewed
their former correspondence, and as all soldiers
are addicted to gaming, levied contributions
upon all those officers who had money to
lose, and temerity to play. 
However they had not long pursued this
branch of traffic, when their success was interrupted
by a very serious occurrence, that
for the present intirely detached the gentlemen
in the garrison from such amusements. 
The French troops invested Fort Kehl, situated
on the Rhine, opposite to Strasburg, and
the Imperialists, dreading that the next storm
would fall upon Philipsburgh, employed
themselves with great diligence, to put that
important fortress in a proper posture of defence. 
If the suspension of play was displeasing
to our hero, the expectation of being besieged
was by no means more agreeable. He
knew the excellence of the French engineers,
the power of their artillery, and the perseverance
of their general: she felt, by anticipation,
the toils of hard duty upon the works,
the horrors of night alarms, cannonading,
bombardment, sallies and mines blown up; 
and deliberated with himself, whether or not
he should privately withdraw, and take refuge
among the besiegers; but, when he reflected
that such a step, besides the infamy that must
attend it, would be like that of running upon 

Scylla, seeking to avoid Charybdis, as he would
be exposed to more danger and inconvenience
in the trenches, than he could possibly undergo
in the town, and after all run the risque of
being taken and treated as a deserter; upon
these considerations, he resolved to submit
himself to his destiny, and endeavoured to mitigate
the rigour of his fate, by those arts he
had formerly practised with success. He accordingly
found means to enjoy a very bad
state of health during the whole siege, which
lasted about six weeks after the trenches were
opened; and then the garrison marched out
by capitulation, with all the honours of war.
