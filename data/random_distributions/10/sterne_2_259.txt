—But softly—for in these
sportive plains, and under
this genial sun, where at this instant all
flesh is running out piping, fiddling, and
dancing to the vintage, and every step
that's taken, the judgment is surprised by
the imagination, I defy, notwithstanding 

all that has been said upon straight lines* 
in sundry pages of my book—I defy the
best cabbage planter that ever existed,
whether he plants backwards or forwards,
it makes little difference in the account
(except that he will have more to answer
for in the one case than in the other)— 
I defy him to go on cooly, critically, and
canonically, planting his cabbages one by
one, in straight lines, and stoical distances,
especially if slits in petticoats are unsew'd
up—without ever and anon straddling
out, or sidling into some bastardly
digression—In Freeze-land, Fog-land
and some other lands I wot of—it may
be done—. 
But in this clear climate of fantasy
and perspiration, where every idea, 

sensible and insensible, gets vent—in
this land, my dear Eugenius—in this
fertile land of chivalry and romance,
where I now sit, unskrewing my ink-horn
to write my uncle Toby's amours, and
with all the meanders of Julia's track
in quest of her Diego, in full view of
my study window—if thou comest not
and takest me by the hand— 
What a work is it likely to turn
out! 
Let us begin it.
