Miss Arabella Harlowe, To Miss Howe. 

Thursday, July 20. 
Miss Howe,
I have yours of this morning. All that has happened
to the unhappy body you mention, is what we foretold,
and expected. Let him, for whose sake she abandoned
us, be her comfort. We are told he has remorse,
and would marry her. We don't believe it, indeed. She
may be very ill. Her disappointment may make her so,
or ought. Yet is she the only one I know, who is disappointed. 
I cannot say, Miss, that the notification from you is
the more welcome for the liberties you have been pleased
to take with our whole family, for resenting a conduct,
that it is a shame any young lady should justify. Excuse
this freedom, occasioned by greater. 
I am, Miss, Your humble Servant,
Arabella Harlowe.
