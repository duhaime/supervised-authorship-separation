Mr. Lovelace, To John Belford, Esq; 

Tired with a succession of fatiguing days and sleepless
nights, and with contemplating the precarious
situation I stand in with my Beloved, I fell into
a profound resverie; which brought on sleep; and
that produced a dream; a fortunate dream; which,
as I imagine, will afford my working mind the means
to effect the obliging double purpose my heart is now
once more set upon. 
What, as I have often contemplated, is the enjoyment
of the finest woman in the world, to the contrivance,
the bustle, the surprizes, and at last the
happy conclusion of a well-laid plot? —The charming
roundabouts, to come the nearest way home;— 

the doubts; the apprehensions; the heart-akings, the
meditated triumphs. —These are the joys that make
the blessing dear. —For all the rest, what is it? — 
What but to find an angel in imagination dwindled
down to a woman in fact? —But to my dream— 
Methought it was about nine on Wednesday morning,
that a chariot, with a dowager's arms upon the
doors, and in it a grave matronly lady [not unlike
Mother H. in the face; but in her heart O how unlike!],
stopp'd at a grocer's shop, about ten doors
on the other side of the way, in order to buy some
groceries: And methought Dorcas, having been out
to see if the coast were clear for her lady's flight, and
if a coach were to be got near the place, espied this
chariot with the dowager's arms, and this matronly
lady: And what, methought, did Dorcas, that subtle
traitress, do, but whip up to the old matronly
lady, and, lifting up her voice, say, Good my Lady,
permit me one word with your Ladyship. 
What thou hast to say to me, say on, quoth the
old lady; the grocer retiring, and standing aloof, to
give Dorcas leave to speak; who, methought, in
words like these, accosted the lady. 
‘You seem, Madam, to be a very good lady; 
and here in this neighbourhood, at a house of no
high repute, is an innocent lady of rank and fortune,
beautiful as a May morning, and youthful
as a rose-bud, and full as sweet and lovely; 
who has been trick'd thither by a wicked gentleman,
practised in the ways of the town; and this
very night will she be ruined, if she get not out
of his hands. Now, O Lady! if you will extend
your compassionate goodness to this fair young lady,
in whom, the moment you behold her, you will
see cause to believe all I say; and let her but have
a place in your chariot, and remain in your protection
for one day only, till she can send a man 

and a horse to her rich and powerful friends; you
may save from ruin a lady, who has no equal for
virtue as well as beauty.’ 
Methought the old lady, moved with Dorcas's
story, answered and said, ‘Hasten, O damsel, who
in a happy moment art come to put it in my power
to serve the innocent and the virtuous, which it
has always been my delight to do: Hasten to this
young lady, and bid her hie hither to me with all
speed; and tell her, that my chariot shall be her
asylum: And if I find all that thou sayest true, my
house shall be her sanctuary, and I will protect
her from all her oppressors.’ 
Hereupon, methought, this traitress Dorcas hied
back to the lady, and made report of what she had
done. And, methought, the lady highly approved
of Dorcas's proceeding, and blessed her for her good
thought. 
And I lifted up mine eyes, and behold the lady
issued out of the house, and without looking back,
ran to the chariot with the dowager's coat upon it,
and was received by the matronly lady with open
arms, and ‘Welcome, welcome, welcome, fair
young lady, who so well answer the description of
the faithful damsel: And I will carry you instantly
to my house, where you shall meet with all the
good usage your heart can wish for, till you can
apprise your rich and powerful friends of your past
dangers, and present escape.’ 
‘Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you,
worthy, thrice worthy lady, who afford so kindly
your protection to a most unhappy young creature,
who has been basely seduced and betrayed, and
brought to the very brink of destruction.’ 
Methought then, the matronly lady, who had by
the time the young lady came to her, bought and
paid for the goods she wanted, ordered her coachman
to drive home with all speed; who stopped not 

till he had arrived in a certain street, not far from
Lincolns-inn-fields, where the matronly lady lived
in a sumptuous dwelling, replete with damsels who
wrought curiously in muslins, cambricks, and fine
linen, and in every good work that industrious damsels
love to be imployed about, except the loom and
the spinning-wheel. 
And methought, all the way the young lady and
the old lady rode, and after they came in, till dinner
was ready, the young lady filled up the time with the
dismal account of her wrongs and her sufferings, the
like of which was never heard by mortal ear; and
this in so moving a manner, that the good old lady
did nothing but weep, and sigh, and sob, and inveigh
against the arts of wicked men, and against that
abominable 'Squire Lovelace, who was a plotting villain,
methought she said; and, more than that, an
unchained Beelzebub. 
Methought I was in a dreadful agony, when I
found the lady had escaped; and in my wrath had
like to have slain Dorcas, and our mother, and every
one I met. But, by some quick transition, and strange
metamorphosis, which dreams do not usually account
for, methought, all of a sudden, this matronly lady
was turned into the famous Mother H. herself; and,
being an old acquaintance of Mother Sinclair, was
prevailed upon to assist in my plot upon the young
lady. 
Then, methought, followed a strange scene; for,
Mother H. longing to hear more of the young lady's
story, and night being come, besought her to accept
of a place in her own bed, in order to have all the
talk to themselves. For, methought, two young
nieces of hers had broken in upon them in the middle
of the dismal tale. 
Accordingly going early to bed, and the sad story
being resumed, with as great earnestness on one side,
as attention on the other, before the young lady had 

gone far in it, Mother H. methought was taken with
a fit of the colic; and her tortures increasing, was
obliged to rise, to get a cordial she used to find specific
in this disorder, to which she was unhappily
subject. 
Having thus risen, and stept to her closet, methought
she let fall the wax taper in her return,
and then [O metamorphosis still stranger than the
former! What unaccountable things are dreams!],
coming to bed again in the dark, the young lady,
to her infinite astonishment, grief, and surprize,
found Mother H. turned into a young person of the
other sex: And altho' Lovelace was the abhorred of
her soul, yet, fearing it was some other person, it
was matter of some consolation to her, when she
found it was no other than himself, and that she had
been still the bedfellow of but one and the same man. 
A strange promiscuous huddle of adventures followed; 
scenes perpetually shifting; now nothing
heard from the lady, but sighs, groans, exclamations,
faintings, dyings. —From the gentleman, but vows,
promises, protestations, disclaimers of purposes pursued; 
and all the gentle and ungentle pressures of the
lover's warfare. 
Then, as quick as thought [for dreams, thou
knowest, confine not themselves to the rules of the
drama], ensued recoveries, lyings-in, christenings,
the smiling boy, amply, even in her own opinion,
rewarding the suffering mother. 
Then the grandfather's estate yielded up, possession
taken of it—Living very happily upon it: — 
Her beloved Norton her companion; Miss Howe
her visitor; and (admirable! thrice admirable!) enabled
to compare notes with her; a charming girl, by
the same father, to her friend's charming boy; who,
as they grow up, in order to consolidate their mammas
friendships [for neither have dreams regard to
consanguinity], intermarry; change names by act of 

parliament, to enjoy my estate;—and I know not
what of the like incongruous stuff. 
I awoke, as thou mayest believe, in great disorder,
and rejoiced to find my charmer in the next room,
and Dorcas honest. 
Now thou wilt say, this was a very odd dream. 
And yet (for I am a strange dreamer) it is not altogether
improbable, that something like it may happen; 
as the pretty simpleton has the weakness to
confide in Dorcas, whom, till now, she disliked. 
But I forgot to tell thee one part of my dream; 
and that was, That, the next morning, the lady gave
way to such transports of grief and resentment, that
she was with difficulty diverted from making an attempt
upon her own life. But, however, at last,
was prevailed upon to resolve to live, and to make
the best of the matter. A letter, methought, from
Capt. Tomlinson helping to pacify her, written to
apprise me, that her uncle Harlowe would certainly
be at Kentish-town on Wednesday night June 28.
the following day, the 29th, being his anniversary
birth-day; and he doubly desirous, on that account,
that our nuptials should be then privately solemnized
in his presence. 
But is Thursday the 29th her uncle's anniversary,
methinks thou askest? —It is; or else the day of celebration
should have been earlier still. Three weeks
ago I heard her say it was; and I have down the
birth-day of every one of her family, and the wedding-day
of her father and mother. The minutest
circumstances are often of great service, in matters
of the last importance. 
And what sayest thou now to my dream? 
Who says, that, sleeping and waking, I have not
fine helps from some body, some spirit rather, as
thou'lt be apt to say? —But no wonder that a Beelzebub
has his devilkins to attend his call. 
I can have no manner of doubt of succeeding in 

Mother H.'s part of the scheme; for will the lady
(who resolves to throw herself into the first house she
can enter, or to bespeak the protection of the first
person she meets; and who thinks there can be no danger
out of this house, equal to what she apprehends from
Me in it) scruple to accept of the chariot of a dowager,
accidentally offering? And the lady's protection
engaged by her faithful Dorcas, so highly bribed to
promote her escape? —And then Mrs. H. has the air
and appearance of a venerable matron, and is not
such a forbidding devil as Mrs. Sinclair. 
The pretty simpleton knows nothing of the world; 
nor that people who have money never want assistants
in their views, be they what they will. How
else could the princes of the earth be so implicitly
served as they are, change they hands ever so often,
and be their purposes ever so wicked? 
If I can but get her to go on with me till Wednesday
next week, we shall be settled together pretty
quietly by that time. And indeed if she has any gratitude,
and has in her the least of her sex's foibles,
she must think I deserve her favour, by the pains
she has cost me. For dearly do they all love, that
men should take pains about them, and for them. 
And here, for the present, I will lay down my
pen, and congratulate myself upon my happy invention
(since her obstinacy puts me once more upon exercising
it)—But with this resolution, I think, That,
if the present contrivance fail me, I will exert all
the faculties of my mind, all my talents, to procure
for myself a legal right to her favour, and that in
defiance of all my antipathies to the married state; 
and of the suggestions of the great devil out of the
house, and of his secret agents in it. —Since, if now
she is not to be prevailed upon, or drawn in, it will
be in vain to attempt her further.
