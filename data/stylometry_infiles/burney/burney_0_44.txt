Mr. Villars to Evelina. 
Berry Hill, May 28. 
With a reluctance which occasions
me inexpressible uneasiness, I have
been almost compelled to consent that my
Evelina should quit the protection of the
hospitable and respectable Lady Howard,
and accompany Madame Duval to a city
to which I had hoped she had bid an eternal
adieu. But alas, my dear child, we are the
slaves of custom, the dupes of prejudice,
and dare not stem the torrent of an opposing
world, even though our judgments condemn
our compliance! however, since the
die is cast, we must endeavour to make the
best of it. 
You will have occasion, in the course of
the month you are to pass with Madame
Duval, for all the circumspection and prudence
you can call to your aid: she will 
not, I know, propose any thing to you
which she thinks wrong herself; but you
must learn not only to judge but to act for
yourself: if any schemes are started, any
engagements made, which your understanding
represents to you as improper, exert
yourself resolutely in avoiding them, and do
not, by a too passive facility, risk the censure
of the world, or your own future regret. 
You cannot too assiduously attend to
Madame Duval herself; but I would wish
you to mix as little as possible with her associates,
who are not likely to be among
those whose acquaintance would reflect credit
upon you. Remember, my dear Evelina,
nothing is so delicate as the reputation
of a woman: it is, at once, the most
beautiful and most brittle of all human
things. 
Adieu, my beloved child; I shall be
but ill at ease till this month is elapsed. 
A. V.
