The following Moral Romance
(or whatever Title the Reader
shall please to give it) is the Work of
a Woman, and her first Essay; which,
to the good-natured and candid Reader
will, it is hoped, be a sufficient Apology
for the many Inaccuracies he will
find in the Style, and other Faults of
the Composition. 
PERHAPS the best Excuse
that can be made for a Woman's venturing 

to write at all, is that which
really produced this Book; Distress in
her Circumstances: which she could not
so well remove by any other Means in
her Power. 
IF it should meet with Success, it
will be the only Good Fortune she ever
has known; but as she is very sensible,
That must chiefly depend upon the Entertainment
the World will find in the
Book itself, and not upon what she can
say in the Preface, either to move their
Compassion, or bespeak their Good-will,
she will detain them from it no longer.
