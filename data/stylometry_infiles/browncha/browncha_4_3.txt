The
flattering reception that has
been given, by the public, to Arthur
Mervyn,
has
prompted the writer to solicit a
continuance of the same favour, and to
offer to the world a new performance.
America has opened new views to the
naturalist and politician, but has seldome
furnished themes to the moral painter.
That new springs of action, and new
motives to curiosity should operate; that
the field of investigation, opened to us by
our own country, should differ essentially
from those which exist in Europe, may be
readily conceived. The sources of amusement
to the fancy and instruction to the
heart, that are peculiar to ourselves, are
equally numerous and inexhaustible. It is
the purpose of this work to profit by some




of these sources; to exhibit a series of
adventures, growing out of the condition
of our country, and connected with one of
the most common and most wonderful diseases
or affections of the human frame.
One merit the writer may at least
claim; that of calling forth the passions
and engaging the sympathy of the reader,
by means hitherto unemployed by preceding
authors. Peurile superstition and exploded
manners; Gothic castles and chimeras, are
the materials usually employed for this
end. The incidents of Indian hostility,
and the perils of the western wilderness,
are far more suitable; and, for a native of
America to overlook these, would admit
of no apology. These, therefore, are, in
part, the ingredients of this tale, and these
he has been ambitious of depicting in vivid
and faithful colours. The success of his
efforts must be estimated by the liberal and
candid reader.
