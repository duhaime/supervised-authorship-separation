I now come to the mention of a per&longs;on with
who&longs;e name the mo&longs;t turbulent &longs;en&longs;ations are connected.
It is with a &longs;huddering reluctance that I
enter on the province of de&longs;cribing him. Now it
is that I begin to perceive the difficulty of the ta&longs;k
which I have undertaken; but it would be weakne&longs;s
to &longs;hrink from it. My blood is congealed: and
my fingers are pal&longs;ied when I call up his image.
Shame upon my cowardly and infirm heart! Hitherto
I have proceeded with &longs;ome degree of composure,
but now I mu&longs;t pau&longs;e. I mean not that
dire remembrance &longs;hall &longs;ubdue my courage or baffle
my de&longs;ign, but this weakne&longs;s cannot be immediately
conquered. I mu&longs;t de&longs;i&longs;t for a little while.
I have taken a few turns in my chamber, and
have gathered &longs;trength enough to proceed. Yet
have I not projected a ta&longs;k beyond my power to
execute? If thus, on the very thre&longs;hold of the
&longs;cene, my knees faulter and I &longs;ink, how &longs;hall I support
my&longs;elf, when I ru&longs;h into the mid&longs;t of horrors
&longs;uch as no heart has hitherto conceived, nor tongue
related? I &longs;icken and recoil at the pro&longs;pect, and yet
my irre&longs;olution is momentary. I have not formed
this de&longs;ign upon &longs;light grounds, and though I may at
times pau&longs;e and he&longs;itate, I will not be finally
diverted from it.
And thou, O mo&longs;t fatal and potent of mankind,
in what terms &longs;hall I de&longs;cribe thee? What words
are adequate to the ju&longs;t delineation of thy character?
How &longs;hall I detail the means which rendered




the &longs;ecrecy of thy purpo&longs;es unfathomable? But
I will not anticipate. Let me recover if po&longs;&longs;ible,
a &longs;ober &longs;train. Let me keep down the flood of
pa&longs;&longs;ion that would render me precipitate or powerless.
Let me &longs;tifle the agonies that are awakened
by thy name. Let me, for a time, regard thee as a
being of no terrible attributes. Let me tear my&longs;elf
from contemplation of the evils of which it is but
too certain that thou wa&longs;t the author, and limit my
view to tho&longs;e harmle&longs;s appearances which attended
thy entrance on the &longs;tage.
One &longs;unny afternoon, I was &longs;tanding in the door
of my hou&longs;e, when I marked a per&longs;on pa&longs;&longs;ing clo&longs;e
to the edge of the bank that was in front. His
pace was a carele&longs;s and lingering one, and had
none of that gracefulne&longs;s and ea&longs;e which distinguish
a per&longs;on with certain advantages of education
from a clown. His gait was ru&longs;tic and
aukward. His form was ungainly and disproportioned.
Shoulders broad and &longs;quare, brea&longs;t &longs;unken,
his head drooping, his body of uniform breadth,
&longs;upported by long and lank legs, were the ingredients
of his frame. His garb was not ill adapted
to &longs;uch a figure. A &longs;louched hat, tarni&longs;hed by the
weather, a coat of thick grey cloth, cut and
wrought, as it &longs;eemed, by a country tailor, blue
wor&longs;ted &longs;tockings, and &longs;hoes fa&longs;tened by thongs,
and deeply di&longs;coloured by du&longs;t, which bru&longs;h had
never di&longs;turbed, con&longs;tituted his dre&longs;s.
There was nothing remarkable in the&longs;e appearances;
they were frequently to be met with on the
road, and in the harve&longs;t field. I cannot tell why
I gazed upon them, on this occa&longs;ion, with more
than ordinary attention, unle&longs;s it were that &longs;uch
figures were &longs;eldom &longs;teen by me, except on the road
or field. This lawn was only traver&longs;ed by men




who&longs;e views were directed to the plea&longs;ures of the
walk, or the grandeur of the &longs;cenery.
He pa&longs;&longs;ed &longs;lowly along, frequently pau&longs;ing, as
if to examine the pro&longs;pect more deliberately, but
never turning his eye towards the hou&longs;e, &longs;o as to
allow me a view of his countenance. Pre&longs;ently,
he entered a cop&longs;e at a &longs;mall di&longs;tance, and disappeared.
My eye followed him while he remained
in &longs;ight. If his image remained for any duration
in my fancy after his departure, it was becau&longs;e no
other object occurred &longs;ufficient to expel it.
I continued in the &longs;ame &longs;pot for half an hour,
vaguely, and by fits, contemplating the image of this
wanderer, and drawing, from outward appearances,
tho&longs;e inferences with re&longs;pect to the intellectual
hi&longs;tory of this per&longs;on, which experience affords us.
I reflected on the alliance which commonly &longs;ub&longs;i&longs;ts
between ignorance and the practice of agriculture,
and indulged my&longs;elf in airy &longs;peculations as to the
influence of progre&longs;&longs;ive knowledge in di&longs;&longs;olving
this alliance, and embodying the dreams of the
poets. I a&longs;ked why the plough and the hoe might
not become the trade of every human being, and
how this trade might be made conducive to, or, at
lea&longs;t, con&longs;i&longs;tent with the acqui&longs;ition of wi&longs;dom
and eloquence.
Weary with the&longs;e reflections, I returned to the
kitchen to perform &longs;ome hou&longs;ehold office. I had
u&longs;ually but one &longs;ervant, and &longs;he was a girl about
my own age. I was bu&longs;y near the chimney, and
&longs;he was employed near the door of the apartment,
when &longs;ome one knocked. The door was opened
by her, and &longs;he was immediately addre&longs;&longs;ed with
“Pry'thee, good girl, can&longs;t thou &longs;upply a thir&longs;ty
man with a gla&longs;s of buttermilk?” She an&longs;wered
that there was none in the hou&longs;e. “Aye, but




there is &longs;ome in the dairy yonder. Thou knowe&longs;t
as well as I, though Hermes never taught thee, that
though every dairy be an hou&longs;e, every hou&longs;e is not
a dairy.” To this &longs;peech, though &longs;he under&longs;tood
only a part of it, &longs;he replied by repeating her assurances,
that &longs;he had none to give. “Well then,”
rejoined the &longs;tranger, “for charity's &longs;weet &longs;ake, hand
me forth a cup of cold water.” The girl &longs;aid &longs;he
would go to the &longs;pring and fetch it. “Nay, give
me the cup, and &longs;uffer me to help my&longs;elf. Neither
manacled nor lame, I &longs;hould merit burial in the
maw of carrion crows, if I laid this ta&longs;k upon
thee.” She gave him the cup, and he turned to
go to the &longs;pring.
I li&longs;tened to this dialogue in &longs;ilence. The words
uttered by the per&longs;on without, affected me as somewhat
&longs;ingular, but what chiefly rendered them remarkable,
was the tone that accompanied them. It
was wholly new. My brother's voice and Pleyel's
were mu&longs;ical and energetic. I had fondly imagined,
that, in this re&longs;pect, they were &longs;urpa&longs;&longs;ed by
none. Now my mi&longs;take was detected. I cannot
pretend to communicate the impre&longs;&longs;ion that was
made upon me by the&longs;e accents, or to depict the
degree in which force and &longs;weetne&longs;s were blended
in them. They were articulated with a distinctness
that was unexampled in my experience. But
this was not all. The voice was not only mellifluent
and clear, but the empha&longs;is was &longs;o ju&longs;t, and
the modulation &longs;o impa&longs;&longs;ioned, that it &longs;eemed as if
an heart of &longs;tone could not fail of being moved by
it. It imparted to me an emotion altogether involuntary
and incontroulable. When he uttered
the words “for charity's &longs;weet &longs;ake,” I dropped the
cloth that I held in my hand, my heart overflowed
with &longs;ympathy, and my eyes with unbidden tears.







This de&longs;cription will appear to you trifling or
incredible. The importance of the&longs;e circum&longs;tances
will be manife&longs;ted in the
&longs;equel. The manner in
which I was affected on this occa&longs;ion, was, to
my own apprehen&longs;ion, a &longs;ubject of a&longs;toni&longs;hment.
The tones were indeed &longs;uch as I never heard before;
but that they &longs;hould, in an in&longs;tant, as it
were, di&longs;&longs;olve me in tears, will not ea&longs;ily believed
by others, and can &longs;carcely be comprehended
by my&longs;elf.
It will be readily &longs;uppo&longs;ed that I was &longs;omewhat
inqui&longs;itive as to the per&longs;on and demeanour of our
vi&longs;itant. After a moment's pau&longs;e, I &longs;tepped to the
door and looked after him. Judge my &longs;urprize,
when I beheld the &longs;elf-&longs;ame figure that had appeared
an half hour before upon the bank. My fancy
had conjured up a very different image. A form,
and attitude, and garb, were in&longs;tantly created worthy
to accompany &longs;uch elocution; but this per&longs;on
was, in all vi&longs;ible re&longs;pects, the rever&longs;e of this phantom.
Strange as it may &longs;eem, I could not &longs;peedily
reconcile my&longs;elf to this di&longs;appointment. In&longs;tead
of returning to my employment, I threw my&longs;elf in
a chair that was placed oppo&longs;ite the door, and &longs;unk
into a fit of mu&longs;ing.
My attention was, in a few minutes, recalled
by the &longs;tranger, who returned with the empty cup
in his hand. I had not thought of the circumstance,
or &longs;hould certainly have cho&longs;en a different
&longs;eat. He no &longs;ooner &longs;hewed him&longs;elf, than a confused
&longs;en&longs;e of impropriety, added to the &longs;uddenne&longs;s
of the interview, for which, not having fore&longs;een it,
I had made no preparation, threw me into a &longs;tate
of the mo&longs;t painful embarra&longs;&longs;ment. He brought
with him a placid brow; but no &longs;ooner had he ca&longs;t
his eyes upon me, than his face was as glowingly




&longs;uffu&longs;ed as my own. He placed the cup upon the
bench, &longs;tammered out thanks, and retired.
It was &longs;ome time before I could recover my wonted
compo&longs;ure. I had &longs;natched a view of the &longs;tranger's
countenance. The impre&longs;&longs;ion that it made was
vivid and indelible. His cheeks were pallid and
lank, his eyes &longs;unken, his forehead over&longs;hadowed
by coar&longs;e &longs;traggling hairs, his teeth large and irregular,
though &longs;ound and brilliantly white, and his
chin di&longs;coloured by a tetter. His &longs;kin was of
coar&longs;e grain, and &longs;allow hue. Every feature was
wide of beauty, and the outline of his face reminded
you of an inverted cone.
And yet his forehead, &longs;o far as &longs;haggy locks.
would allow it to be &longs;een, his eyes
lu&longs;trou&longs;ly black,
and po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;ing, in the mid&longs;t of haggardne&longs;s, a radiance
inexpre&longs;&longs;ibly &longs;erene and potent, and &longs;omething
in the re&longs;t of his features, which it would be in
vain to de&longs;cribe, but which &longs;erved to betoken a
mind of the highe&longs;t order, were e&longs;&longs;ential ingredients
in the portrait. This, in the effects which immediately
flowed from it, I count among the mo&longs;t extraordinary
incidents of my life. This face, &longs;een
for a moment, continued for hours to occupy my
fancy, to the exclu&longs;ion of almo&longs;t every other image.
I had purpo&longs;ed to &longs;pend the evening with my brother,
but I could not re&longs;i&longs;t the inclination of forming
a &longs;ketch upon paper of this memorable vi&longs;age.
Whether my hand was aided by any peculiar inspiration,
or I was deceived by my own fond conceptions,
this portrait, though ha&longs;tily executed, appeared
unexceptionable to my own ta&longs;te.
I placed it at all di&longs;tances, and in all lights; my
eyes were rivetted upon it. Half the night pa&longs;&longs;ed
away in wakefulne&longs;s and in contemplation of this
picture. So flexible, and yet &longs;o &longs;tubborn, is the




human mind. So obedient to impul&longs;es the mo&longs;t
tran&longs;ient and brief, and yet &longs;o unalterably ob&longs;ervant
of the direction which is given to it! How little did
I then fore&longs;ee the termination of that chain, of which
this may be regarded as the fir&longs;t link?
Next day aro&longs;e in darkne&longs;s and &longs;torm. Torrents
of rain fell during the whole day, attended
with ince&longs;&longs;ant thunder, which reverberated in stunning
echoes from the oppo&longs;ite declivity. The inclemency
of the air would not allow me to walk
out. I had, indeed, no inclination to leave my
apartment. I betook my&longs;elf to the contemplation
of this portrait, who&longs;e attractions time had
rather enhanced than dimini&longs;hed. I laid a&longs;ide my
u&longs;ual occupations, and &longs;eating my&longs;elf at a window,
con&longs;umed the day in alternately looking out upon
the &longs;torm, and gazing at the picture which lay
upon a table before me. You will, perhaps, deem
this conduct &longs;omewhat &longs;ingular, and a&longs;cribe it to
certain peculiarities of temper. I am not aware
of any &longs;uch peculiarities. I can account for my
devotion to this image no otherwi&longs;e, than by supposing
that its properties were rare and prodigious.
Perhaps you will &longs;u&longs;pect that &longs;uch were the fir&longs;t inroads
of a pa&longs;&longs;ion incident to every female heart,
and which frequently gains a &longs;ooting by means even
more &longs;light, and more improbable than the&longs;e. I
&longs;hall not controvert the rea&longs;onablene&longs;s of the suspicion,
but leave you at liberty to draw; from my
narrative, what conclu&longs;ions you plea&longs;e.
Night at length returned, and the &longs;torm cea&longs;ed.
The air was once more clear and calm, and bore
an a&longs;&longs;ecting contra&longs;t to that uproar of the elements
by which it had been preceded. I &longs;pent the darksome
hours, as I &longs;pent the day, contemplative and
&longs;eated at the window. Why was my mind




absorbed in thoughts ominous and dreary? Why did
my bo&longs;om heave with &longs;ighs, and my eyes overflow
with tears? Was the tempe&longs;t that had ju&longs;t pa&longs;t
a &longs;ignal of the ruin which impended over me?
My &longs;oul fondly dwelt upon the images of my
brother and his children, yet they only increa&longs;ed
the mournfulne&longs;s of my contemplations. The
&longs;miles of the charming babes were as bland as
formerly. The &longs;ame dignity &longs;at on the brow of
their father, and yet I thought of them with anguish.
Something whi&longs;pered that the happine&longs;s
we at pre&longs;ent enjoyed was &longs;et on mutable foundations.
Death mu&longs;t happen to all. Whether our
felicity was to be &longs;ubverted by it to-morrow, or
whether it was ordained that we &longs;hould lay down
our heads full of years and of honor, was a que&longs;tion
that no human being could &longs;olve. At other times,
the&longs;e ideas &longs;eldom intruded. I either forbore to reflect
upon the de&longs;tiny that is re&longs;erved for all men,
or the reflection was mixed up with images that
di&longs;robed it of terror; but now the uncertainty of life
occurred to me without any of its u&longs;ual and alleviating
accompaniments. I &longs;aid to my&longs;elf, we mu&longs;t
die. Sooner or later, we mu&longs;t di&longs;appear for ever
from the face of the earth. Whatever be the links
that hold us to life, they mu&longs;t be broken. This
&longs;cene of exi&longs;tence is, in all its parts, calamitous. The
greater number is oppre&longs;&longs;ed with immediate evils,
and tho&longs;e, the tide of who&longs;e fortunes is full, how
&longs;inall is their portion of enjoyment, &longs;ince they know
that it will terminate.
For &longs;ome time I indulged my&longs;elf, without reluctance,
in the&longs;e gloomy thoughts; but at length,
the dejection which they produced became insupportably
painful. I endeavoured to di&longs;&longs;ipate it with
mu&longs;ic. I had all my grand-father's melody as well





as poetry by rote. I now lighted by chance on a
ballad, which commemorated the fate of a German
Cavalier, who fell at the &longs;iege of Nice under Godfrey
of Bouillon. My choice was unfortunate, for
the &longs;cenes of violence and carnage which were here
wildly but forcibly pourtrayed, only &longs;ugge&longs;ted to
my thoughts a new topic in the horrors of war.
I &longs;ought refuge, but ineffectually, in &longs;leep. My
mind was thronged by vivid, but confu&longs;ed images,
and no effort that I made was &longs;ufficient to drive
them away. In this &longs;ituation I heard the clock,
which hung in the room, give the &longs;ignal for twelve.
It was the &longs;ame in&longs;trument which formerly hung
in my father's chamber, and which, on account of
its being his workman&longs;hip, was regarded, by every
one of our family, with veneration. It had fallen
to me, in the divi&longs;ion of his property, and was
placed in this a&longs;ylum. The &longs;ound awakened a
&longs;eries of reflections, re&longs;pecting his death. I was
not allowed to pur&longs;ue them; for &longs;carcely had the
vibrations cea&longs;ed, when my attention was attracted
by a whi&longs;per, which, at fir&longs;t, appeared to proceed
from lips that were laid clo&longs;e to my ear.
No wonder that a circum&longs;tance like this &longs;tartled
me. In the fir&longs;t impul&longs;e of my terror, I uttered a
&longs;light &longs;cream, and &longs;hrunk to the oppo&longs;ite &longs;ide of the
bed. In a moment, however, I recovered from my
trepidation. I was habitually indifferent to all the
cau&longs;es of fear, by which the majority are afflicted.
I entertained no apprehen&longs;ion of either gho&longs;ts or
robbers. Our &longs;ecurity had never been mole&longs;ted by
either, and I made u&longs;e of no means to prevent or
counterwork their machinations. My tranquillity,
on this occa&longs;ion, was quickly retrieved. The
whi&longs;per evidently proceeded from one who was
po&longs;ted at my bed-&longs;ide. The fir&longs;t idea that &longs;ugge&longs;ted




it&longs;elf was, that it was uttered by the girl who lived
with me as a &longs;ervant. Perhaps, &longs;omewhat had
alarmed her, or &longs;he was &longs;ick, and had come to request
my a&longs;&longs;i&longs;tance. By whi&longs;pering in my ear, &longs;he
intended to rou&longs;e without alarming me.
Full of this per&longs;ua&longs;ion, I called; “Judith,” &longs;aid
I, “is it you? What do you want? Is there
any thing the matter with you?” No an&longs;wer was
returned. I repeated my inquiry, but equally in
vain. Cloudy as was the atmo&longs;phere, and curtained
as my bed was, nothing was vi&longs;ible, I
withdrew the curtain, and leaning my head on my
elbow, I li&longs;tened with the deepe&longs;t attention to catch
&longs;ome new &longs;ound. Meanwhile, I ran over in my
thoughts, every circum&longs;tance that could a&longs;&longs;i&longs;t my
conjectures.
My habitation was a wooden edifice, con&longs;i&longs;ting
of two &longs;tories. In each &longs;tory were two rooms,
&longs;eparated by an entry, or middle pa&longs;&longs;age, with
which they communicated by oppo&longs;ite doors. The
pa&longs;&longs;age, on the lower &longs;tory, had doors at the two
ends, and a &longs;tair-ca&longs;e. Windows an&longs;wered to the
doors on the upper &longs;tory. Annexed to this, on the
ea&longs;tern &longs;ide, were wings, divided, in like manner,
into an upper and lower room; one of them comprized
a kitchen, and chamber above it for the servant,
and communicated, on both &longs;tories, with the
parlour adjoining it below, and the chamber adjoining
it above. The oppo&longs;ite wing is of &longs;maller
dimen&longs;ions, the rooms not being above eight feet
&longs;quare. The lower of the&longs;e was u&longs;ed as a depository
of hou&longs;ehold implements, the upper was a
clo&longs;et in which I depo&longs;ited my books and papers.
They had but one inlet, which was from the room
adjoining. There was no window in the lower
one, and in the upper, a &longs;mall aperture which




communicated light and air, but would &longs;carcely admit
the body. The door which led into this, was
clo&longs;e to my bed-head, and was always locked, but
when I my&longs;elf was within. The avenues below
were accu&longs;tomed to be clo&longs;ed and bolted at nights.
The maid was my only companion, and &longs;he
could not reach my chamber without previou&longs;ly
pa&longs;&longs;ing through the oppo&longs;ite chamber, and the middle
pa&longs;&longs;age, of which, however, the doors were
u&longs;ually unfa&longs;tened. If &longs;he had occa&longs;ioned this
noi&longs;e, &longs;he would have an&longs;wered my repeated calls.
No other conclu&longs;ion, therefore, was left me, but
that I had mi&longs;taken the &longs;ounds, and that my imagination
had transformed &longs;ome ca&longs;ual noi&longs;e into the
voice of a human creature. Satisfied with this
&longs;olution, I was preparing to relinqui&longs;h my li&longs;tening
attitude, when my ear was again &longs;aluted with a
new and yet louder whi&longs;pering. It appeared, as before,
to i&longs;&longs;ue from lips that touched my pillow. A
&longs;econd effort of attention, however, clearly &longs;hewed
me, that the &longs;ounds i&longs;&longs;ued from within the clo&longs;et,
the door of which was not more than eight inches
from my pillow.
This &longs;econd interruption occa&longs;ioned a &longs;hock le&longs;s
vehement than the former. I &longs;tarted, but gave no
audible token of alarm. I was &longs;o much mi&longs;tre&longs;s
of my feelings, as to continue li&longs;tening to what
&longs;hould be &longs;aid. The whi&longs;per was di&longs;tinct, hoar&longs;e,
and uttered &longs;o as to &longs;hew that the &longs;peaker was desirous
of being heard by &longs;ome one near, but, at
the &longs;ame time, &longs;tudious to avoid being overheard
by any other.
“Stop, &longs;top, I &longs;ay; madmam as you are! there
are better means than that. Cur&longs;e upon your
ra&longs;hne&longs;s! There is no need to &longs;hoot.”
Such were the words uttered in a tone of




eagerness and anger, within &longs;o &longs;mall a di&longs;tance of
my pillow. What con&longs;truction could I put upon
them? My heart began to palpitate with dread of
&longs;ome unknown danger. Pre&longs;ently, another voice,
but equally near me, was heard whi&longs;pering in answer.
“Why not? I will draw a trigger in this
bu&longs;ine&longs;s, but perdition be my lot if I do more.”
To this, the fir&longs;t voice returned, in a tone which
rage had heightened in a &longs;mall degree above a
whi&longs;per, “Coward! &longs;tand a&longs;ide, and &longs;ee me do
it. I will gra&longs;p her throat; I will do her bu&longs;ine&longs;s
in an in&longs;tant; &longs;he &longs;hall not have time &longs;o much
as to groan.” What wonder that I was petrified
by &longs;ounds &longs;o dreadful! Murderers lurked in my
clo&longs;et. They were planning the means of my destruction.
One re&longs;olved to &longs;hoot, and the other
menaced &longs;uffocation. Their means being cho&longs;en,
they would forthwith break the door. Flight instantly
&longs;ugge&longs;ted it&longs;elf as mo&longs;t eligible in circumstances
&longs;o perilous. I deliberated not a moment;
but, fear adding wings to my &longs;peed, I leaped out
of bed, and &longs;cantily robed as I was, ru&longs;hed out of
the chamber, down &longs;tairs, and into the open air.
I can hardly recollect the proce&longs;s of turning keys,
and withdrawing bolts. My terrors urged me
forward with almo&longs;t a mechanical impul&longs;e. I
&longs;topped not till I reached my brother's door. I
had not gained the thre&longs;hold, when, exhau&longs;ted by
the violence of my emotions, and by my &longs;peed, I
&longs;unk down in a &longs;it.
How long I remained in this &longs;ituation I know
not. When I recovered, I found my&longs;elf &longs;tretched
on a bed, &longs;urrounded by my &longs;i&longs;ter and her female
&longs;ervants. I was a&longs;tonished at the &longs;cene before me,
but gradually recovered the recollection of what
had happened. I an&longs;wered their importunate




inquiries as well as I was able. My brother and
Pleyel, whom the &longs;torm of the preceding day
chanced to detain here, informing them&longs;elves of
every particular, proceeded with lights and weapons
to my de&longs;erted habitation. They entered my chamber
and my clo&longs;et, and found every thing in its proper
place and cu&longs;tomary order. The door of the
clo&longs;et was locked, and appeared not to have been
opened in my ab&longs;ence. They went to Judith's
apartment. They found her a&longs;leep and in &longs;afety.
Pleyel's caution induced him to forbear alarming
the girl; and finding her wholly ignorant of what
had pa&longs;&longs;ed, they directed her to return to her chamber.
They then fa&longs;tened the doors, and returned.
My friends were di&longs;po&longs;ed to regard this transaction
as a dream. That per&longs;ons &longs;hould be actually
immured in this clo&longs;et, to which, in the circumstances
of the time, acce&longs;s from without or within
was apparently impo&longs;&longs;ible, they could not &longs;eriou&longs;ly
believe. That any human beings had intended
murder, unle&longs;s it were to cover a &longs;cheme of pillage,
was incredible; but that no &longs;uch de&longs;ign had been
formed, was evident from the &longs;ecurity in which the
furniture of the hou&longs;e and the clo&longs;et remained.
I revolved every incident and expre&longs;&longs;ion that had
occurred. My &longs;en&longs;es a&longs;&longs;ured me of the truth of
them, and yet their abruptne&longs;s and improbability
made me, in my turn, &longs;omewhat incredulous. The
adventure had made a deep impre&longs;&longs;ion on my fancy,
and it was not till after a week's abode at my brother's,
that I re&longs;olved to re&longs;ume the po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;ion of
my own dwelling.
There was another circum&longs;tance that enhanced
the my&longs;teriou&longs;ne&longs;s of this event. After my recovery
it was obvious to inquire by what means the attention
of the family had been drawn to my &longs;ituation.




I had fallen before I had reached the thre&longs;hold, or
was able to give any &longs;ignal. My brother related,
that while this was tran&longs;acting in my chamber, he
him&longs;elf was awake, in con&longs;equence of &longs;ome &longs;light
indi&longs;po&longs;ition, and lay, according to his cu&longs;tom,
mu&longs;ing on &longs;ome &longs;avorite topic. Suddenly the
&longs;ilence, which was remarkably profound, was broken
by a voice of mo&longs;t piercing &longs;hrillne&longs;s, that
&longs;eemed to be uttered by one in the hall below his
chamber. “Awake! ari&longs;e!” it exclaimed: “hasten
to &longs;uccour one that is dying at your door.”
This &longs;ummons was effectual. There was no
one in the hou&longs;e who was not rou&longs;ed by it. Pleyel
was the fir&longs;t to obey, and my brother overtook him
before he reached the hall. What was the general
a&longs;toni&longs;hment when your friend was di&longs;covered
&longs;tretched upon the gra&longs;s before the door, pale,
gha&longs;tly, and with every mark of death!
This was the third in&longs;tance of a voice, exerted
for the benefit of this little community. The agent
was no le&longs;s in&longs;crutable in this, than in the former
ca&longs;e. When I ruminated upon the&longs;e events, my
&longs;oul was &longs;u&longs;pended in wonder and awe. Was I
really deceived in imagining that I heard the clo&longs;et
conver&longs;ation? I was no longer at liberty to question
the reality of tho&longs;e accents which had formerly
recalled my brother from the hill; which had imparted
tidings of the death of the German lady to
Pleyel; and which had lately &longs;ummoned them to
my a&longs;&longs;i&longs;tance.
But how was I to regard this midnight conversation?
Hoar&longs;e and manlike voices con&longs;erring on
the means of death, &longs;o near my bed, and at &longs;uch
an hour! How had my ancient &longs;ecurity vani&longs;hed!
That dwelling, which had hitherto been an inviolate
a&longs;ylum, was now be&longs;et with danger to my life.




That &longs;olitude, formerly &longs;o dear to me, could no
longer be endured. Pleyel, who had con&longs;ented to
re&longs;ide with us during the months of &longs;pring, lodged
in the vacant chamber, in order to quiet my alarms.
He treated my fears with ridicule, and in a &longs;hort
time very &longs;ight traces of them remained: but as it
was wholly indifferent to him whether his nights
were pa&longs;&longs;ed at my hou&longs;e or at my brother's, this
arrangement gave general &longs;atisfaction.
