I had imperfectly recovered my &longs;trength, when
I was informed of the arrival of my mother's brother,
Thomas Cambridge. Ten years &longs;ince, he
went to Europe, and was a &longs;urgeon in the Briti&longs;h
forces in Germany, during the whole of the late
war. After its conclu&longs;ion, &longs;ome connection that
he had formed with an Iri&longs;h officer, made him retire
into Ireland. Intercour&longs;e had been punctually
maintained by letters with his &longs;i&longs;ter's children, and
hopes were given that he would &longs;hortly return to
his native country, and pa&longs;s his old age in our society.
He was now in an evil hour arrived.
I de&longs;ired an interview with him for numerous
and urgent rea&longs;ons. With the fir&longs;t returns of my
under&longs;tanding I had anxiou&longs;ly &longs;ought information
of the fate of my brother. During the cour&longs;e of
my di&longs;ea&longs;e I had never &longs;een him; and vague and
un&longs;atisfactory an&longs;wers were returned to all my inquiries.
I had vehemently interrogated Mrs. Hallet
and her hu&longs;band, and &longs;olicited an interview with
this unfortunate man; but they my&longs;teriou&longs;ly insinuated
that his rea&longs;on was &longs;till un&longs;ettled, and that
his circum&longs;tances rendered an interview impo&longs;&longs;ible.
Their re&longs;erve on the particulars of this de&longs;truction,
and the author of it, was equally invincible.
For &longs;ome time, finding all my efforts fruitle&longs;s, I
had de&longs;i&longs;ted from direct inquiries and &longs;olicitations,
determined, as &longs;oon as my &longs;trength was &longs;ufficiently
renewed, to pur&longs;ue other means of di&longs;pelling my




uncertainty. In this &longs;tate of things my uncle's arrival
and intention to vi&longs;it me were announced. I
almo&longs;t &longs;huddered to behold the face of this man.
When I reflected on the di&longs;a&longs;ters that had befallen
us, I was half unwilling to witne&longs;s that dejection
and grief which would be di&longs;clo&longs;ed in his countenance.
But I believed that all tran&longs;actions had
been thoroughly di&longs;clo&longs;ed to him, and confided in
my importunity to extort from him the knowledge
that I &longs;ought.
I had no doubt as to the per&longs;on of our enemy;
but the motives that urged him to perpetrate the&longs;e
horrors, the means that he u&longs;ed, and his pre&longs;ent
condition, were totally unknown. It was reasonable
to expect &longs;ome information on this head, from
my uncle. I therefore waited his coming with
impatience. At length, in the du&longs;k of the evening,
and in my &longs;olitary chamber, this meeting took
place.
This man was our neare&longs;t relation, and had ever
treated us with the affection of a parent. Our
meeting, therefore, could not be without overflowing
tenderne&longs;s and gloomy joy. He rather encouraged
than re&longs;trained the tears that I poured out
in his arms, and took upon him&longs;elf the ta&longs;k of
comforter. Allu&longs;ions to recent di&longs;a&longs;ters could not
be long omitted. One topic facilitated the admission
of another. At length, I mentioned and deplored
the ignorance in which I had been kept respecting
my brother's de&longs;tiny, and the circumstances
of our misfortunes. I entreated him to tell
me what was Wieland's condition, and what progress
had been made in detecting or puni&longs;hing the
author of this unheard-of deva&longs;tation.
“The author!” &longs;aid he; “Do you know the
author?”






“Alas!” I an&longs;wered, “I am too well acquainted
with him. The &longs;tory of the grounds of my suspicions
would be painful and too long. I am not
apprized of the extent of your pre&longs;ent knowledge.
There are none but Wieland, Pleyel, and my&longs;elf,
who are able to relate certain facts.”
“Spare your&longs;elf the pain,” &longs;aid he. “All that
Wieland and Pleyel can communicate, I know
already. If any thing of moment has fallen within
your own exclu&longs;ive knowledge, and the relation be
not too arduous for your pre&longs;ent &longs;trength, I confe&longs;s I
am de&longs;irous of hearing it. Perhaps you allude to
one by the name of Carwin. I will anticipate your
curio&longs;ity by &longs;aying, that &longs;ince the&longs;e di&longs;a&longs;ters, no
one has &longs;een or heard of him. His agency is,
therefore, a my&longs;tery &longs;till un&longs;olved.”
I readily complied with his reque&longs;t, and related
as di&longs;tinctly as I could, though in general terms,
the events tran&longs;acted in the &longs;ummer-hou&longs;e and my
chamber. He li&longs;tened without apparent &longs;urprize
to the tale of Pleyel's errors and &longs;u&longs;p cions, and with
augmented &longs;eriou&longs;ne&longs;s, to my narrative of the warnings
and inexplicable vi&longs;ion, and the letter found
up on the table. I waited for his comments.
“You gather from this,” &longs;aid he, “that Carwin
is the author of all this mi&longs;ery.”
“Is it not,” an&longs;wered I, “an unavoidable inference?
But what know you re&longs;pecting it? Was
it po&longs;&longs;ible to execute this mi&longs;chief without witne&longs;s
or coadjutor? I be&longs;eech you to relate to me,
when and why Mr. Hallet was &longs;ummoned to the
&longs;cene, and by whom this di&longs;a&longs;ter was fir&longs;t &longs;u&longs;pected
or di&longs;covered. Surely, &longs;u&longs;picion mu&longs;t have fallen
upon &longs;ome one, and pur&longs;uit was made.”
My uncle ro&longs;e from his &longs;eat, and traver&longs;ed the
floor with ha&longs;ty &longs;teps. His eyes were fixed upon




the ground, and he &longs;eemed buried in perplexity.
At length he pau&longs;ed, and &longs;aid with an emphatic
tone, “It is true; the in&longs;trument is known. Carwin
may have plotted, but the execution was another's.
That other is found, and his deed is ascertained.”

“Good heaven!” I exclaimed, “what &longs;ay you?
Was not Carwin the a&longs;&longs;a&longs;&longs;in? Could any hand but
his have carried into act this dreadful purpo&longs;e?”
“Have I not &longs;aid,” returned he, “that the performance
was another's? Carwin, perhaps, or
heaven, or in&longs;anity, prompted the murderer; but
Carwin is unknown. The actual performer has,
long &longs;ince, been called to judgment and convicted,
and is, at this moment, at the bottom of a dungeon
loaded with chains.”
I lifted my hands and eyes. “Who then is
this a&longs;&longs;a&longs;&longs;in? By what means, and whither was
he traced? What is the te&longs;timony of his guilt?”
“His own, corroborated with that of a servantmaid
who &longs;pied the murder of the children from a
clo&longs;et where &longs;he was concealed. The magi&longs;trate returned
from your dwelling to your brother's. He
was employed in hearing and recording the testimony
of the only witne&longs;s, when the criminal himself,
unexpected, un&longs;olicited, un&longs;ought, entered the
hall, acknowledged his guilt, and rendered him&longs;elf
up to ju&longs;tice.
“He has &longs;ince been &longs;ummoned to the bar. The
audience was compo&longs;ed of thou&longs;ands whom rumours
of this wonderful event had attracted from
the greate&longs;t di&longs;tance. A long and impartial examination
was made, and the pri&longs;oner was called
upon for his defence. In compliance with this
call he delivered an ample relation of his motives
and actions.” There he &longs;topped.







I be&longs;ought him to &longs;ay who this criminal was, and
what the in&longs;tigations that compelled him. My
uncle was &longs;ilent. I urged this inquiry with new
force. I reverted to my own knowledge, and
&longs;ought in this &longs;ome ba&longs;is to conjecture. I ran over
the &longs;canty catalogue of the men whom I knew; I
lighted on no one who was qualified for ministering
to malice like this. Again I re&longs;orted to importunity.
Had I ever &longs;een the criminal? Was
it &longs;heer cruelty, or diabolical revenge that produced
this overthrow?
He &longs;urveyed me, for a con&longs;iderable time, and
li&longs;tened to my interrogations in &longs;ilence. At length
he &longs;poke: “Clara, I have known thee by report,
and in &longs;ome degree by ob&longs;ervation. Thou art a
being of no vulgar &longs;ort. Thy friends have hitherto
treated thee as a child. They meant well, but,
perhaps, they were unacquainted with thy &longs;trength.
I a&longs;&longs;ure my&longs;elf that nothing will &longs;urpa&longs;s thy fortitude.

“Thou art anxious to know the de&longs;troyer of
thy family, his actions, and his motives. Shall I
call him to thy pre&longs;ence, and permit him to confe&longs;s
before thee? Shall I make him the narrator of his
own tale?”
I &longs;tarted on my feet, and looked round me with
fearful glances, as if the murderer was clo&longs;e at
hand. “What do you mean?” &longs;aid I; “put an
end, I be&longs;eech you, to this &longs;u&longs;pence.”
“Be not alarmed; you will never more behold
the face of this criminal, unle&longs;s he be gifted with
&longs;upernatural &longs;trength, and &longs;ever like threads the
con&longs;traint of links and bolts. I have &longs;aid that the
a&longs;&longs;a&longs;&longs;in was arraigned at the bar, and that the trial
ended with a &longs;ummons from the judge to confe&longs;s or
to vindicate his actions. A reply was immediately




made with &longs;ignificance of ge&longs;ture, and a tranquil
maje&longs;ty, which denoted le&longs;s of humanity than godhead.
Judges, advocates and auditors were panicstruck
and breathle&longs;s with attention. One of the
hearers faithfully recorded the &longs;peech. There it
is,” continued he, putting a roll of papers in my
hand, “you may read it at your lei&longs;ure.”
With the&longs;e words my uncle left me alone. My
curio&longs;ity refu&longs;ed me a moment's delay. I opened
the papers, and read as follows.
