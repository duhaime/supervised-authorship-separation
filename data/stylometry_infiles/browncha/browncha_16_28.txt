A Few words more and I lay a&longs;ide the pen for
ever. Yet why &longs;hould I not relinqui&longs;h it now?
All that I have &longs;aid is preparatory to this &longs;cene, and
my fingers, tremulous and cold as my heart, refu&longs;e
any further exertion. This mu&longs;t not be. Let my
la&longs;t energies &longs;upport me in the fini&longs;hing of this
ta&longs;k. Then will I lay down my head in the lap of
death. Hu&longs;hed will be all my murmurs in the &longs;leep
of the grave.
Every &longs;entiment has peri&longs;hed in my bo&longs;om.
Even friend&longs;hip is extinct. Your love for me has
prompted me to this ta&longs;k; but I would not have
complied if it had not been a luxury thus to fea&longs;t
upon my woes. I have ju&longs;tly calculated upon my
remnant of &longs;trength. When I lay down the pen
the taper of life will expire: my exi&longs;tence will terminate
with my tale.
Now that I was left alone with Wieland, the
perils of my &longs;ituation pre&longs;ented them&longs;elves to my
mind. That this paroxy&longs;m &longs;hould terminate in
havock and rage it was rea&longs;onable to predict. The
fir&longs;t &longs;ugge&longs;tion of my fears had been di&longs;proved by
my experience. Carwin had acknowledged his offences,
and yet had e&longs;caped. The vengeance which
I had harboured had not been admitted by Wieland,
and yet the evils which I had endured, compared
with tho&longs;e inflicted on my brother, were as nothing.
I thir&longs;ted for his blood, and was tormented with an
in&longs;atiable appetite for his de&longs;truction; yet my




brother was unmoved, and had di&longs;mi&longs;&longs;ed him in &longs;afety.
Surely thou wa&longs;t more than man, while I am &longs;unk
below the bea&longs;ts.
Did I place a right con&longs;truction on the conduct
of Wieland? Was the error that mi&longs;led him &longs;o
ea&longs;ily rectified? Were views &longs;o vivid and faith &longs;o
&longs;trenuous thus liable to fading and to change? Was
there not rea&longs;on to doubt the accuracy of my perceptions?
With images like the&longs;e was my mind
thronged, till the deportment of my brother called
away my attention.
I &longs;aw his lips move and his eyes ca&longs;t up to heaven.
Then would he li&longs;ten and look back, as if in
expectation of &longs;ome one's appearance. Thrice
he repeated the&longs;e ge&longs;ticulations and this inaudible
prayer. Each time the mi&longs;t of confu&longs;ion and doubt
&longs;eemed to grow darker and to &longs;ettle on his understanding.
I gue&longs;&longs;ed at the meaning of the&longs;e tokens.
The words of Carwin had &longs;haken his belief, and
he was employed in &longs;ummoning the me&longs;&longs;enger who
had formerly communed with him, to atte&longs;t the
value of tho&longs;e new doubts. In vain the &longs;ummons
was repeated, for his eye met nothing but vacancy,
and not a &longs;ound &longs;aluted his ear.
He walked to the bed, gazed with eagerne&longs;s at
the pillow which had &longs;u&longs;tained the head of the
breathle&longs;s Catharine, and then returned to the place
where I &longs;at. I had no power to li&longs;t my eyes to his
face: I was dubious of his purpo&longs;e: this purpo&longs;e
might aim at my life.
Alas! nothing but &longs;ubjection to danger, and exposure
to temptation, can &longs;how us what we are.
By this te&longs;t was I now tried, and found to be cowardly
and ra&longs;h. Men can deliberately untie the
thread of life, and of this I had deemed my&longs;elf capable;
yet now that I &longs;tood upon the brink of fate,




that the knife of the &longs;acrificer was aimed at my
heart, I &longs;huddered and betook my&longs;elf to any means
of e&longs;cape, however mon&longs;trous.
Can I bear to think—can I endure to relate the
outrage which my heart meditated? Where were
my means of &longs;afety? Re&longs;i&longs;tance was vain. Not
even the energy of de&longs;pair could &longs;et me on a level
with that &longs;trength which his terrific prompter had
be&longs;towed upon Wieland. Terror enables us to
perform incredible &longs;eats; but terror was not then
the &longs;tate of my mind; where then were my hopes
of re&longs;cue?
Methinks it is too much. I &longs;tand a&longs;ide, as it
were, from my&longs;elf; I e&longs;timate my own de&longs;ervings;
a hatred, immortal and inexorable, is my due. I
li&longs;ten to my own pleas, and find them empty and
fal&longs;e: yes, I acknowledge that my guilt &longs;urpa&longs;&longs;es
that of all mankind: I confe&longs;s that the cur&longs;es of a
world, and the frowns of a deity, are inadequate
to my demerits. Is there a thing in the world worthy
of infinite abhorrence? It is I.
What &longs;hall I &longs;ay! I was menaced, as I thought,
with death, and, to elude this evil, my hand was
ready to inflict death upon the menacer. In visiting
my hou&longs;e, I had made provi&longs;ion again&longs;t the
machinations of Carwin. In a fold of my dre&longs;s an
open penknife was concealed. This I now &longs;eized
and drew forth. It lurked out of view; but I now
&longs;ee that my &longs;tate of mind would have rendered the
deed inevitable if my brother had lifted his hand.
This in&longs;trument of my pre&longs;ervation would have
been plunged into his heart.
O, in&longs;upportable remembrance! hide thee from
my view for a time; hide it from me that my heart
was black enough to meditate the &longs;tabbing of a




brother! a brother thus &longs;upreme in mi&longs;ery; thus
towering in virtue!
He was probably uncon&longs;cious of my de&longs;ign, but
pre&longs;ently drew back. This interval was &longs;ufficient
to re&longs;tore me to my&longs;elf. The madne&longs;s, the iniquity
of that act which I had purpo&longs;ed ru&longs;hed upon my
apprehen&longs;ion. For a moment I was breathle&longs;s with
agony. At the next moment I recovered my
&longs;trength, and threw the knife with violence on the
floor.
The &longs;ound awoke my brother from his reverie.
He gazed alternately at me and at the weapon.
With a movement equally &longs;olemn he &longs;tooped and
took it up. He placed the blade in different positions,
&longs;crutinizing it accurately, and maintaining,
at the &longs;ame time, a profound &longs;ilence.
Again he looked at me, but all that vehemence
and loftine&longs;s of &longs;pirit which had &longs;o lately characterized
his features, were flown. Fallen mu&longs;cles,
a forehead contracted into folds, eyes dim with unbidden
drops, and a ruefulne&longs;s of a&longs;pect which no
words can de&longs;cribe, were now vi&longs;ible.
His looks touched into energy the &longs;ame sympathies
in me, and I poured forth a flood of tears.
This pa&longs;&longs;ion was quickly checked by fear, which
had now, no longer, my own, but his &longs;afety for
their object. I watched his deportment in &longs;ilence.
At length he &longs;poke:
“Si&longs;ter,” &longs;aid he, in an accent mournful and
mild, “I have acted poorly my part in this world.
What thinke&longs;t thou? Shall I not do better in the
next?”
I could make no an&longs;wer. The mildne&longs;s of his
tone a&longs;toni&longs;hed and encouraged me. I continued
to regard him with wi&longs;tful and anxious looks.






“I think,” re&longs;umed he, “I will try. My wife
and my babes have gone before. Happy wretches!
I have &longs;ent you to repo&longs;e, and ought not to linger
behind.”
The&longs;e words had a meaning &longs;ufficiently intelligible.
I looked at the open knife in his hand and
&longs;huddered, but knew not how to prevent the deed
which I dreaded. He quickly noticed my fears,
and comprehended them. Stretching towards me his
hand, with an air of increa&longs;ing mildne&longs;s: “Take
it,” &longs;aid he: “Fear not for thy own &longs;ake, nor
for mine. The cup is gone by, and its tran&longs;ient
inebriation is &longs;ucceeded by the &longs;oberne&longs;s of truth.
“Thou angel whom I was wont to wor&longs;hip!
feare&longs;t thou, my &longs;i&longs;ter, for thy life? Once it was
the &longs;cope of my labours to de&longs;troy thee, but I was
prompted to the deed by heaven; &longs;uch, at lea&longs;t, was
my belief. Thinke&longs;t thou that thy death was &longs;ought
to gratify malevolence? No. I am pure from all
&longs;tain. I believed that my God was my mover!
“Neither thee nor my&longs;elf have I cau&longs;e to injure.
I have done my duty, and &longs;urely there is merit in
having &longs;acrificed to that, all that is dear to the heart
of man. If a devil has deceived me, he came in
the habit of an angel. If I erred, it was not my
judgment that deceived me, but my &longs;en&longs;es. In thy
&longs;ight, being of beings! I am &longs;till pure. Still will
I look for my reward in thy ju&longs;tice!”
Did my ears truly report the&longs;e &longs;ounds? If I did
not err, my brother was re&longs;tored to ju&longs;t perceptions.
He knew him&longs;elf to have been betrayed to the murder
of his wife and children, to have been the victim
of infernal artifice; yet he found con&longs;olation in the
rectitude of his motives. He was not devoid of
&longs;orrow, for this was written on his countenance;
but his &longs;oul was tranquil and &longs;ublime.






Perhaps this was merely a tran&longs;ition of his former
madne&longs;s into a new &longs;hape. Perhaps he had not
yet awakened to the memory of the horrors which
he had perpetrated. Infatuated wretch that I was!
To &longs;et my&longs;elf up as a model by which to judge of
my heroic brother! My rea&longs;on taught me that his
conclu&longs;ions were right; but con&longs;cious of the impotence
of rea&longs;on over my own conduct; con&longs;cious of
my cowardly ra&longs;hne&longs;s and my criminal de&longs;pair, I
doubted whether any one could be &longs;tedfa&longs;t and wi&longs;e.
Such was my weakne&longs;s, that even in the mid&longs;t
of the&longs;e thoughts, my mind glided into abhorrence
of Carwin, and I uttered in a low voice, O! Carwin!
Carwin! What ha&longs;t thou to an&longs;wer for?
My brother immediately noticed the involuntary
exclamation: “Clara!” &longs;aid he, “be thy&longs;elf.
Equity u&longs;ed to be a theme for thy eloquence. Reduce
its le&longs;&longs;ons to practice, and be ju&longs;t to that unfortunate
man. The in&longs;trument has done its work,
and I am &longs;atisfied.
“I thank thee, my God, for this la&longs;t illumination!
My enemy is thine al&longs;o. I deemed him to
be man, the man with whom I have often communed;
but now thy goodne&longs;s has unveiled to me
his true nature. As the performer of thy behe&longs;ts,
he is my friend.”
My heart began now to mi&longs;give me. His mournful
a&longs;pect had gradually yielded place to a &longs;erene
brow. A new &longs;oul appeared to actuate his frame,
and his eyes to beam with preternatural lu&longs;tre.
The&longs;e &longs;ymptoms did not abate, and he continued:
“Clara! I mu&longs;t not leave thee in doubt. I know
not what brought about thy interview with the
being whom thou calle&longs;t Carwin. For a time, I
was guilty of thy error, and deduced from his incoherent
confe&longs;&longs;ions that I had been made the victim




of human malice. He left us at my bidding, and I
put up a prayer that my doubts &longs;hould be removed.
Thy eyes were &longs;hut, and thy ears &longs;ealed to the
vi&longs;ion that an&longs;wered my prayer.
“I was indeed deceived. The form thou ha&longs;t
&longs;een was the incarnation of a dæmon. The vi&longs;age
and voice which urged me to the &longs;acrifice of my
family, were his. Now he per&longs;onates a human
form: then he was invironed with the lu&longs;tre of
heaven.—
“Clara,” he continued, advancing clo&longs;er to me,
“thy death mu&longs;t come. This mini&longs;ter is evil, but
he from whom his commi&longs;&longs;ion was received is God.
Submit then with all thy wonted re&longs;ignation to a
decree that cannot be rever&longs;ed or re&longs;i&longs;ted. Mark
the clock. Three minutes are allowed to thee, in
which to call up thy fortitude, and prepare thee for
thy doom.” There he &longs;topped.
Even now, when this &longs;cene exi&longs;ts only in memory,
when life and all its functions have &longs;unk into
torpor, my pul&longs;e throbs, and my hairs upri&longs;e: my
brows are knit, as then; and I gaze around me in
di&longs;traction. I was unconquerably aver&longs;e to death;
but death, imminent and full of agony as that which
was threatened, was nothing. This was not the
only or chief in&longs;pirer of my fears.
For him, not for my&longs;elf, was my &longs;oul tormented.
I might die, and no crime, &longs;urpa&longs;&longs;ing the reach of
mercy, would pur&longs;ue me to the pre&longs;ence of my
Judge; but my a&longs;&longs;a&longs;&longs;in would &longs;urvive to contemplate
his deed, and that a&longs;&longs;a&longs;&longs;in was Wieland!
Wings to bear me beyond his reach I had not.
I could not vani&longs;h with a thought. The door was
open, but my murderer was interpo&longs;ed between that
and me. Of &longs;elf-defence I was incapable. The




phrenzy that lately prompted me to blood was gone;
my &longs;tate was de&longs;perate; my re&longs;cue was impo&longs;&longs;ible.
The weight of the&longs;e accumulated thoughts could
not be borne. My &longs;ight became confu&longs;ed; my
limbs were &longs;eized with convul&longs;ion; I &longs;poke, but my
words were half-formed:—
“Spare me, my brother! Look down, righteous
Judge! &longs;natch me from this fate! take away
this fury from him, or turn it el&longs;ewhere!”
Such was the agony of my thoughts, that I noticed
not &longs;teps entering my apartment. Supplicating
eyes were ca&longs;t upward, but when my prayer was
breathed, I once more wildly gazed at the door. A
form met my &longs;ight: I &longs;huddered as if the God whom
I invoked were pre&longs;ent. It was Carwin that again
intruded, and who &longs;tood before me, erect in attitude,
and &longs;tedfa&longs;t in look!
The &longs;ight of him awakened new and rapid
thoughts. His recent tale was remembered: his
magical tran&longs;itions and my&longs;terious energy of voice:
Whether he were infernal or miraculous, or human,
there was no power and no need to decide.
Whether the contriver or not of this &longs;pell, he was
able to unbind it, and to check the fury of my brother.
He had a&longs;cribed to him&longs;elf intentions not malignant.
Here now was afforded a te&longs;t of his truth.
Let him interpo&longs;e, as from above; revoke the &longs;avage
decree which the madne&longs;s of Wieland has a&longs;&longs;igned
to heaven, and extingui&longs;h for ever this pa&longs;&longs;ion for
blood!
My mind detected at a glance this avenue to
&longs;afety. The recommendations it po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;ed thronged
as it were together, and made but one impression
on my intellect. Remoter effects and collateral
dangers I &longs;aw not. Perhaps the pau&longs;e of an





in&longs;tant had &longs;ufficed to call them up. The improbability
that the influence which governed Wieland
was external or human; the tendency of this stratagem
to &longs;anction &longs;o fatal an error, or &longs;ub&longs;titute
a more de&longs;tructive rage in place of this; the sufficiency
of Carwin's mere mu&longs;cular forces to counteract
the efforts, and re&longs;train the fury of Wieland,
might, at a &longs;econd glance, have been di&longs;covered;
but no &longs;econd glance was allowed. My fir&longs;t thought
hurried me to action, and, fixing my eyes upon Carwin
I exclaimed—
“O wretch! once more ha&longs;t thou come? Let
it be to abjure thy malice; to counterwork this
helli&longs;h &longs;tratagem; to turn from me and from my
brother, this de&longs;olating rage!
“Te&longs;tify thy innocence or thy remor&longs;e: exert
the powers which pertain to thee, whatever they
be, to turn a&longs;ide this ruin. Thou art the author
of the&longs;e horrors! What have I done to de&longs;erve thus
to die? How have I merited this unrelenting persecution?
I adjure thee, by that God who&longs;e voice
thou ha&longs;t dared to counterfeit, to &longs;ave my life!
“Wilt thou then go? leave me! Succourle&longs;s!”
Carwin li&longs;tened to my intreaties unmoved, and
turned from me. He &longs;eemed to he&longs;itate a moment:
then glided through the door. Rage and de&longs;pair
&longs;tifled my utterance. The interval of re&longs;pite was
pa&longs;&longs;ed; the pangs re&longs;erved for me by Wieland,
were not to be endured; my thoughts ru&longs;hed again
into anarchy. Having received the knife from his
hand, I held it loo&longs;ely and without regard; but now
it &longs;eized again my attention; and I gra&longs;ped it with
force.
He &longs;eemed to notice not the entrance or exit of
Carwin. My ge&longs;ture and the murderous weapon
appeared to have e&longs;caped his notice. His &longs;ilence




was unbroken; his eye, fixed upon the clock for
a time, was now withdrawn; fury kindled in every
feature; all that was human in his face gave way
to an expre&longs;&longs;ion &longs;upernatural and tremendous. I
felt my left arm within his gra&longs;p.—
Even now I he&longs;itated to &longs;trike. I &longs;hrunk from
his a&longs;&longs;ault, but in vain.—
Here let me de&longs;i&longs;t. Why &longs;hould I re&longs;cue this
event from oblivion? Why &longs;hould I paint this detestable
conflict? Why not terminate at once this
&longs;eries of horrors?—Hurry to the verge of the precipice,
and ca&longs;t my&longs;elf for ever beyond remembrance
and beyond hope?
Still I live: with this load upon my brea&longs;t; with
this phantom to pur&longs;ue my &longs;teps; with adders
lodged in my bo&longs;om, and &longs;tinging me to madne&longs;s:
&longs;till I con&longs;ent to live!
Yes, I will ri&longs;e above the &longs;phere of mortal passions:
I will &longs;purn at the cowardly remor&longs;e that
bids me &longs;eek impunity in &longs;ilence, or comfort in forgetfulness.
My nerves &longs;hall be new &longs;trung to the
ta&longs;k. Have I not re&longs;olved? I will die. The
gulph before me is inevitable and near. I will die,
but then only when my tale is at an end.
