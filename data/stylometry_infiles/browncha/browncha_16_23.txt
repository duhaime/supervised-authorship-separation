Will you wonder that I read no farther?
Will you not rather be a&longs;toni&longs;hed that I read thus
far? What power &longs;upported me through &longs;uch a
ta&longs;k I know not. Perhaps the doubt from which
I could not di&longs;engage my mind, that the &longs;cene here
depicted was a dream, contributed to my perseverance.
In vain the &longs;olemn introduction of my uncle,
his appeals to my fortitude, and allu&longs;ions to
&longs;omething mon&longs;trous in the events he was about to
di&longs;clo&longs;e; in vain the di&longs;tre&longs;sful perplexity, the mysterious
&longs;ilence and ambiguous an&longs;wers of my attendants,
e&longs;pecially when the condition of my brother
was the theme of my inquiries, were remembered.
I recalled the interview with Wieland in my chamber,
his preternatural tranquillity &longs;ucceeded by bur&longs;ts
of pa&longs;&longs;ion and menacing actions. All the&longs;e coincided
with the tenor of this paper.
Catharine and her children, and Loui&longs;a were
dead. The act that de&longs;troyed them was, in the
highe&longs;t degree, inhuman. It was worthy of savages
trained to murder, and exulting in agonies.
Who was the performer of the deed? Wieland!
My brother! The hu&longs;band and the father! That
man of gentle virtues and invincible benignity!
placable and mild—an idolator of peace! Surely,
&longs;aid I, it is a dream. For many days have I been
vexed with frenzy. Its dominion is &longs;till felt; but
new forms are called up to diver&longs;ify and augment
my torments.






The paper dropped from my hand, and my eyes
followed it. I &longs;hrunk back, as if to avoid &longs;ome
petrifying influence that approached me. My
tongue was mute; all the functions of nature were
at a &longs;tand, and I &longs;unk upon the floor lifele&longs;s.
The noi&longs;e of my fall, as I afterwards heard,
alarmed my uncle, who was in a lower apartment,
and who&longs;e apprehen&longs;ions had detained him. He
ha&longs;tened to my chamber, and admini&longs;tered the assistance
which my condition required. When I
opened my eyes I beheld him before me. His &longs;kill
as a rea&longs;oner as well as a phy&longs;ician, was exerted
to obviate the injurious effects of this di&longs;clo&longs;ure;
but he had wrongly e&longs;timated the &longs;trength of my
body or of my mind. This new &longs;hock brought me
once more to the brink of the grave, and my malady
was much more difficult to &longs;ubdue than at
fir&longs;t.
I will not dwell upon the long train of dreary
&longs;en&longs;ations, and the hideous confu&longs;ion of my understanding.
Time &longs;lowly re&longs;tored its cu&longs;tomary firmness
to my frame, and order to my thoughts. The
images impre&longs;&longs;ed upon my mind by this fatal paper
were &longs;omewhat effaced by my malady. They were
ob&longs;cure and disjointed like the parts of a dream. I
was de&longs;irous of freeing my imagination from this
chaos. For this end I que&longs;tioned my uncle, who
was my con&longs;tant companion. He was intimidated
by the i&longs;&longs;ue of his fir&longs;t experiment, and took pains
to elude or di&longs;courage my inquiry. My impetuosity
&longs;ome times compelled him to have re&longs;ort to
mi&longs;repre&longs;entations and untruths.
Time effected that end, perhaps, in a more beneficial
manner. In the cour&longs;e of my meditations
the recollections of the pa&longs;t gradually became more
di&longs;tinct. I revolved them, however, in &longs;ilence,




and being no longer accompanied with &longs;urprize,
they did not exerci&longs;e a death-dealing power. I had
di&longs;continued the peru&longs;al of the paper in the mid&longs;t
of the narrative; but what I read, combined with
information el&longs;ewhere obtained, threw, perhaps, a
&longs;ufficient light upon the&longs;e dete&longs;table tran&longs;actions;
yet my curio&longs;ity was not inactive. I de&longs;ired to
peru&longs;e the remainder.
My eagerne&longs;s to know the particulars of this
tale was mingled and abated by my antipathy to the
&longs;cene which would be di&longs;clo&longs;ed. Hence I employed
no means to effect my purpo&longs;e. I de&longs;ired knowledge,
and, at the &longs;ame time, &longs;hrunk back from
receiving the boon.
One morning, being left alone, I ro&longs;e from my
bed, and went to a drawer where my finer clothing
u&longs;ed to be kept. I opened it, and this fatal paper
&longs;aluted my &longs;ight. I &longs;natched it involuntarily,
and withdrew to a chair. I debated, for a few minutes,
whether I &longs;hould open and read. Now that
my fortitude was put to trial, it failed. I felt myself
incapable of deliberately &longs;urveying a &longs;cene of
&longs;o much horror. I was prompted to return it to
its place, but this re&longs;olution gave way, and I determined
to peru&longs;e &longs;ome part of it. I turned over the
leaves till I came near the conclu&longs;ion. The narrative
of the criminal was fini&longs;hed. The verdict
of guilty reluctantly pronounced by the jury, and
the accu&longs;ed interrogated why &longs;entence of death
&longs;hould not pa&longs;s. The an&longs;wer was brief, &longs;olemn,
and emphatical.
“No. I have nothing to &longs;ay. My tale has been
told. My motives have been truly &longs;tated. If my
judges are unable to di&longs;cern the purity of my intentions,
or to credit the &longs;tatement of them, which I
have ju&longs;t made; if they &longs;ee not that my deed was




enjoined by heaven; that obedience was the te&longs;t of
perfect virtue, and the extinction of &longs;elfi&longs;hne&longs;s and
error, they mu&longs;t pronounce me a murderer.
“They refu&longs;e to credit my tale; they impute
my acts to the influence of dæmons; they account
me an example of the highe&longs;t wickedne&longs;s of which
human nature is capable; they doom me to death
and in&longs;amy. Have I power to e&longs;cape this evil?
If I have, be &longs;ure I will exert it. I will not accept
evil at their hand, when I am entitled to good; I
will &longs;uffer only when I cannot elude &longs;uffering.
“You &longs;ay that I am guilty. Impious and ra&longs;h!
thus to u&longs;urp the prerogatives of your Maker!
to &longs;et up your bounded views and halting rea&longs;on,
as the mea&longs;ure of truth!
“Thou, Omnipotent and Holy! Thou knowe&longs;t
that my actions were conformable to thy will. I
know not what is crime; what actions are evil
in their ultimate and comprehen&longs;ive tendency or
what are good. Thy knowledge, as thy power,
is unlimited. I have taken thee for my guide, and
cannot err. To the arms of thy protection, I entrust
my &longs;afety. In the awards of thy ju&longs;tice, I
confide for my recompen&longs;e.
“Come death when it will, I am &longs;afe. Let
calumuy and abhorrence pur&longs;ue me among men; I
&longs;hall not be defrauded of my dues. The peace of
virtue, and the glory of obedience, will be my portion
hereafter.”
Here ended the &longs;peaker. I withdrew my eyes
from the page; but before I had time to reflect on
what I had read, Mr. Cambridge entered the room.
He quickly perceived how I had been employed,
and betrayed &longs;ome &longs;olicitude re&longs;pecting the condition
of my mind.
His fears, however, were &longs;uperfluous. What I




had read, threw me into a &longs;tate not ea&longs;ily de&longs;cribed.
Angui&longs;h and fury, however, had no part in it. My
faculties were chained up in wonder and awe. Ju&longs;t
then, I was unable to &longs;peak. I looked at my friend
with an air of inqui&longs;itivene&longs;s, and pointed at the
roll. He comprehended my inquiry, and an&longs;wered
me with looks of gloomy acquie&longs;cence. After &longs;ome
time, my thoughts found their way to my lips.
Such then were the acts of my brother. Such
were his words. For this he was condemned to
die: To die upon the gallows! A fate, cruel and
unmerited! And is it &longs;o? continued I, &longs;truggling
for utterance, which this new idea made difficult;
is he—dead!
“No. He is alive. There could be no doubt
as to the cau&longs;e of the&longs;e exce&longs;&longs;es. They originated
in &longs;udden madne&longs;s; but that madne&longs;s continues, and
he is condemned to perpetual impri&longs;onment.”
“Madne&longs;s, &longs;ay you? Are you &longs;ure? Were
not the&longs;e &longs;ights, and the&longs;e &longs;ounds, really &longs;een and
heard?”
My uncle was &longs;urprized at my que&longs;tion. He
looked at me with apparent inquietude. “Can
you doubt,” &longs;aid he, “that the&longs;e were illu&longs;ions?
Does heaven, think you, interfere for &longs;uch ends?”
“O no; I think it not. Heaven cannot stimulate
to &longs;uch unheard-of outrage. The agent was
not good, but evil.”
“Nay, my dear girl,” &longs;aid my friend, “lay
a&longs;ide the&longs;e fancies. Neither angel nor devil had
any part in this affair.”
“You mi&longs;under&longs;tand me,” I an&longs;wered; “I believe
the agency to be external and real, but not
&longs;upernatural.”
“Indeed!” &longs;aid he, in an accent of &longs;urprize.
“Whom do you then &longs;uppo&longs;e to be the agent?”







“I know not. All is wildering conjecture. I
cannot forget Carwin. I cannot bani&longs;h the suspicion
that he was the &longs;etter of the&longs;e &longs;nares. But how
can we &longs;uppo&longs;e it to be madne&longs;s? Did in&longs;anity
ever before a&longs;&longs;ume this form?”
“Frequently. The illu&longs;ion, in this ca&longs;e, was
more dreadful in its con&longs;equences, than any that
has come to my knowledge; but, I repeat that
&longs;imilar illu&longs;ions are not rare. Did you never hear
of an in&longs;tance which occurred in your mother's
family?”
“No. I be&longs;eech you relate it. My grandfather's
death I have under&longs;tood to have been extraordinary,
but I know not in what re&longs;pect. A brother,
to whom he was much attached, died in his
youth, and this, as I have heard, influenced, in &longs;ome
remarkable way, the fate of my grandfather; but I
am unacquainted with particulars.”
“On the death of that brother,” re&longs;umed my
friend, “my father was &longs;eized with dejection,
which was found to flow from two &longs;ources. He
not only grieved for the lo&longs;s of a friend, but entertained
the belief that his own death would be inevitably
con&longs;equent on that of his brother. He
waited from day to day in expectation of the &longs;troke
which he predicted was &longs;peedily to fall upon him.
Gradually, however, he recovered his cheerfulne&longs;s
and confidence. He married, and performed his
part in the world with &longs;pirit and activity. At the
end of twenty-one years it happened that he &longs;pent
the &longs;ummer with his family at an hou&longs;e which he
po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;ed on the &longs;ea coa&longs;t in Cornwall. It was at
no great di&longs;tance from a cliff which overhung
the ocean, and ro&longs;e into the air to a great height.
The &longs;ummit was level and &longs;ecure, and ea&longs;ily ascended
on the land &longs;ide. The company frequently




repaired hither in clear weather, invited by its pure
airs and exten&longs;ive pro&longs;pects. One evening in June
my father, with his wife and &longs;ome friends, chanced
to be on this &longs;pot. Every one was happy, and
my father's imagination &longs;eemed particularly alive
to the grandeur of the &longs;cenery.
“Suddenly, however, his limbs trembled and his
features betrayed alarm. He threw him&longs;elf into
the attitude of one li&longs;tening. He gazed earne&longs;tly
in a direction in which nothing was vi&longs;ible to his
friends. This la&longs;ted for a minute; then turning
to his companions, he told them that his brother
had ju&longs;t delivered to him a &longs;ummons, which mu&longs;t
be in&longs;tantly obeyed. He then took an ha&longs;ty and
&longs;olemn leave of each per&longs;on, and, before their surprize
would allow them to under&longs;tand the &longs;cene,
he ru&longs;hed to the edge of the cliff, threw him&longs;elf
headlong, and was &longs;een no more.
“In the cour&longs;e of my practice in the German
army, many ca&longs;es, equally remarkable, have occurred,
Unque&longs;tionably the illu&longs;ions were maniacal,
though the vulgar thought otherwi&longs;e. They
are all reducible to one cla&longs;s, * and are not more difficult
of explication and cure than mo&longs;t affections
of our frame.”
This opinion my uncle endeavoured, by various
means, to impre&longs;s upon me. I li&longs;tened to his reasonings
and illu&longs;trations with &longs;ilent re&longs;pect. My astonishment
was great on finding proofs of an influence
of which I had &longs;uppo&longs;ed there were no examples;
but I was far from accounting for appearances
in my uncle's manner. Ideas thronged into my
mind which I was unable to disjoin or to regulate.




I reflected that this madne&longs;s, if madne&longs;s it were,
had affected Pleyel and my&longs;elf as well as Wieland,
Pleyel had heard a my&longs;terious voice. I had &longs;een
and heard. A form had &longs;howed it&longs;elf to me as
well as to Wieland. The di&longs;clo&longs;ure had been made
in the &longs;ame &longs;pot. The appearance was equally
complete and equally prodigious in both in&longs;tances.
Whatever &longs;uppo&longs;ition I &longs;hould adopt, had I not
equal rea&longs;on to tremble? What was my &longs;ecurity
again&longs;t influences equally terrific and equally irresistable?

It would be vain to attempt to de&longs;cribe the &longs;tate
of mind which this idea produced. I wondered at
the change which a moment had affected in my brother's
condition. Now was I &longs;tupified with tenfold
wonder in contemplating my&longs;elf. Was I not
likewi&longs;e transformed from rational and human into
a creature of namele&longs;s and fearful attributes? Was
I not tran&longs;ported to the brink of the &longs;ame aby&longs;s?
Ere a new day &longs;hould come, my hands might be
embrued in blood, and my remaining life be consigned
to a dungeon and chains.
With moral &longs;en&longs;ibility like mine, no wonder that
this new dread was more in&longs;upportable than the
angui&longs;h I had lately endured. Grief carries its own
antidote along with it. When thought becomes
merely a vehicle of pain, its progre&longs;s mu&longs;t be stopped.
Death is a cure which nature or our&longs;elves
mu&longs;t admini&longs;ter: To this cure I now looked forward
with gloomy &longs;atisfaction.
My &longs;ilence could not conceal from my uncle the
&longs;tate of my thoughts. He made unwearied efforts
to divert my attention from views &longs;o pregnant with
danger. His efforts, aided by time, were in &longs;ome
mea&longs;ure &longs;ucce&longs;sful. Confidence in the &longs;trength of
my re&longs;olution, and in the healthful &longs;tate of my




faculties, was once more revived. I was able to devote
my thoughts to my brother's &longs;tate, and the
cau&longs;es of this di&longs;a&longs;terous proceeding.
My opinions were the &longs;port of eternal change.
Some times I conceived the apparition to be more
than human. I had no grounds on which to build
a di&longs;belief. I could not deny faith to the evidence
of my religion; the te&longs;timony of men was loud and
unanimous: both the&longs;e concurred to per&longs;uade me
that evil &longs;pirits exi&longs;ted, and that their energy was
frequently exerted in the &longs;y&longs;tem of the world.
The&longs;e ideas connected them&longs;elves with the image
of Carwin. Where is the proof, &longs;aid I, that
dæmons may not be &longs;ubjected to the controul of
men? This truth may be di&longs;torted and deba&longs;ed in
the minds of the ignorant. The dogmas of the
vulgar, with regard to this &longs;ubject, are glaringly
ab&longs;urd; but though the&longs;e may ju&longs;tly be neglected
by the wife, we are &longs;carcely ju&longs;tified in totally rejecting
the po&longs;&longs;ibility that men may obtain supernatural
aid.
The dreams of &longs;uper&longs;tition are worthy of contempt.
Witchcraft, its in&longs;truments and miracles,
the compact ratified by a bloody &longs;ignature, the apparatus
of &longs;ulpherous &longs;mells and thundering explosions,
are mon&longs;trous and chimerical. The&longs;e
have no part in the &longs;cene over which the genius of
Carwin pre&longs;ides. That con&longs;cious beings, di&longs;&longs;imilar
from human, but moral and voluntary agents as we
are, &longs;ome where exi&longs;t, can &longs;carcely be denied. That
their aid may be employed to benign or malignant
purpo&longs;es, cannot be di&longs;proved.
Darkne&longs;s re&longs;ts upon the de&longs;igns of this man.
The extent of his power is unknown; but is there
not evidence that it has been now exerted?
I recurred to my own experience. Here





Carwin had actually appeared upon the &longs;tage; but this
was in a human character. A voice and a form
were di&longs;covered; but one was apparently exerted,
and the other di&longs;clo&longs;ed, not to befriend, but to counteract
Carwin's de&longs;igns. There were tokens of
ho&longs;tility, and not of alliance, between them. Carwin
was the mi&longs;creant who&longs;e projects were re&longs;i&longs;ted
by a mini&longs;ter of heaven. How can this be reconciled
to the &longs;tratagem which ruined my brother?
There the agency was at once preternatural and
malignant.
The recollection of this fact led my thoughts into
a new channel. The malignity of that influence
which governed my brother had hitherto been no
&longs;ubject of doubt. His wife and children were destroyed;
they had expired in agony and fear; yet
was it indi&longs;putably certain that their murderer was
criminal? He was acquitted at the tribunal of his
own con&longs;cience; his behaviour at his trial and &longs;ince,
was faithfully reported to me; appearances were
uniform; not for a moment did he lay a&longs;ide the
maje&longs;ty of virtue; he repelled all invectives by appealing
to the deity, and to the tenor of his pa&longs;t life;
&longs;urely there was truth in this appeal: none but a
command from heaven could have &longs;wayed his will;
and nothing but unerring proof of divine approbation
could &longs;u&longs;tain his mind in its pre&longs;ent elevation.
