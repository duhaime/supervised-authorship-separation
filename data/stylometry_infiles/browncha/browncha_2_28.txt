TO MARY WILMOT.
Philadelphia, May 14.






I am impatient to see you, and assure
myself from your own lips, of your welfare;
but there is a necessity for postponing my
visit till to-morrow evening. Then I will see
you; meanwhile, read the inclosed papers.
One is a narrative of occurrences since the
date of my last letter to you from Hatfield.
The rest are letters that have been written to
miss Howard, or received from her, down to
the present hour. Read them, and reflect
deeply and impartially on their contents. They
require no preface or commentary. Make up
your mind by evening, when I will attend you
with an heart overflowing with the affection of




a friend, and prepared to perform, with zeal
and cheerfulness, whatever the cause of your
felicity requires from

E. H.
