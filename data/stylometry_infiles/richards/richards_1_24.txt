Miss Clarissa Harlowe, To Miss Howe. 

Sunday Morning, March 5. 
Hannah has just brought me, from the private
place in the garden-wall, a Letter from
Mr. Lovelace, deposited last night, signed also by
Lord M. 
He tells me in it, ‘That Mr. Solmes makes it his
boast, that he is to be married in a few days to one
of the shyest women in England: That my Brother
explains his meaning; This shy creature, he
says, is me; and he assures every one, that his
younger Sister is very soon to be Mr. Solme's Wife. 
He tells me of the patterns bespoken which my
Mother mentioned to me.’ 
Not one thing escapes him that is done or said in
this house. 
‘My Sister, he says, reports the same things; and
that with such particular aggravations of insult upon
him, that he cannot but be extremely piqued, as
well at the manner, as from the occasion; and expresses
himself with great violence upon it. 
‘He knows not, he says, what my Relations inducements
can be, to prefer such a man as Solmes
to him. If advantageous Settlements be the motive,
Solmes shall not offer what he will refuse to comply
with. 
‘As to his Estate, and Family; the first cannot be
excepted against: And for the second, he will not
disgrace himself by a comparison so odious. He
appeals to Lord M. for the regularity of his life and
manners ever since he has made his addresses to me,
or had hope of my favour.’ 
I suppose, he would have his Lordship's signing to
this Letter to be taken as a voucher for him. 
‘He desires my leave (in company with my Lord, 

in a pacific manner) to attend my Father or Uncles,
in order to make proposals that must be accepted, if
they will but see him, and hear what they are: And
tells me, that he will submit to any measures that
I shall prescribe, in order to bring about a Reconciliation.’ 
He presumes to be very earnest with me, ‘to give
him a private meeting some night, in my Father's
garden, attended by whom I please.’ 
Really, my dear, were you to see his Letter, you
would think I had given him great encouragement,
and that I am in direct treaty with him; or that he is
sure that my friends will drive me into a foreign protection; 
for he has the boldness to offer, in my Lord's
name, an asylum to me, should I be tyrannically
treated in Solmes's behalf. 
I suppose it is the way of this Sex to endeavour to
entangle the thoughtless of ours by bold supposals
and offers, in hopes that we shall be too complaisant
or bashful to quarrel with them; and, if not checked,
to reckon upon our silence, as assents voluntarily
given, or concessions made in their favour. 
There are other particulars in this Letter which I
ought to mention to you: But I will take an opportunity
to send you the Letter itself, or a Copy of it. 
For my own part, I am very uneasy to think how
I have been drawn on one hand, and driven on the
other, into a clandestine, in short, into a mere Lover-like
correspondence, which my heart condemns. 
It is easy to see, if I do not break it off, that Mr.
Lovelace's advantages, by reason of my unhappy situation,
will every day encrease, and I shall be more and
more entangled. Yet if I do put an end to it, without
making it a condition of being freed from Mr. Solmes's
address—May I, my dear, is it best to continue it a little
longer, in hopes to extricate myself out of the other
difficulty, by giving up all thoughts of Mr. Lovelace? — 
Whose advice can I now ask but yours? 

All my Relations are met. They are at breakfast
together. Mr. Solmes is expected. I am excessively
uneasy. I must lay down my pen. 
* *
They are all going to church together. Grievously
disordered they appear to be, as Hannah tells me. She
believes something is resolved upon. 
Sunday Noon. 
What a cruel thing is suspense! —I will ask leave
to go to church this afternoon. I expect to be denied: 
But if I do not ask, they may allege, that my not going
is owing to myself. 
* *
I desired to speak with Shorey. Shorey came. 
I directed her to carry to my Mother my request for
permission to go to church this afternoon. What
think you was the return? Tell her, that she must
direct herself to her Brother for any favour she has to
ask. —So, my dear, I am to be delivered up to my
Brother! 
I was resolved, however, to ask of him this favour. 
Accordingly, when they sent me up my solitary dinner,
I gave the messenger a billet, in which I made it
my humble request thro' him to my Father, to be permitted
to go to church this afternoon. 
This was the contemptuous answer: “Tell her,
that her request will be taken into consideration tomorrow.” 
—My request to go to church to-day to
be taken into consideration to-morrow! 
Patience will be the fittest return I can make to
such an insult. But this method will not do with me; 
indeed it will not! And yet it is but the beginning,
I suppose, of what I am to expect from my Brother,
now I am delivered up to him. 
* *
On recollection, I thought it best to renew my request. 
I did. The following is a copy of what I wrote,
and what follows that, of the Answer sent me. 


Sir,
I know not what to make of the answer brought
to my request of being permitted to go to church
this afternoon. If you designed to shew your pleasantry
by it, I hope that will continue; and then my
request will be granted. 
You know, that I never absented myself, when
well, and at home, till the two last Sundays; when I
was advised not to go. My present situation is such,
that I never more wanted the benefit of the public
prayers. 
I will solemnly engage only to go thither, and back
again. 
I hope it cannot be thought that I would do otherwise. 
My dejection of spirits will give a too just excuse on
the score of indisposition, for avoiding visits. Nor will
I, but by distant civilities, return the compliments of
any of my acquaintance. My disgraces, if they are
to have an end, need not to be proclaimed to the
whole world. I ask this favour, therefore, for my
reputation's sake, that I may be able to hold up my
head in the neighbourhood, if I live to see an end of
the unmerited severities which seem to be designed
for 
Your unhappy Sister,
Cl. Harlowe. 

To Miss Clarissa Harlowe.
For a girl to lay so much stress upon going to
church, and yet resolve to defy her Parents, in
an article of the greatest consequence to them, and
to the whole family, is an absurdity. You are recommended,
Miss, to the practice of your private
devotions. May they be efficacious upon the mind
of one of the most pervicacious young creatures that
ever was heard of! The intention is, I tell you plainly,
to mortify you into a sense of your duty. The 

neighbours you are so solicitous to appear well with,
already know, that you defy that. So, Miss, if you
have a real value for your reputation, shew it as you
ought. It is yet in your own power to establish or
impair it. 
Ja. Harlowe. 
Thus, my dear Miss Howe, has my Brother got
me into his snares; and I, like a poor silly bird, the
more I struggle, am the more entangled.
