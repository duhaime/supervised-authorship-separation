Miss Byron. In Continuation. 


Thursday, June 1.
Thanks an hundred times repeated, to you, my
dear Lady G. and to good Dr. Bartlett, for the
favour of Sir Charles's Letters, of May 22. 23. 26.
and 27. N. S. all following so quick, that which
you favour'd me with of the 10th-21st, upon which I
wrote to you yesterday. I dispatch them to you
for the Doctor, all together. 
I cannot, my dear, have much to say to the contents
of these. 
They have met: Had more interviews than one. 
Why cannot the Count of Belvedere—But no more
of that. I don't like this General. The whole family
(the two noble sufferers Jeronymo and Clementina
excepted) seem to me to have more pride than gratitude
—Ay, mother and all, my dear! 
But you see Sir Charles has been indisposed. No
wonder. Visited by the Marquis and Marchioness,
you see: Not a slight illness, therefore, you may believe. 
God preserve him, and restore Lady Clementina,
and the worthy Jeronymo! 
His kind remembrance of me—But, my dear,
I think the Doctor and you must forbear obliging me
with any more of his Letters—His goodness, his tenderness,
his delicacy, his strict honour, but adds—Yet
can any new instances add to a character so uniformly
good? —But the chief reason of my self-denial, if you
were to take me at my word, as to these communications,
is, that his affecting descriptions and narratives 

of Lady Clementina's resveries (poor, poor Lady!)
will break my heart! Yet you must send them to 
Your ever obliged
Harriet Byron.
