Mr. Lovelace, To John Belford, Esq; 

A letter is put into my hands by Wilson himself— 
Such a letter!— 
A letter from Miss Howe to her cruel friend!— 
I made no scruple to open it. 
It is a miracle, that I fell not into fits at the reading
of it; and at the thought of what might have been
the consequence, had it come to the hands of this Clarissa
Harlowe. Let my justly-excited rage excuse my
irreverence. 
Collins, tho' not his day, brought it this afternoon
to Wilson's, with a particular desire, that it might be
sent with all speed to Miss Beaumont's lodgings, and
given, if possible, into her own hands. He had before
been here (at Mrs. Sinclair's), with intent to deliver it
to her himself; but was told [too truly told!], that she
was abroad; but that they would give her any thing
he should leave for her, the moment she returned. — 
But he cared not to trust them with his business, and
went away to Wilson's (as I find by the description of
him at both places), and there left the letter; but not
till he had a second time called here, and found her not
come in. 
The letter (which I shall inclose; for it is too long
to transcribe) will account to thee for his coming
hither. 
O this devilish Miss Howe! —Something must be
resolved upon, and done with that little Fury! 
* *
Thou wilt see the margin of this cursed letter
crouded with indices [&rhand;]. I put them to mark the 

places devoted for vengeance, or requiring animadversion. 
Return thou it to me the moment thou hast
read it. 
Read it here; and avoid trembling for me, if thou
canst. 

To Miss Lætitia Beaumont.
Wednesday, June 7. 
My dearest Friend,
You will perhaps think, that I have been too
long silent.  But I had begun two letters at
different times since my last, and written a great
deal each time; and with spirit enough, I assure
you; incensed as I was against the abominable
wretch you are with; particularly on reading
yours of the 21st of the past month (a) . 
 The first I intended to keep open till I could
give you some account of my proceedings with
Mrs. Townsend.  It was some days before I saw
her: And this intervenient space giving me time
to re-peruse what I had written, I thought it proper
to lay that aside, and to write in a stile a little
less fervent; for you would have blamed me, I
know, for the freedom of some of my expressions
(execrations, if you please).  And when I had
gone a good way in the second, the change in your
prospects, on his communicating to you Miss
Montague's letter, and his better behaviour, occasioning
a change in your mind, I laid that aside
also. And in this uncertainty, thought I would
wait to see the issue of affairs between you, before
I wrote again; believing that all would soon be
decided one way or other. 
I had still, perhaps, held this resolution (as every
appearance, according to your letters, was more
and more promising), had not the two passed days 

furnished me with intelligence which it highly
imports you to know. 
 But I must stop here, and take a little walk, to
try to keep down that just indignation which rises
to my pen, when I am about to relate to you what
I must communicate. 
* *
I am not my own mistress enough—Then my
mother—Always up and down—And watching
as if I were writing to a fellow— But I will try
if I can contain myself in tolerable bounds.— 
The women of the house where you are—O
my dear—The women of the house—But you
never thought highly of them—So it cannot be
so very surprizing— Nor would you have staid so
long with them; had not the notion of removing
to one of your own, made you less uneasy, and
less curious about their characters, and behaviour. 
 Yet I could now wish, that you had been less reserved
among them—But I teaze you—In short,
my dear, you are certainly in a devilish house! — 
 Be assured, that the woman is one of the vilest of
women! —Nor does she go to you by her right
name—Very true—Her name is not Sinclair— 
Nor is the street she lives in Dover-street. —Did
you never go out by yourself, and discharge the
coach or chair, and return by another coach or
chair?  If you did (yet I don't remember that you
ever wrote to me, that you did), you would never
have found your way to the vile house, either by
the woman's name, Sinclair, or by the street's
name, mentioned by that Doleman in his letter
about the lodgings (a) . 
The wretch might indeed have held out these
false lights a little more excusably, had the house
been an honest house; and had his end only been to
prevent mischief from your brother—But this contrivance 

was antecedent, as I think, to your brother's
project: So that no excuse can be made for
his intentions at the time— The man, whatever he
may now intend, was certainly then, even then, a
villain in his heart! 
* *
I am excessively concerned, that I should be
prevailed upon, between your over-niceness, on
one hand, and my mother's positiveness, on the
other, to be satisfied without knowing how to
direct to you at your lodgings. I think too, that
the proposal that I should be put off to a third-hand
knowlege, or rather veiled in a first-hand
ignorance, came from him—and that it was only
acquiesced in by you, as it was by me (a) , upon
needless and weak considerations—Because, truly,
I might have it to say, if challenged, that I knew
not where to send to you! —I am ashamed of myself! 
 —Had this been at first excusable, it could
not be a good reason for going on in the folly,
when you had no liking to the house, and when
he began to play tricks, and delay with you. — 
What! I was to mistrust myself, was I?  —I was
to allow it to be thought, that I could not keep
my own secret?  —But the house to be taken at
this time, and at that time, led us both on—like
fools, like tame fools in a string.  —Upon my
life, my dear, this man is a vile, a contemptible
villain—I must speak out! —How has he laughed 

in his sleeve at us both, I warrant, for I can't
tell how long! 
 And yet who could have thought, that a man
of fortune, and some reputation [This Doleman, I
mean; not your wretch, to be sure!]—formerly
a Rake indeed—[I have inquired after him—long
ago; and so was the easier satisfied]—but married
to a woman of family—having had a palsy-blow
—and one would think a penitent—should
recommend such a house— [Why, my dear, he
could not inquire of it, but must find it to be bad]
—to such a man as Lovelace, to bring his future,
nay, his then supposed bride, to? 
* *
I write, perhaps, with too much violence,
to be clear. But I cannot help it. Yet I lay
down my pen, and take it up every ten minutes,
in order to write with some temper—My mother
too in and out— What need I (she asks me) lock
myself in, if I am only reading past correspondencies?
—for that is my pretence, when she comes
poking in with her face sharpened to an edge, as
I may say, by a curiosity that gives her more pain
than pleasure— The Lord forgive me; but I believe
I shall huff her next time she comes in. 
* *
Do You forgive me too, my dear. My mother
ought; because she says, I am my father's girl; 
and because I am sure I am hers.  I don't know
what to do—I don't know what to write next—I
have so much to write, yet have so little patience,
and so little opportunity. 
But I will tell you how I came by my intelligence. 
 That being a fact, and requiring the less attention,
I will try to account to you for that. 
Thus then it came about—‘Miss Lardner
(whom you have seen at her cousin Biddulph's) 

saw you at St. James's church on Sunday was
fortnight. She kept you in her eye during the
whole time; but could not once obtain the notice
of yours, tho' she courtesy'd to you twice. 
She thought to pay her compliments to you
when the Service was over; for she doubted not
but you were married—and for an odd reason— 
because you came to church by yourself.  —Every
eye, as usual, she said, was upon you; and this
seeming to give you hurry, and you being nearer
the door than she, you slid out, before she could
get to you. But she ordered her servant to follow
you till you were housed. This servant saw
you step into a chair, which waited for you; 
and you ordered the men to carry you to the
place where they took you up. 
‘The next day, Miss Lardner sent the same
servant, out of mere curiosity, to make private
inquiry whether Mr. Lovelace were, or were
not, with you there.  And this inquiry brought
out, from different people, that the house was
suspected to be one of those genteel wicked
houses, which receive and accommodate fashionable
people of both sexes. 
‘Miss Lardner, confounded at this strange intelligence,
made further inquiry; injoining secrecy
to the servant she had sent, as well as to
the gentleman whom she employed:  Who had
it confirmed from a rakish friend, who knew
the house; and told him, that there were two
houses; the one, in which all decent appearances
were preserved, and guests rarely admitted; 
the other, the receptacle of those who
were absolutely engaged, and broken to the vile
yoke.’— 
Say—my dear creature-say-Shall I not execrate
the wretch? —But words are weak-What can I say,
that will suitably express my abhorrence of such 

a villain as he must have been, when he meditated
to bring a Clarissa Harlowe to such a place! 
‘Miss Lardner kept this to herself some days,
not knowing what to do; for she loves you, and
admires you of all women. At last, she revealed
it, but in confidence, to Miss Biddulph, by
letter. Miss Biddulph, in like confidence, being
afraid it would distract me, were I to know
it, communicated it to Miss Lloyd; and so, like
a whisper'd scandal, it passed through several
canals; and then it came to me. Which was
not till last Monday.’ 
I thought I should have fainted upon the surprising
communication. But rage taking place, it
blew away the sudden illness.  I besought Miss
Lloyd to re-injoin secrecy to every-one. I told
her, that I would not for the world, that my mother,
or any of your family, should know it.  And
I instantly caused a trusty friend to make what inquiries
he could about Tomlinson. 
 I had thoughts to have done it before: But not
imagining it to be needful, and little thinking that
you could be in such a house, and as you were pleased
with your changed prospects, I forbore.  And the
rather forbore, as the matter is so laid, that Mrs.
Hodges is supposed to know nothing of the projected
treaty of accommodation; but, on the
contrary, that it was designed to be a secret to her,
and to every-body but immediate parties; and it
was Mrs. Hodges that I had proposed to sound by
a second hand. 
 Now, my dear, it is certain, without applying
to that too-much favoured housekeeper, that there
is not such a man within ten miles of your Uncle. 
Very true! One Tomkins there is, about four miles
off; but he is a day-labourer: And one Thompson,
about five miles distant the other way; but he is
a parish schoolmaster, poor, and about seventy. 

 A man, tho' but of 800l. a year, cannot come
from one county to settle in another, but everybody
in both must know it, and talk of it. 
 Mrs. Hodges may yet be sounded at a distance,
if you will. Your uncle is an old man. Old
men imagine themselves under obligation to their
paramours, if younger than themselves, and seldom
keep anything from their knowlege.  But if
we suppose him to make a secret of the designed
treaty, it is impossible, before that treaty was
thought of, but she must have seen him, at least
have heard your uncle speak praisefully of a man
he is said to be so intimate with, let him have been
ever so little a while in those parts. 
 Yet, methinks, the story is so plausible.  Tomlinson,
as you describe him, is so good a man, and
so much of a gentleman; the end to be answered
by his being an impostor, so much more than necessary,
if Lovelace has villainy in his head; and
as you are in such a house— Your wretch's behaviour
to him was so petulant and lordly; and
Tomlinson's answer so full of spirit and circumstance; 
 and then what he communicated to you
of Mr. Hickman's application to your uncle, and
of Mrs. Norton's to your mother (some of which
particulars,  I am satisfied, his vile agent Joseph
Leman could not reveal to his viler employer); his
pressing on the marriage-day, in the name of your
uncle, which it could not answer any wicked purpose
for him to do; and what he writes of your
uncle's proposal,  to have it thought that you were
married from the time that you had lived in one
house together; and that to be made to agree with
the time of Mr. Hickman's visit to your uncle:  The insisting on a trusty person's being present at
the ceremony, at that uncle's nomination—These
things make me willing to try for a tolerable construction
to be made of all; tho' I am so much 

puzzled, by what occurs on both sides of the
question,  that I cannot but abhor the devilish
wretch,  whose inventions and contrivances are
for ever employing an inquisitive head, without
affording the means of absolute detection. 
But this is what I am ready to conjecture, that
Tomlinson, specious as he is, is a machine of
Lovelace; and that he is employed for some end,
which has not yet been answered.  —This is certain,
that not only Tomlinson, but Mennell, who,
I think, attended you more than once at this vile
house, must know it to be a vile house. 
What can you then think of Tomlinson's declaring
himself in favour of it, upon inquiry? 
Lovelace too must know it to be so; if not before
he brought you to it, soon after. 
 Perhaps the company he found there, may be
the most probable way of accounting for his bearing
with the house, and for his strange suspensions of
marriage, when it was in his power to call such
an angel of a woman his.— 
 O my dear, the man is a villain! the greatest
of villains, in every light! —I am convinced that
he is—And this Doleman must be another of his
implements! 
 There are so many wretches who think that to
be no sin, which is one of the greatest, and the
most ingrateful, of all sins; to ruin young creatures
of our sex, who place their confidence in them; that
the wonder is less than the shame, that people of
figure, of appearance, at least, are found to promote
the horrid purposes of profligates of fortune
and interest!— 
 But can I think (you will ask, with indignant
astonishment), that Lovelace can have designs upon
your honour? 
 That such designs he has had, if he still hold
them not, I can have no doubt, now that I know 

the house he has brought you to, to be a vile one. 
This is a clue that has led me to account for all
his behaviour to you ever since you have been in
his hands. 
Allow me a brief retrospection of it all. 
 We both know, that Pride, Revenge, and a delight
to tread in unbeaten paths, are principal ingredients
in the character of this finished libertine. 
 He hates all your family, yourself excepted; 
and I have several times thought, that I have seen
him stung and mortified, that Love has obliged
him to kneel at your footstool, because you are a
Harlowe.  —Yet is this wretch a Savage in Love. — 
Love that humanizes the fiercest spirits, has not
been able to subdue his.  His pride, and the credit
which a few plausible qualities, sprinkled
among his odious ones, have given him, have secured
him too good a reception from our eye-judging,
our undistinguishing, our self-flattering,
our too-confiding Sex, to make assiduity and obsequiousness,
and a conquest of his unruly passions,
any part of his study. 
 He has some reason for his animosity to all the
men, and to one woman of your family. He has
always shewn you, and all his own family too,
that he prefers his Pride to his Interest.  He is a
declared marriage-hater: A notorious intriguer: 
Full of his inventions; and glorying in them. — 
He never could draw you in to declarations of
Love: Nor, till your wise relations persecuted
you, as they did, to receive his addresses as a
Lover.  —He knew, that you professedly disliked
him for his immoralities; he could not therefore
justly blame you, for the coldness and indifference
of your behaviour to him. 
 The prevention of mischief was your first main
view in the correspondence he drew you into. 

He ought not, then, to have wonder'd, that you
declared your preference of the Single Life to any
matrimonial engagement. He knew, that this was
always your preference; and that before he tricked
you away so artfully.  What was his conduct to you
afterwards, that you should of a sudden change it? 
Thus was your whole behaviour regular, consistent,
and dutiful to those to whom, by birth, you
owed duty; and neither prudish, coquetish, nor
tyrannical to him. 
 He had agreed to go on with you upon those
your own terms, and to rely only on his own
merits and future reformation, for your favour. 
 It was plain to me, indeed, to whom you communicated
all that you knew of your own heart,
tho' not all of it that I found out, that Love had
pretty early gained footing in it. And this you
yourself would have discovered sooner than you
did,  had not his alarming, his unpolite, his rough
conduct, kept it under. 
 I knew, by experience, that Love is a fire that is
not to be played with, without burning one's fingers: 
I knew it to be a dangerous thing for two single
persons of different sexes, to enter into familiarity
and correspondence with each other; since, as to
the latter, must not a person be capable of premeditated
art, who can sit down to write, and not
write from the heart? —And a woman to write
her heart to a man practised in deceit, or even
to a man of some character, what advantage does
it give him over her? 
 As this man's vanity had made him imagine, that
no woman could be proof against Love, when
his address was honourable; no wonder that he
struggled, like a lion held in toils, against a passion
that he thought not returned. —And how
could you, at first, shew a return in love, to so
fierce a spirit, and who had seduced you away by 

vile artifices, but to the approval of those artifices? 
 Hence, perhaps, it is not difficult to believe,
that it became possible for such a wretch as this to
give way to his old prejudices against marriage; 
and to that Revenge which had always been a first
passion with him. 
This is the only way, I think, to account for
his horrid views in bringing you to a vile house. 
And now may not all the rest be naturally accounted
for?  —His delays—His teazing ways— 
His bringing you to bear with his lodging in the
same house—His making you pass to the people of
it, as his wife; tho' restrictively so, yet with
hope, no doubt (vilest of villains as he is!), to
take you at advantage.— 
 His bringing you into the company of his libertine
companions; The attempt of imposing
upon you that Miss Partington for a bedfellow,
very probably his own invention, for the worst of
purposes; His terrifying you at many different
times; His obtruding himself upon you when you
went out to church; no doubt to prevent your
finding out what the people were; The advantages
he made of your brother's foolish project with
Singleton. 
 See, my dear, how naturally all this follows
from the discovery made by Miss Lardner.  —See
how the monster, whom I thought, and so often
called, a fool, comes out to have been all the
time one of the greatest villains in the world! 
But if this be so, what (it would be asked by an
indifferent person) has hitherto saved you? Glorious
creature! —What (morally speaking) but
your watchfulness! What but That, and the majesty
of your virtue; the native dignity, which,
in a situation so very difficult (friendless, destitute, 

passing for a wife, cast into the company of creatures
accustomed to betray and ruin innocent
hearts) has hitherto enabled you to baffle, overawe,
and confound, such a dangerous libertine as
this; so habitually remorseless, as you have observed
him to be; so very various in his temper; 
so inventive; so seconded, so supported, so instigated,
too probably, as he has been! —That native
dignity, that heroism I will call it, which has,
on all proper occasions, exerted itself, in its full
lustre,  unmingled with that charming obligingness
and condescending sweetness, which is evermore
the softner of that dignity, when your mind
is free and unapprehensive! 
 Let me stop to admire, and to bless my beloved
friend, who, unhappily for herself, at an age
so tender, unacquainted as she was with the world,
and with the vile arts of libertines, having been
called upon to sustain the hardest and most shocking
trials, from persecuting Relations on one hand,
and from a villainous Lover on the other, has been
enabled to give such an illustrious example of
fortitude and prudence, as never woman gave
before her; and who, as I have heretofore observed
(a) , has made a far greater figure in adversity,
than she possibly could have made,  had
all her shining qualities been exerted in their full
force and power, by the continuance of that
prosperous run of fortune, which attended her for
Eighteen years of life out of Nineteen. 
* *
 But now, my dear, do I apprehend, that you
are in greater danger than ever yet you have been
in; if you are not married in a week; and yet
stay in this abominable house. For were you
out of it, I own, I should not be much afraid for
you. 

These are my thoughts, on the most deliberate
consideration:  ‘That he is now convinced, that
he has not been able to draw you off your
guard: That therefore, if he can obtain no
new advantage over you, as he goes along, he
is resolved to do you all the poor justice that it is
in the power of such a wretch as he, to do you. 
He is the rather induced to this, as he sees, that
all his own family have warmly engaged themselves
in your cause; and that it is his highest
interest to be just to you.  Then the horrid
wretch loves you, as well he may, above all
women. I have no doubt of this—With such a
love as such a wretch is capable of: With such
a love as Herod loved his Mariamne.  —He is now
therefore, very probably, at last, in earnest.’ 
I took time for inquiries of different natures, as
I knew by the train you are in, that whatever his
designs are, they cannot ripen either for good or
evil,  till something shall result from this new
device of his about Tomlinson and your uncle. 
Device I have no doubt that it is, whatever this
dark, this impenetrable spirit, intends by it. 
 And yet I find it to be true, that Counsellor
Williams (whom Mr. Hickman knows to be a
man of eminence in his profession) has actually
as good as finished the settlements:  That two
draughts of them have been made; one avowedly
to be sent to one Captain Tomlinson, as the clerk
says! —And I find, that a license has actually been
more than once endeavoured to be obtained; and
that difficulties have hitherto been made, equally
to Lovelace's vexation and disappointment.  My
mother's proctor, who is very intimate with the
proctor applied to by the wretch, has come at
this information in confidence; and hints, that, as
Mr. Lovelace is a man of high fortunes, these
difficulties will probably be got over. 

But here follow the causes of my apprehension
of your danger; which I should not have had a
thought of  (since nothing very vile has yet been
attempted) but on finding what a house you are
in, and, on that discovery, laying together, and
ruminating on past occurrences. 
 ‘You are obliged, from the present favourable
appearances, to give him your company whenever
he requests it. —You are under a necessity
of forgetting, or seeming to forget, past disobligations; 
and to receive his addresses as those of
a betrothed lover. —You will incur the censure
of prudery and affectation, even perhaps in your
own apprehension, if you keep him at that distance
which has hitherto been your security. — 
 His sudden (and as suddenly recovered) illness,
has given him an opportunity to find out, that
you love him. [Alas, my dear, I knew you loved
him!]  He is, as you relate, every hour more
and more an incroacher, upon it. He has seem'd
to change his nature, and is all love and gentleness. 
The wolf has put on the sheep's cloathing; 
yet more than once has shewn his teeth,
and his hardly sheathed claws.  The instance
you have given of his freedom with your person,
which you could not but resent; and yet, as
matters are circumstanced between you, could
not but pass over, when Tomlinson's letter
called you into his company (a) , shew the advantage
he has now over you;  and also, that if
he can obtain greater, he will. —And for this
very reason (as I apprehend) it is, that Tomlinson
is introduced; that is to say, to give you
the greater security,  and to be a mediator, if
mortal offence be given you, by any villainous
attempt. —The day seems not now to be so 

much in your power as it ought to be, since
That now partly depends on your uncle, whose
presence, at your own motion, he has wished
on the occasion. —A wish, were all real, very
unlikely, I think, to be granted.’ 
 And thus situated, should he offer greater freedoms,
must you not forgive him? 
I fear nothing (as I know who has said), that
devil carnate or incarnate can fairly do against a
virtue so established (a) — But surprizes, my dear,
in such a house as that you are in, and in such
circumstances as I have mentioned, I greatly
fear!  —The man, one, who has already triumphed
over persons worthy of his alliance. 
 What then have you to do, but to fly this
house, this infernal house! —O that your heart
would let you fly him! 
 If you should be disposed so to do, Mrs. Townsend
shall be ready at your command. —But if you
meet with no impediments, no new causes of
doubt, I think your reputation in the eye of the
world, tho' not your happiness, is concerned,
that you should be his.  — And yet I cannot bear,
that these libertines should be rewarded for their
villainy with the best of the Sex, when the worst
of it are too good for them. 
But if you meet with the least ground for suspicion; 
if he would detain you at the odious
house, or wish you to stay, now you know what
the people are,  fly him, whatever your prospects
are, as well as them. 
In one of your next airings, if you have no
other way,  refuse to return with him. Name me
for your intelligencer, that you are in a bad house; 
and if you think you cannot now break with him,
seem rather to believe that he may not know it
to be so; and that I do not believe he does:  And 

yet this belief in us both must appear to be very
gross. 
 But suppose you desire, and insist upon it, to
go out of town for the air, this sultry weather? — 
You may plead your health for so doing. He dare
not resist such a plea. Your brother's foolish
scheme, I am told, is certainly given up; so you
need not be afraid on that account. 
If you do not fly the house upon reading of this,
or some way or other get out of it, I shall judge of
his power over you, by the little you will have
over either him or yourself. 
 One of my informants has made slight inquiries,
concerning Mrs. Fretchville. Did he ever name
to you the street or square she lived in? —I don't
remember, that you, in any of yours, mentioned
either to me.  Strange, very strange, This, I think! 
No such person or house can be found, near any
of the new streets or squares, where the lights I
had from your letters led me to imagine her house
might be.  —Ask him, What street the house is in,
if he has not told you. And let me know. If he
make a difficulty of that circumstance, it will
amount to a detection.  —And yet, I think, you
have enough without this. 
I shall send this long letter by Collins, who
changes his day to oblige me; and that he may
try (now I know where you are), to get it into
your own hands. If he cannot, he will leave it
at Wilson's. As none of our letters by that conveyance
have miscarried, when you have been in
more apparently disagreeable situations than you
are in at present, I hope that This will go safe, if
Collins should be obliged to leave it there. 
 I wrote a short letter to you in my first agitations. 
It contained not above twenty lines, all
full of fright, alarm, and execration. But being
afraid, that my vehemence would too much affect 

you, I thought it better to wait a little, as well
for the reasons already hinted at, as to be able to
give you as many particulars as I could; and my
thoughts upon all. And now, I think, taking to
your aid other circumstances as they have offer'd,
or may offer, you will be sufficiently armed to resist
all his machinations, be they what they will. 
 One word more. Command me up, if I can
be of the least service or pleasure to you. I value
not fame: I value not censure; nor even life itself,
I verily think, as I do your honour, and
your friendship—For, is not your honour my honour? 
And is not your friendship the pride of my
life? 
May heaven preserve you, my dearest creature,
in honour and safety, is the prayer, the hourly
prayer, of 
Your ever-faithful and affectionate
Anna Howe. 
Thursday Morn. 5. I have
written all night. 

To Miss Howe.
My dearest creature,
How you have shock'd, confounded, surpriz'd,
astonish'd me, by your dreadful communication! 
—My heart is too weak to bear up against such a
stroke as this! —When all hope was with me! When
my prospects were so much mended! —But can there
be such villainy in men, as in this vile principal, and
equally vile agent! 
I am really ill—Very ill—Grief and surprize, and,
now I will say, despair, have overcome me! —All, all,
you have laid down as conjecture, appears to me now
to be more than conjecture! 
O that your mother would have the goodness to permit
me the presence of the only comforter that my 

afflicted, my half-broken heart, could be raised by! 
But I charge you, think not of coming up without
her indulgent permission. —I am too ill, at present, my
dear, to think of combating with this dreadful man; 
and of flying from this horrid house! —My bad writing
will shew you this. —But my illness will be my present
security, should he indeed have meditated villainy. — 
Forgive, O forgive me, my dearest friend, the trouble
I have given you! —All must soon—But why add I
grief to grief, and trouble to trouble? —But I charge
you, my beloved creature, not to think of coming
up, without your mother's leave, to the truly desolate,
and broken-spirited 
Clarissa Harlowe. 
Well, Jack! —And what thinkest thou of this
last letter? —Miss Howe values not either fame or
censure; and thinkest thou, that this letter will not
bring the little fury up, tho' she could procure no
other conveyance than her higgler's paniers, one for
herself, the other for her maid? —She knows where
to come now! —Many a little villain have I punished
for knowing more than I would have her know; and
that by adding to her knowlege and experience. — 
What thinkest thou, Belford, if by getting hither
this virago, and giving cause for a lamentable letter
from her, to the fair fugitive, I should be able to recover
her? —Would she not visit that friend in her
distress, thinkest thou, whose intended visit to her in
hers, brought her into the condition she herself had so
perfidiously escaped from? 
Let me enjoy the thought! 
Shall I send this letter? —Thou seest I have left
room, if I fail in the exact imitation of so charming a
hand, to avoid too strict a scrutiny. —Do they not
both deserve it of me? —Seest thou not how the raving
girl threatens her mother? —Ought she not to be
punish'd? —And can I be a worse devil, or villain, or 

monster, than she calls me in this letter; and has called
me in her former letters; were I to punish them
both, as my vengeance urges me to punish them. 
And when I have executed That my vengeance, how
charmingly satisfied may they both go down into the
country, and keep house together, and have a much
better reason than their pride could give them, for
living the Single-life they have both seemed so fond of? 
I will set about transcribing it this moment, I think. 
I can resolve afterwards. Yet what has poor Hickman
done to deserve this of me? —But gloriously
would it punish the mother (as well as daughter) for
all her sordid avarice; and for her undutifulness to
honest Mr. Howe, whose heart she actually broke. I
am on tip-toe, Jack, to enter upon this project. —Is
not one country as good to me as another, if I should
be obliged to take another tour upon it? 
* *
But I will not venture. Mr. Hickman is a good
man, they tell me. I love a good man. I hope one
of these days to be a good man myself. Besides, I
have heard within this week, something of this honest
fellow that shews he has a soul; when I thought, if
he had one, that it lay a little of the deepest to emerge
to notice, except on very extraordinary occasions; and
that then it presently sunk again into its Cellula adiposa. 
—The man is a plump man. —Didst ever see him,
Jack? 
But the principal reason that withholds me (for 'tis
a tempting project!) is, for fear of being utterly
blown up, if I should not be quick enough with my
letter, or if Miss Howe should deliberate on setting
out, or try her mother's consent first; in which time,
a letter from my frighted beauty might reach her; for
I have no doubt, where-ever she has refuged, but her
first work was to write to her vixen friend. I will
therefore go on patiently; and take my revenge upon
the little fury at my leisure. 

But, in spite of my compassion for Hickman, whose
better character is sometimes my envy, and who is one
of those mortals that bring clumsiness into credit with
the mothers, to the disgrace of us clever fellows, and
often to our disappointment with the daughters; and
who has been very busy in assisting these double-arm'd
beauties against me; I swear by all the Dii Majores,
as well as Minores, that I will have Miss Howe, if
I cannot have her more exalted friend! —And then,
if there be so much flaming love between these girls
as they pretend, what will my charmer profit by her
escape? 
And now, that I shall permit Miss Howe to reign
a little longer, let me ask thee, If thou hast not,
in the inclosed letter, a fresh instance, that a great
many of my difficulties with her sister-toast are owing
to this flighty girl? —'Tis true, that here was naturally
a confounded sharp wintry air; and, if a little cold
water was thrown into the path, no wonder that it was
instantly frozen; and that a poor honest traveller
found it next to impossible to keep his way; one foot
sliding back as fast as the other advanced; to the endangering
of his limbs or neck. But yet I think it
impossible, that she should have baffled me as she has
done (novice as she is, and never before from under
her parents wing), had she not been armed by a virago,
who was formerly very near shewing, that she could
better advise than practise. But this, I believe, I have
said more than once before. 
I am loth to reproach myself, now the cruel creature
has escaped me; for what would that do, but
add to my torment? Since evils self-caused, and
avoidable, admit not of palliation or comfort. And
yet, if thou tellest me, that all her strength was owing
to my weakness, and that I have been a cursed coward
in this whole affair; why then, Jack, I may blush,
and be vexed; but, by my soul, I cannot contradict
thee. 

But this, Belford, I hope—that if I can turn the
poison of this letter into wholesome aliment; that is
to say, if I can make use of it to my advantage; I
shall have thy free consent to do it. 
I am always careful to open covers cautiously, and
to preserve seals intire. I will draw out from this
cursed letter an alphabet. Nor was Nick Rowe ever
half so diligent to learn Spanish, at the Quixote recommendation
of a certain Peer, as I will be to gain a
mastery of this vixen's hand.
