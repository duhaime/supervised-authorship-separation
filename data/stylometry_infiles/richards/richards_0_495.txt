Mr. Belford, To Robert Lovelace, Esq; 

Sunday morn. 8 o'Clock, Sept. 10. 
I staid at Smith's till I saw the last of all that was mortal
of the divine lady. 
As she has directed Rings by her Will to several persons,
with her hair to be set in crystal, the afflicted Mrs. Norton
cut off before the coffin was closed four charming ringlets; 
one of which the Colonel took for a locket, which, he says,
he will cause to be made, and wear next his heart in memory
of his beloved cousin. 
Between four and five in the morning, the corpse was
put into the herse; the coffin before being filled, as intended,
with flowers and aromatic herbs, and proper care
taken to prevent the corpse suffering (to the eye) from the
jolting of the herse. 
Poor Mrs. Norton is extremely ill. I gave particular
directions to Mrs. Smith's maid (whom I have ordered to
attend the good woman in a mourning chariot) to take
care of her. The Colonel, who rides with his servants within
view of the herse, says, that he will see my orders in relation
to her inforced. 
When the herse moved off and was out of sight, I
locked up the lady's chamber, into which all that had belonged
to her was removed. 
I expect to hear from the Colonel as soon as he is got
down, by a servant of his own.
