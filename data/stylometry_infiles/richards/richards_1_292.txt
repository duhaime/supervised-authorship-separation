Mr. Lovelace, To John Belford, Esq; 

Just come from my Charmer. She will not suffer
me to say half the obliging, the tender things, which
my honest heart is ready to overflow with. A confounded
situation That, when a man finds himself in
humour to be eloquent, and pathetic at the same time; 
yet cannot engage the mistress of his fate to lend an
ear to his fine speeches. 
I can account now, how it comes about, that Lovers,
when their mistresses are cruel, run into solitude, and
disburden their minds to Stocks and Stones: For am I
not forced to make my complaints to Thee? 
She claimed the performance of my promise, the
moment she saw me, of permitting her [haughtily she
spoke the word] to go to Hamstead, as soon as I was
gone to Berks. 
Most chearfully I renewed it. 
She desired me to give orders in her hearing. 
I sent for Dorcas and Will. They came. —Do you
both take notice [But, perhaps, Sir, I may take you
with me] that your Lady is to be obeyed in all her commands. 
She purposes to return to Hamstead as soon as
I am gone—My dear, will you not have a servant to
attend you? 
I shall want no servant there. 
Will you take Dorcas? 
If I should want Dorcas, I can send for her. 
Dorcas could not but say, She should be very proud— 
Well, well, that may be at my return, if your Lady
permit—Shall I, my dear, call up Mrs. Sinclair, and
give her orders to the same effect, in your hearing? 
I desire not to see Mrs. Sinclair; nor any that belong
to her. 
As you please, Madam. 

And then (the servants being withdrawn) I urged
her again for the assurance, that she would meet me at
the Altar on Thursday next. But to no purpose—May
she not thank herself for all that may follow? 
One favour, however, I would not be denied; to
be admitted to pass the evening with her. 
All sweetness and obsequiousness will I be on this occasion. 
My whole Soul shall be poured out to move
her to forgive me. If she will not, and if the promisory-note
should fall in my way, my Revenge will
doubtless take total possession of me. 
All the house in my interest, and every one in it not
only engaging to intimidate and assist, as occasion shall
offer, but staking all their experience upon my success,
if it be not my own fault, what must be the consequence? 
This, Jack, however, shall be her last trial; and if
she behave as nobly in and after this second attempt [All
her Senses about her] as she has done after the first, she
will come out an angel upon full proof, in spite of
man, woman, and devil: Then shall there be an end
of all her sufferings. I will then renounce that vanquished
devil, and reform. And if any vile machination
start up, presuming to mislead me, I will sooner
stab it in my heart as it rises, than give way to it. 
A few hours will now decide all. But whatever be
the event, I shall be too busy to write again, till I get
to M. Hall. 
Mean time I am in strange agitations. I must suppress
them, if possible, before I venture into her presence
—My heart bounces my bosom from the table. I
will lay down my pen, and wholly resign to its impulses.
