Miss Clarissa Harlowe, To Miss Howe. 
[Inclosed in the preceding.] 

Thursday, July 27. 
My dearest Miss Howe,
Since you seem loth to acquiesce in my determined
resolution, signified to you as soon as I was
able to hold a pen, I beg the favour of you, by this,
or by any other way you think most proper, to acquaint
the worthy Ladies who have applied to you in
behalf of their Relation, that, altho' I am infinitely
obliged to their generous opinion of me, yet I cannot
consent to sanctify, as I may say, Mr. Lovelace's
repeated breaches of all moral sanctions, and hazard
my future happiness by an union with a man, thro'
whose premeditated injuries, in a long train of the
basest contrivances, I have forfeited my temporal
hopes. 

He himself, when he reflects upon his own actions,
must surely bear testimony to the justice as well as
fitness of my determination. The Ladies, I dare say,
would, were they to know the whole of my unhappy
Story. 
Be pleased to acquaint them, that I deceive myself,
if my resolution on this head (however ungratefully,
and even inhumanly, he has treated me) be not owing
more to Principle than Passion. Nor can I give a
stronger proof of the truth of this assurance, than by
declaring, that I can and will forgive him, on this
one easy condition, That he will never molest me
more. 
In whatever way you chuse to make this declaration,
be pleased to let my most respectful compliments to
the Ladies of the noble family, and to my Lord M.
accompany it. And do you, my dear, believe, that
I shall be, to the last moment of my life, 
Your ever-obliged and affectionate
Clarissa Harlowe.
