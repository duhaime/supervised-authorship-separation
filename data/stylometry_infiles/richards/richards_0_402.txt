Mr. Belford, To Robert Lovelace, Esq; 

Friday, Aug. 11. 
Mr. Belford acquaints his friend with the generosity of
Lord M. and the Ladies of his family; and with the
lady's grateful sentiments upon the occasion. 
He says, that in hopes to avoid the pain of seeing him, she intends
to answer his letter of the 7th, tho' much against her
inclination. ‘She took great notice, says Mr. Belford, of 

that passage in yours, which makes necessary to the
Divine pardon, the forgiveness of a person causelesly
injured.’ 
‘Her grandfather, I find, has enabled her at eighteen
years of age to make her will, and to devise great
part of his estate to whom she pleases of the family,
and the rest out of it (if she die single), at her own
discretion; and this to create respect to her; as he apprehended
that she would be envied: And she now
resolves to set about making her will out of hand.’ 
Mr. Belford insists upon the promise he had made him, not to
molest the lady: And gives him the contents of her answer
to Lord M. and the Ladies, declining their generous offers.
