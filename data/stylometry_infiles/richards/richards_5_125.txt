Miss Byron. In Continuation. 


Sunday Night, April 2. 
Dr. Bartlett has received from Sir Charles an account
of what passed last Friday between him,
and Sir Harry, and Lady Beauchamp: By the doctor's
allowance, I inclose it to you. 
In this Letter, Lucy, you will see him in a new
light; and as a man whom there is no resisting, when
he resolves to carry a point. But it absolutely convinces
me, of what indeed I before suspected, that
he has not an high opinion of our sex in general:
And this I will put down as a blot in his character. 
He treats us, in Lady Beauchamp, as perverse humoursome
babies, loving power, yet not knowing
how to use it. See him so delicate in his behaviour
and address to Miss Mansfield, and carry in
your thoughts his gaiety and adroit management to
Lady Beauchamp, as in this letter, and you will hardly
think him the same man. Could he be any-thing to
me, I should be more than half afraid of him: Yet
this may be said in his behalf;—He but accommodates
himself to the persons he has to deal with:—He
can be a man of gay wit, when he pleases to descend,
as indeed his sister Charlotte has as often found, as she
has given occasion for the exercise of that talent in
him;—and, that virtue, for its own sake, is his choice; 
since had he been a free-liver, he would have been a
dangerous man. But I will not anticipate too much:
Read it here, if you please.
