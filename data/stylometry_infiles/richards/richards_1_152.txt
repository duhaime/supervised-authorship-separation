Miss Clarissa Harlowe, To Miss Howe. 

Saturday Afternoon, April 22. 
O my best, my only friend! Now indeed is my
heart broken! It has received a blow it never will
recover. Think not of corresponding with a wretch
who now seems absolutely devoted. How can it be
otherwise, if a parent's curses have the weight I always
attributed to them, and have heard so many instances
in confirmation of that weight! —Yes, my dear Miss
Howe, superadded to all my afflictions, I have the consequences
of a Father's Curse to struggle with! How
shall I support this reflection! —My past and my present
situation so much authorizing my apprehensions! 
I have, at last, a Letter from my unrelenting Sister. 
Would to Heaven I had not provoked it by my second
Letter to my Aunt Hervey! It lay ready for me, it
seems. The thunder slept, till I awakened it. I inclose
the Letter itself. Transcribe it I cannot. There is
no bearing the thoughts of it: For [Shocking reflection!]
the Curse extends to the life beyond This. 
I am in the depth of vapourish despondency. I can
only repeat, Shun, fly, correspond not with a wretch
so devoted, as 
Clarissa Harlowe.
