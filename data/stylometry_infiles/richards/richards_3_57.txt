I Have now all the Reason that can be, to apprehend
my Master will be here soon; for the
Servants are all busy in setting the House to rights; 
and a Stable and Coach-house are cleaning out, that
have not been us'd some time. I ask Mrs. Jewkes;
but she tells me nothing, nor will hardly answer me
when I ask her a Question. Sometimes I think she
puts on these strange wicked Airs to me, purposely
to make me wish for what I dread most of all
Things, my Master's coming down. He talk of
Love! —If he had any the least Notion of Regard
for me, to be sure he would not give this naughty 

Body such Power over me: —And if he does come,
where is his Promise of not seeing me without I
consent to it? But it seems His Honour owes me
nothing! So he tells me in his Letter; and why? 
Because I am willing to keep mine. But, indeed,
he says, he hates me perfectly; and it is plain he
does, or I should not be left to the Mercy of this
Woman; and, what is worse, to my woful Apprehensions.
