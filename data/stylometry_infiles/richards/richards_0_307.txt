Mrs. Hodges. In Answer. 

Sat. July 1. 
Maddam,
I return you an anser, as you wish me to doe. Master is acquented with no sitch man. I am
shure no sitch ever came to our house. And master
sturs very little out. He has no harte to stur out. 
For why? Your obstincy makes um not care to see
one another. Master's birth-day never was keept soe
before: For not a sole heere; and nothing but siking
and sorrowin from master, to think how it yused to
bee. 

I axsed master, if soe bee he knoed sitch a man as
one Captain Tomlinson? But sayed not whirfor I axsed. 
He sed, No, not he. 
Shure this is no trix nor forgary bruing agenst master
by won Tomlinsonâ€”Won knoes not what cumpany
you may have bin forsed to keep, sen you went
away, you knoe, Maddam. Ecscuse me, Maddam; 
but Lundon is a pestilent plase; and that Squire
Luveless is a devil (for all he is sitch a like gentleman
to look to), as I hev herd every boddy say; and
thinke as how you have found by thiss. 
I truste, Maddam, you wulde not let master cum
to harme, if you knoed it, by any boddy, whoe may
pretend too be acquented with him: But, for fere,
I querid with myself iff I shulde not tell him. Butt
I was willin to show you, that I wulde plessure you in
advarsity, if advarsity bee youre lott, as wel as prosprity; 
for I am none of those as woulde doe otherwis. 
Soe noe more frum 
Your humbell sarvant, to wish you well,
Sarah Hodges.
