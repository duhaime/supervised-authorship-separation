Nothing particular having passed at Dinner and
Supper, but the most condescending Goodness,
on my Lady's side, to me; and the highest
Civilities from Mr. Peters's Family; from Lady 
Jones, from Sir Simon's Family, &c. and reciprocal
good Wishes all round; and a Promise obtain'd
from my Benefactor, that he would endeavour to
pass a Fortnight or three Weeks in these Parts, before
the Winter set in; I shall conclude this Day
with observing, that I disposed of the Money my
Master was so good to put into my Hands, in the
Method he was pleased to direct; and I gave Mrs.
Jewkes hers, in such a manner, as highly pleased
her; and she wished me, with Tears, all kind of
Happiness; and pray'd me to forgive her all her
past Wickedness to me, as she herself called it. I
begg'd Leave of my Master to present Mrs. Worden
with Five Guineas, for a Pair of Gloves; which
he said was well thought of.
