Mrs. Norton, To Miss Clarissa Harlowe. 

Monday, July 24. 
Excuse, my dearest young Lady, my long silence. I
have been extremely ill. My poor boy has also been
at death's door; and, when I hoped that he was better,
he has relapsed. Alas! my dear, he is very dangerously
ill. Let us both have your prayers! 
Very angry letters have passed between your sister
and Miss Howe. Every-one of your family is incensed
against that young lady. I wish you would remonstrate
against her warmth; since it can do no good; for they
will not believe, but that her interposition has your connivance; 
nor that you are so ill as Miss Howe assures them
you are. 
Before she wrote, they were going to send up young
Mr. Brand the clergyman, to make private inquiries of
your health, and way of lifeâ€”But now they are so exasperated,
that they have laid aside their intention. 
We have flying reports here, and at Harlowe-Place, of 

some fresh insults which you have undergone: And that
you are about to put yourself into Lady Betty Lawrance's
protection. I believe they would now be glad (as I should
be), that you would do so; and this, perhaps, will make
them suspend for the present any determination in your
favour. 
How unhappy am I, that the dangerous way my son
is in prevents my attendance on you! Let me beg of you
to write me word how you are, both as to person and
mind. A servant of Sir Robert Beachcroft, who rides
post on his master's business to town, will present you
with this; and, perhaps, will bring me the favour of a
few lines in return. He will be obliged to stay in town
several hours, for an answer to his dispatches. 
This is the anniversary,that used to give joy to as many
as had the pleasure and honour of knowing you. May
the Almighty bless you, and grant, that it may be the
only unhappy one that may be ever known by you, my
dearest young Lady; and by 
Your ever-affectionate
Judith Norton.
