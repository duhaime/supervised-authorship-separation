There being Reason to apprehend, from the
former Attempts of some Imitators, who supposing
the Story of Pamela a Fiction, have murder'd
that excellent Lady, and mistaken and misrepresented
other (suppos'd imaginary) Characters,
that Persons may not be wanting, who will impose
new Continuations upon the Publick: 
It is with a View to some Designs of this Nature,
that the Editor gives this publick Assurance, by way
of Prevention, That all the Copies of Mrs. B.'s
Observations and Writings, upon every Subject
hinted at in the preceding Four Volumes, and in
particular those relating to Devotion, Education,
Plays, &c. are now in One hand Only: And that,
if ever they shall be published, (which at present is
a Point undetermined) it must not be, till after a
certain Event, as unwished, as deplorable: And
then, solely, at the Assignment of Samuel Richardson,
of Salisbury-Court, Fleetstreet, the
Editor of these Four Volumes of PAMELA;
or, Virtue Rewarded.
