Miss Clarissa Harlowe, To Miss Howe. 

Tues. March 7. 
By my last deposite, you'll see how I am driven,
and what a poor prisoner I am: No regard had
to my reputation. The whole matter is now before
you. Can such measures be supposed to soften?—But 

surely they can only mean to try to frighten me into
my brother's views. —All my hope is, to be able to
weather this point till my cousin Morden comes from
Florence; and he is expected soon. Yet, if they are
determined upon a short day, I doubt he will not be
here time enough to save me. 
It is plain, by my brother's letter, that my mamma
has not spared me, in the report she has made of the
conferences between herself and me: Yet she was
pleased to hint to me, that my brother had views which
she would have had me try to disappoint. —But she had
engaged to give a faithful account of what was to pass
between herself and me: And it was doubtless, much
more eligible to give up a daughter, than to disoblige
a husband, and every other person of the family. 
They think they have done every-thing by turning
away my poor Hannah: But as long as the liberty
of the garden, and my poultry-visits are allowed
me, they will be mistaken. 
I asked Mrs. Betty, If she had any orders to watch
or attend me? or, Whether I were to ask her Leave,
whenever I should be disposed to walk in the garden,
or to go to feed my Bantams? 
Lord bless her! what could I mean by such a
question! —Yet she owned, that she had heard, that
I was not to walk in the garden when my papa,
mamma, or uncles were there. 
However, as it behoved me to be assured on this
head, I went down directly, and staid an hour, without
question or impediment: And yet a good part
of the time, I walked under, and in sight (as I may
say) of, my brother's Study-window; where both he
and my sister happened to be. And I am sure they
saw me, by the loud mirth they affected; by way of
insult, as I suppose. 
So this part of my restraint was doubtless a stretch
of the authority given him. The inforcing of that
may perhaps come next. But I hope not. 

Tuesday night. 
Since I wrote the above, I have ventured to send
a letter by Shorey, to my mamma. I directed her to
give it into her own hand, when nobody was by. 
I shall inclose the copy of it. You'll see that I
would have it thought, that now Hannah is gone, I
have no way to correspond out of the house. I am
far from thinking all I do, right. I am afraid, this is
a little piece of art, that is not so. But this is an afterthought: 
The letter went first. 

Honoured Madam,
Having acknowledged to you, that I had received
letters from Mr. Lovelace, full of resentment,
and that I answered them purely to prevent
further mischief; and having shew'd you copies of
my answers, which you did not disapprove of, altho'
you thought fit, after you had read them, to forbid
me any further correspondence with him; I think it
my duty to acquaint you, that another letter from him
has since come to my hand, in which he is very earnest
with me to permit him to wait on my papa, or you,
or my two uncles, in a pacific way, accompanied by
Lord M. —On which I beg your commands. 
I own to you, Madam, that had not the prohibition
been renew'd, and had not Hannah been so suddenly
dismissed my service, I should have made the less
scruple to have written an answer, and to have commanded
her to convey it to him with all speed, in
order to dissuade him from these visits, lest any thing
should happen on the occasion, that my heart akes
but to think of. 
And here, I cannot but express my grief, that I
should have all the punishment, and all the blame,
who, as I have reason to think, have prevented great
mischief, and have not been the occasion of any. 
For, Madam, could I be supposed to govern the passions
of either of the gentleman? —Over the one indeed, 

I have some little influence, without giving
him hitherto any reason to think he has fasten'd an
obligation upon me for it. —Over the other, Who,
Madam, has any? 
I am grieved at heart, to be obliged to lay so great
blame at my brother's door, altho' my reputation and
my liberty are both to be sacrific'd to his resentment
and ambition. May not, however, so deep a sufferer
be permitted to speak out? 
This communication being as voluntarily made, as
dutifully intended; I humbly presume to hope, that I
shall not be required to produce the letter itself. I cannot
either in honour or prudence do that, because of the
vehemence of his style; for having heard [not, I assure
you, by my means, or thro' Hannah's] of some
part of the harsh treatment I have met with; he thinks
himself intitled to place it to his own account, by
reason of speeches thrown out by some of my relations
equally vehement. 
If I do not answer him, he will be made desperate,
and think himself justified [tho' I shall not think him
so] in resenting the treatment he complains of: If I
do, and if, in compliment to me, he forbears to resent
what he thinks himself intitled to resent; be pleased,
Madam, to consider the obligation he will suppose he
lays me under. 
If I were as strongly prepossessed in his favour as is
supposed, I should not have wish'd this to be consider'd
by you. —And permit me, as a still further proof that
I am not prepossessed, to beg of you to consider, Whether,
upon the whole, the proposal I made of declaring
for the Single Life (which I will religiously adhere
to) is not the best way, to get rid of his pretensions
with honour. To renounce him, and not to
be allowed to aver, that I will never be the other man's,
will make him conclude (driven as I am driven), that
I am determined in that other man's favour. 
If this has not its due weight, my brother's strange 

schemes must be try'd, and I will resign myself to
my destiny, with all the acquiescence that shall be
granted to my prayers. And so leaving the whole to
your own wisdom, and whether you choose to consult
my papa and uncles upon this humble application,
or not; or whether I shall be allowed to write an
answer to Mr. Lovelace, or not (and if allow'd so to
do, I beg your direction, by whom to send it); I remain, 
Honoured Madam,
Your unhappy, but ever-dutiful daughter,
Cl. Harlowe. 
Wednesday morning. 
I have just received an answer to the inclosed letter. 
My mamma, you'll observe, has ordered me to burn
it: But, as you will have it in your safe keeping,
and nobody else will see it, her end will be equally
answer'd. It has neither date nor superscription. 

Clarissa,
Say not all the blame, and all the punishment, is
yours. I am as much blam'd, and as much
punish'd, as you are; yet am more innocent. When
your obstinacy is equal to any other person's passion,
blame not your brother. We judg'd right, that Hannah
carry'd on your correspondencies. Now she is gone,
and you cannot write (we think you cannot) to Miss
Howe, nor she to you, without our knowlege, one
cause of uneasiness and jealousy is over. 
I had no dislike to Hannah. I did not tell her so; 
because Somebody was within hearing, when she desired
to pay her duty to me at going: I gave her a
caution, in a raised voice, To take care, where-ever
she went to live next, if there were any young Ladies,
how she made parties, and assisted in clandestine correspondencies: 
—But I slid two guineas into her hand. 

Nor was I angry to hear you were more bountiful to
her—So much for Hannah. 
I don't know what to write, about your answering
that man of violence. What can you think of it,
that such a family as ours, should have such a rod held
over it? —For my part, I have not own'd that I
know you have corresponded: By your last boldness
to me (an astonishing one it was, to pursue before
Mr. Solmes, the subject that I was forced to break
from above stairs) you may, as far as I know, plead,
that you had my countenance for your correspondence
with him; and so add to the uneasiness between your
papa and me. You was once all my comfort: You
made all my hardships tolerable: —But now! — 
However, nothing, it is plain, can move you; and I
will say no more on that head: For you are under
your papa's discipline now; and he will neither be
prescribed to, nor intreated. 
I should have been glad to see the letter you tell
me of, as I saw the rest: —You say, both honour
and prudence forbid you to shew it me! —O
Clarissa! what think you of receiving letters that
honour and prudence forbid you to shew to a mother! 
—But it is not for me to see it, if you would
choose to shew it me. I will not be in your secret. 
I will not know that you did correspond. And, as to
an answer, take your own methods. But let him
know it will be the last you will write. And, if you
do write, I won't see it: So seal it up, if you do, and
give it to Shorey, and she—Yet do not think I give
you licence to write! 
We will be upon no conditions with him, nor will
you be allow'd to be upon any. Your papa and uncles
would have no patience were he to come. What
have you to do to oblige him with your refusal of Mr.
Solmes? —Will not That refusal be to give him
hope? And while he has any, can we be easy or free
from his insults? Were even your brother in fault, as 

that fault cannot be conquer'd, is a sister to carry on
a correspondence that shall endanger her brother? But
your papa has given his sanction to your brother's dislikes,
and they are now your papa's dislikes, and my
dislikes, your uncles and every-body's! —No matter
to whom owing. 
As to the rest, you have by your obstinacy put it
out of my power to do any-thing for you. Your
papa takes upon himself to be answerable for all consequences. 
You must not therefore apply to me for
any favour. I shall endeavour to be only an observer; 
Happy, if I could be an unconcerned one! —While I
had power, you would not let me use it as I would
have used it. Your aunt has been forced to engage
not to interfere but by your papa's direction. You'll
have severe trials. If you have any favour to hope
for, it must be from the mediation of your uncles. 
And yet I believe, they are equally determin'd: For
they make it a principle—(Alas! they never had
children!) that that child, who in marriage is not govern'd
by her parents, is to be given up as a lost creature! 
I charge you, let not this letter be found. Burn
it. There is too much of the mother in it, to a
daughter so unaccountably obstinate. 
Write not another letter to me, I can do nothing
for you. But you can do every thing for yourself. 
Now, my dear, to proceed with my melancholy
narrative. 
After this letter, you will believe, that I could have
very little hopes, that an application directly to my
father, would stand me in any stead: But I thought
it became me to write, were it but to acquit myself
to myself, that I have left nothing unattempted, that
has the least likelihood to restore me to his favour. 
Accordingly I wrote to the following effect: 
‘I presume not, I say, to argue with my papa, I 

only beg his mercy and indulgence in this one point,
on which depends my present and perhaps my future
happiness; and beseech him not to reprobate
his child for an aversion which it is not in her power
to conquer, I beg, that I may not be sacrific'd to
projects, and remote contingencies: I complain of
the disgraces I suffer in this banishment from his presence,
and in being confined to my chamber. In
every thing but this one point, I promise implicit
duty and resignation to his will. I repeat my offers
of a Single Life; and appeal to him, whether I have
ever given him cause to doubt my word. I beg
to be admitted to his, and to my mamma's presence,
and that my conduct may be under their own eye: 
And this with the more earnestness, as I have too
much reason to believe, that snares are laid for me; 
and tauntings and revilings used, on purpose to make
a handle of my words against me, when I am not
permitted to speak in my own defence. I conclude
with hoping, that my brother's instigations may not
rob an unhappy child of her father.’ 
This is the cruel answer, sent without superscription,
and unsealed, altho' by Betty Barnes, who
delivered it with an air, as if she knew the contents. 

Wednesday. 
I write, perverse girl, but with all the indignation
that your disobedience deserves. To desire to be
forgiven a faul, you own, and yet resolve to persevere
in, is a boldness, no more to be equall'd, than passed
over. It is my authority you defy. Your reflections
upon a brother, that is an honour to us all, deserve
my utmost resentment. I see how light all relationship
sits upon you. The cause I guess at, too: I cannot
bear the reflections that naturally arise from this
consideration. Your behaviour to your too indulgent,
and too fond mother—But, I have no patience— 

Continue banished from my presence, undutiful as you
are, till you know how to conform to my will. Ingrateful
creature! Your letter but upbraids me for
my past indulgence. Write no more to me, till you
can distinguish better; and till you are convinc'd of
your duty to 
A justly incensed Father. 
This angry letter was accompany'd with one from
my mamma, unsealed, and unsuperscribed also. Those
who take so much pains to confederate every one
against me, I make no doubt, obliged her to bear her
testimony against the poor girl. 
This letter being a repetition of some of the severe
things that passed between my mamma and me, of
which I have given you an account, I shall not need
to give you the contents—Only thus far, that she
also praises my brother, and blames me for my freedoms
with him.
