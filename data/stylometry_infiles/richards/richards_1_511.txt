Mr. Belford, To Robert Lovelace, Esq; 

Sunday Morn. 8 o'Clock, Sept. 10. 
I staid at Smith's till I saw the Last of all that is mortal
of the divine Lady. 
As she has directed Rings by her Will to several persons,
with her hair to be set in crystal, the afflicted
Mrs. Norton cut off, before the coffin was closed, four
charming ringlets; one of which the Colonel took for
a locket, which, he says, he will cause to be made,
and wear next his heart in memory of his beloved
Cousin. 
Between Four and Five in the morning, the corpse
was put into the herse; the coffin before being filled,
as intended, with flowers and aromatic herbs, and proper
care taken to prevent the corpse suffering (to the
eye) from the jolting of the herse. 
Poor Mrs. Norton is extremely ill. I gave particular
directions to Mrs. Smith's maid (whom I have
ordered to attend the good woman in a mourning chariot)
to take care of her. The Colonel, who rides
with his servants within view of the herse, says, that
he will see my orders in relation to her enforced. 
When the herse moved off, and was out of sight, I
locked up the Lady's chamber, into which all that had
belonged to her was removed. 

I expect to hear from the Colonel as soon as he is got
down, by a servant of his own.
