Miss Howe, To Miss Clarissa Harlowe. 

Thursday, May 18. 
I have neither time nor patience, my dear friend,
to answer every material article in your last Letters 

just now received. Mr. Lovelace's proposals are
all I like of him. And yet (as you do) I think, that
he concludes them not with that warmth and earnestness
which we might naturally have expected from
him. Never in my life did I hear or read of so patient
a man, with such a blessing in his reach. But
wretches of his cast, between you and me, my dear,
have not, I fansy, the ardors that honest men have. 
Who knows, as your Bell once spitefully said, but
he may have half a dozen creatures to quit his hands
of before he engages for life? —Yet I believe you
must not expect him to be honest on this side of his
grand climacteric. 
He, to suggest delay from a compliment to be
made to Lord M. and to give time for Settlements! 
He, a part of whose character it is, not to know
what complaisance to his relations is—I have no patience
with him! You did indeed want an interposing
friend on the affecting occasion which you mention
in yours of yesterday morning. But, upon my
word, were I to have been that moment in your
situation, and been so treated, I would have torn
his eyes out, and left it to his own heart, when I had
done, to furnish the reason for it. 
Would to Heaven to-morrow, without complimenting
any-body, might be his happy day! Villain! After
he had himself suggested the compliment! —And I
think he accuses You of delaying! —Fellow, that
he is! —How my heart is wrung— 
But, as matters now stand betwixt you, I am very
unseasonable in expressing my resentments against
him. —Yet I don't know whether I am or not, neither; 
since it is the most cruel of fates, for a woman
to be forced to have a man whom her heart despises. 
You must, at least, despise him; at times, however. 
His clenched fist offered to his forehead on your leaving
him in just displeasure—I wish it had been a poleax,
and in the hand of his worst enemy. 

I will endeavour to think of some method, of some
scheme, to get you from him, and to fix you safely
somewhere till your Cousin Morden arrives—A
scheme to lie by you, and to be pursued as occasion
may be given. You are sure, that you can go abroad
when you please? and that our correspondence is safe? 
I cannot, however (for the reasons heretofore mentioned
respecting your own reputation) wish you to
leave him while he gives you not cause to suspect
his honour. But your heart I know would be the
easier, if you were sure of some asylum in case of
necessity. 
Yet once more, I say, I can have no notion that
he can or dare to mean you dishonour. But then the
man is a fool, my dear—that's all. 
However, since you are thrown upon a fool, marry
the fool, at the first opportunity; and tho' I doubt
that this man will be the most ungovernable of fools,
as all witty and vain fools are, take him as a punishment,
since you cannot as a reward: In short, as one
given to convince you that there is nothing but imperfection
in this life. 
&dotup;And what is the result of all I have written, but
this? Either marry, my dear, or get from them all,
and from him too. 
&dotup;You intend the latter, you'll say, as soon as you
have opportunity. That, as above hinted, I hope
quickly to furnish you with: And then comes on
a tryal between you and yourself. 
&dotup;These are the very fellows, that we women do
not naturally hate. We don't always know what
is, and what is not, in our power to do. When
some principal point we have long had in view becomes
so critical, that we must of necessity chuse
or refuse, then perhaps we look about us; are affrighted
at the wild and uncertain prospect before
us; and after a few struggles and heart-achs, reject
the untried New; draw in our horns, and 

resolve to snail-on, as we did before, in a track
we are acquainted with.&dotup; 
I shall be impatient till I have your next. I am,
my dearest friend, 
Your ever-affectionate and faithful
Anna Howe.
