My dearest Child,
Our Hearts bleed for your Distress, and the
Temptations you are expos'd to. You have
our hourly Prayers; and we would have you
flee this evil Great House and Man, if you find
he renews his Attempts. You ought to have
done it at first, had you not had Mrs. Jervis to
advise with. We can find no Fault in your
Conduct hitherto: But it makes our Hearts
ake for fear of the worst. O my Child! 
Temptations are sore things; but yet, without
them, we know not ourselves, nor what we
are able to do. 
Your Danger is very great; for you have
Riches, Youth, and a fine Gentleman, as the
World reckons him, to withstand; but how
great will be your Honour to withstand them! 
And when we consider your past Conduct, and
your virtuous Education, and that you have
been bred to be more asham'd of Dishonesty
than Poverty, we trust in God, that He will
enable you to overcome. Yet, as we can't see
but your Life must be a Burden to you, through
the great Apprehensions always upon you; 
and that it may be presumptuous to trust too
much to your own Strength; and that you are
but very young; and the Devil may put it into
his Head to use some Stratagem, of which great
Men are full, to decoy you; I think you had
better come home to share our Poverty with 

Safety, than live with so much Discontent in a
Plenty, that itself may be dangerous. God direct
you for the best! While you have Mrs.
Jervis for an Adviser, and Bed-fellow, (and,
O my dear Child, that was prudently done of
you!) we are easier than we should be; and
so committing you to the Divine Protection,
remain 
Your truly loving,
but careful, Father and Mother.
