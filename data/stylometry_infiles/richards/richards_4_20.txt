My dearest Daughter,
Welcome, welcome, ten times welcome,
shall you be to us; for you come
to us innocent, and happy, and honest; and you
are the Staff of our old Age, and our Comfort. 
And tho' we cannot do for you as we would,
yet fear not we shall live happily together; and
what with my diligent Labour, and your poor
Mother's Spinning, and your Needle-work, I
make no Doubt we shall do better and better. 
Only your poor Mother's Eyes begin to
fail her; tho' I bless God, I am as strong, and
able, and willing to labour as ever; and O my
dear Child, your Virtue has made me, I think,
stronger and better than I was before. What
blessed Things are Trials and Temptations,
when we have the Strength to resist and subdue
them! 
But I am uneasy about those same Four
Guineas: I think you should give them back
again to your Master; and yet I have broken
them. Alas! I have only Three left; but I will
borrow the Fourth, if I can, Part upon my
Wages, and Part of Mrs. Mumford, and send
the whole Sum back to you, that you may return 

it against John comes next, if he comes
again before you. 
I want to know how you come. I fansy
honest John will be glad to bear you Company
Part of the Way, if your Master is not so cross
as to forbid him. And if I know time enough,
your Mother will go one Five Miles, and I
will go Ten on the Way, or till I meet you, as
far as one Holiday will go; for that I can get
Leave to make on such an Occasion: And we
shall receive you with more Pleasure than we
had at your Birth, when all the worst was over; 
or than we ever had in our Lives. 
And so God bless you, till the happy Time
comes! say both your Mother and I; which is
all at present, from 
Your truly loving Parents.
