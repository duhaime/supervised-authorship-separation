Miss Howe, To Mrs. Judith Norton. 

Saturday Evening, May 13. 
Dear good Woman,
Your Beloved's honour is inviolate! —Must be
inviolate! And will be so, in spite of men and
devils. Could I have had hope of a Reconciliation,
all my view was, that she should not have had this 

man. —All that can be said now, is, She must run
the risk of a bad husband: She, of whom no man
living is worthy! 
You pity her Mother—So do not I! I pity no Mother,
that puts it out of her power to shew maternal
Love, and Humanity, in order to patch up for herself
a precarious and sorry quiet, which every blast of
wind shall disturb. 
I hate tyrants in every form and shape: But paternal
and maternal tyrants are the worst of all: For
they can have no bowels. 
I repeat, that I pity none of them. Our beloved
friend only deserves pity. She had never been in the
hands of this man, but for them. She is quite blameless. 
You don't know all her Story. Were I to tell
you that she had no intention to go off with this man,
it would avail her nothing. It would only serve to
condemn, with those who drove her to extremities,
him, who now must be her refuge. I am 
Your sincere Friend and Servant,
Anna Howe.
