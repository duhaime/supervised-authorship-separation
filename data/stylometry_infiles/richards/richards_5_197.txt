Lady G. To Miss Byron. 
[With the preceding seven Letters of Sir Charles.] 


Grosvenor-Square, Tuesday, Aug. 8.
Good God, my dear! —I dispatch a pacquet to
you; received, a few hours ago, from Dr. Bartlett,
with desire of forwarding it to you. My sister
was with me. We read the Letters together. I dispatch
them by an express messenger—What shall we
say? Tell me, Harriet. More suspense still. Dear
creature, tell me, tell me, all you think of the contents 

of this pacquet. If I enter into the particulars, I shall
never have done scribbling. Adieu, my Love! 
Charlotte G. 
Return the Letters, when perused. I want to study
them before the Doctor has them back.
