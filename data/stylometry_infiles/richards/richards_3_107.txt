The Two former Volumes of Pamela;
or, Virtue Rewarded, met
with a Success greatly exceeding the most
sanguine Expectations: And the Editor
hopes, that the Letters which compose these,
will be found equally written to Nature,
avoiding all romantick Flights, improbable
Surprizes, and irrational Machinery; 
and that the Passions are touched, where
requisite, and Rules, equally New and
Practicable, inculcated throughout the
Whole, for the General Conduct of Life:
And, therefore he flatters himself, that
they may expect the good Fortune, which
few Continuations have met with, to be
judg'd not unworthy the First; nor disproportion'd 

to the more exalted Condition
in which Pamela was destin'd to shine,
as an affectionate Wife, a faithful Friend,
a polite and kind Neighbour, an indulgent
Mother, and a beneficent Mistress;
after having in the Two former Volumes
supported the Character of a dutiful Child,
a spotless Virgin, and a modest and amiable
Bride. 
The Reader will easily see, that, in so
great a Choice of Materials, as must arise
from a Multitude of important Subjects
in a married Life, to such Genius's and
Friendships as those of Mr. and Mrs. B.
the Editor's greatest Difficulty was, how
to bring them within the Compass which
he was determined not to exceed. And it
having been left to his own Choice, in
what manner to digest and publish the
Letters, and where to close the Work, he
had intended, at first, in regard to his
other Avocations, and some Designs of 

another Nature in which he was engaged,
to have carry'd the Piece no farther than
the Two former Volumes; as may be gather'd
from the Conclusion of the First Five
Editions. 
It may be expected, therefore, that he
should enter into an Explanation of the
Reasons whereby he was provoked into a
Necessity of altering his Intention. But
he is willing to decline saying Any-thing
upon so well-known a Subject; lest his
Interest might appear more concern'd, than
the Satisfaction of the Publick. 
The Editor has been much press'd with
Importunities and Conjectures in relation
to the Person and Family of the incomparable
Lady, who is the Subject of these
Volumes: All that he thinks himself at
Liberty to say, or is necessary to be said,
is only to repeat what has been already
hinted, That the Story has its Foundation in 

Truth: That the most material Incidents
(as will be collected from several Passages
in the Letters) happen'd between the
Years 1717 and 1730: And that there
was a Necessity, for obvious Reasons, to
vary and disguise some Facts and Circumstances,
as also the Names of Persons,
Places, &c.
