Miss Charlotte Montague, To Miss Howe. 

M. Hall, Tuesday Afternoon. 
Dear Miss Howe,
Your Letter has infinitely disturbed us all. 
This wretched man has been half distracted
ever since Saturday night. 
We knew not what ailed him, till your Letter was
brought. 
Vile wretch, as he is, he is however innocent of
this new evil. 
Indeed he is, he must be; as I shall more at large
acquaint you. 
But will not now detain your messenger. 
Only to satisfy your just impatience, by telling you,
that the dear young Lady is safe, and, we hope, well. 
A horrid mistake of his general orders has subjected
her to the terror and disgrace of an Arrest. 
Poor dear Miss Harlowe! â€”Her Sufferings have
endeared her to us, almost as much as her Excellencies
can have endeared her to you. 
But she must be now quite at liberty. 
He has been a distracted man, ever since the news
was brought him; and we knew not what ailed him. 
But that I said before. 
My Lord M. my Lady Sarah Sadleir, and my
Lady Betty Lawrance, will all write to you this very
afternoon. 
And so will the wretch himself. 
And send it by a servant of their own, not to detain
yours. 
I know not what I write. 
But you shall have all the particulars, just, and true,
and fair, from, 
Dear Madam,
Your most faithful and obedient Servant,
Ch. Montague.
