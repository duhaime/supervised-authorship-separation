When La Fleur came up
close to the table, and was
made to comprehend what I wanted,
he told me there were only two other
sheets of it which he had wrapt round
the stalks of a bouquet to keep it together,
which he had presented to the
demoiselle upon the boulevards—Then, 

prithee, La Fleur, said I, step back to
her to the Count de B****'s hotel,
and see if you can get—There is no
doubt of it, said La Fleur—and
away he flew. 
In a very little time the poor fellow
came back quite out of breath, with
deeper marks of disappointment in
his looks than could arise from the
simple irreparability of the fragment
—Juste ciel! in less than two minutes
that the poor fellow had taken his
last tender farewel of her, his faithless
mistress had given his gage
d' amour to one of the Count's footmen
—the footman to a young sempstress
—and the sempstress to a fidler,
with my fragment at the end of it— 

Our misfortunes were involved together
—I gave a sigh—and La Fleur
echo'd it back again to my ear— 
—How perfidious! cried La Fleur
—How unlucky! said I.— 
—I should not have been mortified,
Monsieur, quoth La Fleur, if
she had lost it—Nor I, La Fleur,
said I, had I found it. 
Whether I did or no will be seen
hereafter.
