No matter,—as an appendage to
seamstressy, the thread-paper might
be of some consequence to my mother,— 
of none to my father, as a mark in Slawkenbergius. 
Slawkenbergius in every page of
him was a rich treasury of inexhaustible
knowledge to my father,—he could not 

open him amiss; and he would often say
in closing the book, that if all the arts
and sciences in the world, with the books
which treated of them, were lost,— 
should the wisdom and policies of governments,
he would say, through disuse,
ever happen to be forgot, and all
that statesmen had wrote, or caused to be
written, upon the strong or the weak
sides of courts and kingdoms, should
they be forgot also,—and Slawkenbergius
only left,—there would be enough in him
in all conscience, he would say, to set
the world a going again. A treasure
therefore was he indeed! an institute of
all that was necessary to be known of
noses, and every thing else,—at matin,
noon, and vespers was Hafen Slawkenbergius
his recreation and delight: 'twas
for ever in his hands,—you would have
sworn, Sir, it had been a canon's prayer-book,
—so worn, so glazed, so contrited 

and attrited was it with fingers and with
thumbs in all its parts, from one end
even unto the other. 
I am not such a bigot to Slawkenbergius,
as my father;—there is a fund in
him, no doubt; but in my opinion, the
best, I don't say the most profitable,
but the most amusing part of Hafen
Slawkenbergius, is his tales,—and, considering
he was a German, many of them
told not without fancy:—these take up
his second book, containing nearly one
half of his folio, and are comprehended
in ten decads, each decad containing ten
tales. ——Philosophy is not built upon
tales; and therefore 'twas certainly wrong
in Slawkenbergius to send them into the
world by that name;—there are a few of
them in his eight, ninth, and tenth decads,
which I own seem rather playful and sportive,
than speculative,—but in general 

they are to be looked upon by the learned
as a detail of so many independent
facts, all of them turning round somehow
or other upon the main hinges of his
subject, and collected by him with great
fidelity, and added to his work as so many
illustrations upon the doctrines of
noses. 
As we have leisure enough upon our
hands,—if you give me leave, madam,
I'll tell you the ninth tale of his tenth
decad.
