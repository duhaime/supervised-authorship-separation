It was like the momentary contest
in the moist eye-lids of an April
morning, “Whether Bridget should
laugh or cry.” 
She snatch'd up a rolling-pin— 
'twas ten to one, she had laugh'd— 
She laid it down—she cried; and
had one single tear of 'em but tasted of
bitterness, full sorrowful would the Corporal's
heart have been that he had used
the argument; but the Corporal understood
the sex, a quart major to a terce at
least, better than my uncle Toby, and
accordingly he assailed Mrs. Bridget after
this manner. 

I know, Mrs. Bridget, said the Corporal,
giving her a most respectful kiss,
that thou art good and modest by nature,
and art withal so generous a girl in thyself,
that if I know thee rightly, thou wouldst
not wound an insect, much less the honour
of so gallant and worthy a soul as my
master, wast thou sure to be made a
countess of—but thou hast been
set on, and deluded, dear Bridget, as is
often a woman's case, “to please others
more than themselves—” 
Bridget's eyes poured down at the
sensations the Corporal excited. 
—Tell me—tell me then, my
dear Bridget, continued the Corporal,
taking hold of her hand, which hung 

down dead by her side,—and giving a
second kiss—whose suspicion has
misled thee? 
Bridget sobb'd a sob or two—then
open'd her eyes—the Corporal wiped
'em with the bottom of her apron— 
she then open'd her heart and told
him all.
