I had counted twenty pulsations,
and was going on fast towards
the fortieth, when her husband coming
unexpected from a back parlour
into the shop, put me a little out in
my reckoning. —'Twas no body but
her husband, she said—so I began a
fresh score —Monsieur is so good,
quoth she, as he pass'd by us, as to
give himself the trouble of feeling
my pulse —The husband took off his
hat, and making me a bow, said, I
did him too much honour—and having 

said that, he put on his hat and
walk'd out. 
Good God! said I to myself, as
he went out—and can this man be
the husband of this woman? 
Let it not torment the few who
know what must have been the
grounds of this exclamation, if I explain
it to those who do not. 
In London a shopkeeper and a
shopkeeper's wife seem to be one
bone and one flesh: in the several
endowments of mind and body, sometimes
the one, sometimes the other
has it, so as in general to be upon a
par, and to tally with each other as
nearly as man and wife need to do. 

In Paris, there are scarce two orders
of beings more different: for
the legislative and executive powers
of the shop not resting in the husband,
he seldom comes there—in
some dark and dismal room behind,
he sits commerceless in his thrum
night-cap, the same rough son of
Nature that Nature left him. 
The genius of a people where nothing
but the monarchy is salique,
having ceded this department, with
sundry others, totally to the women
—by a continual higgling with customers
of all ranks and sizes from
morning to night, like so many rough
pebbles shook long together in a 

bag, by amicable collisions, they
have worn down their asperities and
sharp angles, and not only become
round and smooth, but will receive,
some of them, a polish like a brilliant 
—Monsieur le Mari is little better
than the stone under your feet— 
—Surely—surely man! it is not
good for thee to sit alone—thou wast
made for social intercourse and gentle
greetings, and this improvement of
our natures from it, I appeal to, as
my evidence. 
—And how does it beat, Monsieur?
said she. —With all the benignity,
said I, looking quietly in 

her eyes, that I expected —She was
going to say something civil in return
—but the lad came into the shop
with the gloves —A propos, said I; I
want a couple of pair myself.
