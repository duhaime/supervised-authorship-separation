Monsieur Dessein came
back to let us out of the
chaise, and acquaint the lady, the
Count de L&wblank;her brother was
just arrived at the hotel. Though I
had infinite good will for the lady,
I cannot say, that I rejoiced in my
heart at the event—and could not
help telling her so—for it is fatal to
a proposal, Madam, said I, that I
was going to make you— 
—You need not tell me what the
proposal was, said she, laying her 

hand upon both mine, as she interrupted
me. —A man, my good Sir,
has seldom an offer of kindness to
make to a woman, but she has a
presentiment of it some moments
before— 
Nature arms her with it, said I,
for immediate preservation —But I
think, said she, looking in my face,
I had no evil to apprehend—and to
deal frankly with you, had determined
to accept it. —If I had—(she
stopped a moment) —I believe your
good will would have drawn a story
from me, which would have made
pity the only dangerous thing in the
journey. 

In saying this, she suffered me to
kiss her hand twice, and with a look
of sensibility mixed with a concern
she got out of the chaise—and bid
adieu.
