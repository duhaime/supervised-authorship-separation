Every day for at least ten years together
did my father resolve to have
it mended,—'tis not mended yet;— 
no family but ours would have borne
with it an hour,—and what is most astonishing,
there was not a subject in the
world upon which my father was so elegant,
as upon that of door-hinges. — 
And yet at the same time, he was certainly
one of the greatest bubbles to them, I
think, that history can produce: his rhetoric
and conduct were at perpetual
handy-cuffs. —Never did the parlour-door
open—but his philosophy or his
principles fell a victim to it;—three
drops of oyl with a feather, and a smart
stroke of a hammer, had saved his honour
for ever. 

—Inconsistent soul that man is!— 
languishing under wounds, which he has
the power to heal!—his whole life a contradiction
to his knowledge!—his reason,
that precious gift of God to him—(instead
of pouring in oyl) serving but to sharpen
his sensibilities,—to multiply his pains
and render him more melancholy and uneasy
under them!—poor unhappy creature,
that he should do so!—are not
the necessary causes of misery in this life
enow, but he must add voluntary ones to
his stock of sorrow;—struggle against
evils which cannot be avoided, and submit
to others, which a tenth part of the
trouble they create him, would remove
from his heart for ever? 
By all that is good and virtuous! if
there are three drops of oyl to be got, and
a hammer to be found within ten miles 

of Shandy-Hall,—the parlour-door hinge
shall be mended this reign.
