As the passport was directed to
all lieutenant governors, governors,
and commandants of cities,
generals of armies, justiciaries, and
all officers of justice, to let Mr. Yorick,
the king's jester, and his baggage,
travel quietly along—I own the triumph
of obtaining the passport was
not a little tarnish'd by the figure I
cut in it—But there is nothing unmixt
in this world; and some of the
gravest of our divines have carried
it so far as to affirm, that enjoyment itself 

was attended even with a sigh— 
and that the greatest they knew of
terminated in a general way, in little
better than a convulsion. 
I remember the grave and learned
Bevoriskius, in his commentary upon
the generations from Adam, very
naturally breaks off in the middle of
a note to give an account to the
world of a couple of sparrows upon
the out-edge of his window, which
had incommoded him all the time he
wrote, and at last had entirely taken
him off from his genealogy. 
—'Tis strange! writes Bevoriskius; 
but the facts are certain, for I have 

had the curiosity to mark them
down one by one with my pen—but
the cock-sparrow during the little
time that I could have finished the
other half this note, has actually
interrupted me with the reiteration
of his caresses three and twenty times
and a half. 
How merciful, adds Bevoriskius,
is heaven to his creatures! 
Ill fated Yorick! that the gravest
of thy brethren should be able to
write that to the world, which stains
thy face with crimson to copy in even
thy study. 

But this is nothing to my travels
—So I twice—twice beg pardon
for it.
