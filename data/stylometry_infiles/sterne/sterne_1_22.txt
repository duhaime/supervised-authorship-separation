As La Fleur went the whole tour
of France and Italy with me,
and will be often upon the stage, I
must interest the reader a little further
in his behalf, by saying, that I
had never less reason to repent of the
impulses which generally do determine
me, than in regard to this fellow
—he was a faithful, affectionate,
simple soul as ever trudged after the
heels of a philosopher; and notwithstanding
his talents of drum-beating
and spatterdash-making, which, tho'
very good in themselves, happen'd
to be of no great service to me, yet 

was I hourly recompenced by the
festivity of his temper—it supplied
all defects —I had a constant resource
in his looks in all difficulties and distresses
of my own —I was going to
have added, of his too; but La Fleur
was out of the reach of every thing; 
for whether 'twas hunger or thirst,
or cold or nakedness, or watchings,
or whatever stripes of ill luck La
Fleur met with in our journeyings,
there was no index in his physiognomy
to point them out by—he was eternally
the same; so that if I am a piece
of a philosopher, which Satan now
and then puts it into my head I am— 
it always mortifies the pride of the
conceit, by reflecting how much I
owe to the complexional philosophy 

of this poor fellow, for shaming me
into one of a better kind. With all
this, La Fleur had a small cast of
the coxcomb—but he seemed at first
sight to be more a coxcomb of nature
than of art; and before I had been
three days in Paris with him—he
seemed to be no coxcomb at all.
