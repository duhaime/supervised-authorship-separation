When supper was over, the
old man gave a knock upon
the table with the haft of his knife
—to bid them prepare for the dance:
the moment the signal was given, the
women and girls ran all together into
a back apartment to tye up their
hair—and the young men to the door
to wash their faces, and change their
sabots; and in three minutes every
soul was ready upon a little esplanade
before the house to begin—The
old man and his wife came out last,
and, placing me betwixt them, sat
down upon a sopha of turf by the
door. 

The old man had some fifty years
ago been no mean performer upon
the vielle—and at the age he was
then of, touch'd it well enough for
the purpose. His wife sung now-and
then a little to the tune—then intermitted
—and joined her old man again
as their children and grand-children
danced before them. 
It was not till the middle of the
second dance, when, from some pauses
in the movement wherein they all
seemed to look up, I fancied I could
distinguish an elevation of spirit different
from that which is the cause or
the effect of simple jollity—In a word,
I thought I beheld Religion mixing in
the dance—but as I had never seen 

her so engaged, I should have look'd
upon it now, as one of the illusions
of an imagination which is eternally
misleading me, had not the old man,
as soon as the dance ended, said, that
this was their constant way; and that
all his life long he had made it a rule,
after supper was over, to call out his
family to dance and rejoice; believing,
he said, that a chearful and contented
mind was the best sort of thanks to
heaven that an illiterate peasant could
pay— 
—Or a learned prelate either,
said I.
