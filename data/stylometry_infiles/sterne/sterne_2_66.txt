—What a conjuncture was
here lost! —My father
in one of his best explanatory moods,— 
in eager pursuit of a metaphysic point into
the very regions where clouds and
thick darkness would soon have encompassed
it about;—my uncle Toby
in one of the finest dispositions for it in
the world;—his head like a smoak-jack; 
—the funnel unswept, and the ideas 

whirling round and round about in it,
all obfuscated and darkened over with
fuliginous matter! —By the tomb stone
of Lucian—if it is in being,—if
not, why then, by his ashes! by the ashes
of my dear Rabelais, and dearer Cervantes,
—my father and my uncle Toby's discourse
upon TIME and ETERNITY,—was
a discourse devoutly to be wished for! and
the petulancy of my father's humour in
putting a stop to it, as he did, was a
robbery of the Ontologic treasury, of such
a jewel, as no coalition of great occasions
and great men, are ever likely to restore
to it again.
