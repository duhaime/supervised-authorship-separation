When you have gained the
top of mount Taurira, you
run presently down to Lyons— 
adieu then to all rapid movements! 
'Tis a journey of caution; and it
fares better with sentiments, not to
be in a hurry with them; so I contracted
with a voiturin to take his
time with a couple of mules, and
convey me in my own chaise safe to
Turin through Savoy. 
Poor, patient, quiet, honest people!
fear not; your poverty, the
treasury of your simple virtues, will 

not be envied you by the world,
nor will your vallies be invaded by
it. —Nature! in the midst of thy disorders,
thou art still friendly to the
scantiness thou hast created—with
all thy great works about thee, little
hast thou left to give, either to the
scithe or to the sickle—but to that
little, thou grantest safety and protection; 
and sweet are the dwellings
which stand so shelter'd. 
Let the way-worn traveller vent his
complaints upon the sudden turns and
dangers of your roads—your rocks
—your precipices—the difficulties of
getting up—the horrors of getting
down—mountains impracticable— 
and cataracts, which roll down great 

stones from their summits, and block
up his road. —The peasants had been
all day at work in removing a fragment
of this kind between St. Michael and
Madane; and by the time my Voiturin
got to the place, it wanted
full two hours of compleating before
a passage could any how be
gain'd: there was nothing but to wait
with patience—'twas a wet and tempestuous
night; so that by the delay,
and that together, the voiturin
found himself obliged to take up five
miles short of his stage at a little
decent kind of an inn by the road
side. 
I forthwith took possession of my
bed-chamber—got a good fire—order'd 

supper; and was thanking
heaven it was no worse—when a
voiture arrived with a lady in it and
her servant-maid. 
As there was no other bed-chamber
in the house, the hostess, without
much nicety, led them into mine,
telling them, as she usher'd them in,
that there was no body in it but an
English gentleman—that there were
two good beds in it, and a closet within
the room which held another
—the accent in which she spoke of
this third bed did not say much for
it—however, she said, there were three
beds and but three people—and she
durst say, the gentleman would do 

any thing to accommodate matters. — 
I left not the lady a moment to make
a conjecture about it—so instantly
made a declaration I would do any
thing in my power. 
As this did not amount to an absolute
surrender of my bed-chamber,
I still felt myself so much the proprietor,
as to have a right to do the
honours of it—so I desired the lady to
sit down—pressed her into the warmest
seat—call'd for more wood—desired
the hostess to enlarge the plan of the
supper, and to favour us with the very
best wine. 
The lady had scarce warm'd herself
five minutes at the fire, before 

she began to turn her head back, and
give a look at the beds; and the
oftener she cast her eyes that way,
the more they return'd perplex'd
—I felt for her—and for myself; 
for in a few minutes, what by her
looks, and the case itself, I found myself
as much embarrassed as it was
possible the lady could be herself. 
That the beds we were to lay in
were in one and the same room, was
enough simply by itself to have excited
all this—but the position of
them, for they stood parallel, and so
very close to each other as only to
allow space for a small wicker chair
betwixt them, render'd the affair 

still more oppressive to us—they were
fixed up moreover near the fire, and
the projection of the chimney on one
side, and a large beam which cross'd
the room on the other, form'd a kind
of recess for them that was no way
favourable to the nicety of our sensations
—if any thing could have
added to it, it was, that the two beds
were both of 'em so very small, as to
cut us off from every idea of the lady
and the maid lying together; which
in either of them, could it have been
feasible, my lying besides them,
tho' a thing not to be wish'd, yet
there was nothing in it so terrible
which the imagination might not have
pass'd over without torment. 

As for the little room within, it
offer'd little or no consolation to us; 
'twas a damp cold closet, with a half
dismantled window shutter, and with
a window which had neither glass or
oil paper in it to keep out the tempest
of the night. I did not endeavour
to stifle my cough when the
lady gave a peep into it; so it reduced
the case in course to this alternative
—that the lady should sacrifice her
health to her feelings, and take up
with the closet herself, and abandon
the bed next mine to her maid, or
that the girl should take the closet,
&c. &c. 
The lady was a Piedmontese of
about thirty, with a glow of health 

in her cheeks: the maid was a
Lyonoise of twenty, and as brisk and
lively a French girl as ever moved. — 
There were difficulties every way— 
and the obstacle of the stone in the
road, which brought us into the distress,
great as it appeared whilst the
peasants were removing it, was but
a pebble to what lay in our ways
now—I have only to add, that it
did not lessen the weight which hung
upon our spirits, that we were both
too delicate to communicate what
we felt to each other upon the occasion. 
We sat down to supper; and had
we not had more generous wine to it
than a little inn in Savoy could have 

furnish'd, our tongues had been
tied up, till necessity herself had set
them at liberty—but the lady having
a few bottles of Burgundy in her
voiture sent down her fille de
chambre for a couple of them; so
that by the time supper was over, and
we were left alone, we felt ourselves
inspired with a strength of mind sufficient
to talk, at least, without reserve
upon our situation. We turn'd
it every way, and debated and considered
it in all kind of lights in the
course of a two hours negociation; at
the end of which the articles were
settled finally betwixt us, and stipulated
for in form and manner of a treaty
of peace—and I believe with as much 

religion and good faith on both sides,
as in any treaty which as yet had the
honour of being handed down to posterity. 
They were as follows: 
First. As the right of the bedchamber
is in Monsieur, and he
thinking the bed next to the fire to
be the warmest, he insists upon the
concession on the lady's side of taking
up with it. 
Granted, on the part of Madame; 
with a proviso, That as the curtains
of that bed are of a flimsy transparent
cotton, and appear likewise
too scanty to draw close, that the 

fille de chambre, shall fasten up the
opening, either by corking pins, or
needle and thread, in such manner
as shall be deemed a sufficient barrier
on the side of Monsieur. 
2dly. It is required on the part of
Madame, that Monsieur shall lay the
whole night through in his robe de
chambre. 
Rejected: inasmuch Monsieur is
not worth a robe de chambre; he
having nothing in his portmanteau
but six shirts and a black silk pair of
breeches. 
The mentioning the silk pair of
breeches made an entire change of
the article—for the breeches were accepted 

as an equivalent for the robe
de chambre; and so it was stipulated
and agreed upon that I should lay in
my black silk breeches all night. 
3dly. It was insisted upon, and stipulated
for by the lady, that after
Monsieur was got to bed, and the
candle and fire extinguished, that
Monsieur should not speak one single
word the whole night. 
Granted; provided Monsieur's saying
his prayers might not be deem'd
an infraction of the treaty. 
There was but one point forgot in
this treaty, and that was the manner
in which the lady and myself should 

be obliged to undress and get to bed
—there was but one way of doing it,
and that I leave to the reader to devise; 
protesting as I do it, that if it
is not the most delicate in nature, 'tis
the fault of his own imagination— 
against which this is not my first
complaint. 
Now, when we were got to bed,
whether it was the novelty of the
situation, or what it was, I know not,
but so it was, I could not shut my
eyes; I tried this side and that, and
turn'd and turn'd again, till a full
hour after midnight, when Nature
and patience both wearing out—O
my God! said I— 
—You have broke the treaty,
Monsieur, said the lady, who had no 

more slept than myself. —I begg'd a
thousand pardons, but insisted it was
no more than an ejaculation—she maintain'd
'twas an entire infraction of
the treaty—I maintain'd it was provided
for in the clause of the third
article. 
The lady would by no means give
up her point, tho' she weakened her
barrier by it; for in the warmth of the
dispute, I could hear two or three
corking pins fall out of the curtain
to the ground. 
Upon my word and honour, Madame,
said I—stretching my arm
out of bed, by way of asseveration— 

—(I was going to have added, that
I would not have trespass'd against
the remotest idea of decorum for
the world)— 
—But the fille de chambre hearing
there were words between us, and fearing
that hostilities would ensue in
course, had crept silently out of her closet,
and it being totally dark, had stolen
so close to our beds, that she had got
herself into the narrow passage which
separated them, and had advanc'd so
far up as to be in a line betwixt her
mistress and me— 
So that when I stretch'd out my
hand, I caught hold of the fille de
chambre's.
