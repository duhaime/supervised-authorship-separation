We get forwards in the world
not so much by doing services,
as receiving them: you take a
withering twig, and put it in the
ground; and then you water it, because
you have planted it. 
Monsieur le Count de B****,
merely because he had done me one
kindness in the affair of my passport,
would go on and do me another,
the few days he was at Paris, in
making me known to a few people
of rank; and they were to present
me to others, and so on. 

I had got master of my secret, just
in time to turn these honours to some
little account; otherwise, as is commonly
the case, I should have din'd or
supp'd a single time or two round,
and then by translating French looks
and attitudes into plain English, I
should presently have seen, that I had
got hold of the couvert*  of some
more entertaining guest; and in
course, should have resigned all my
places one after another, merely upon
the principle that I could not keep
them. —As it was, things did not go
much amiss. 
I had the honour of being introduced
to the old Marquis de B****: 

in days of yore he had signaliz'd
himself by some small feats of chivalry
in the Cour d'amour, and had
dress'd himself out to the idea of
tilts and tournaments ever since—the
Marquis de B**** wish'd to have
it thought the affair was somewhere
else than in his brain. “He could
like to take a trip to England,” and
ask'd much of the English ladies. 
Stay where you are, I beseech you,
Mons. le Marquise, said I—Les
Messrs. Angloise can scarce get a
kind look from them as it is. —The
Marquis invited me to supper. 
Mons. P****, the farmer general,
was just as inquisitive about our
taxes—They were very considerable, 

he heard—If we knew but how to
collect them, said I, making him a
low bow. 
I could never have been invited to
Mons. P****'s concerts upon any
other terms. 
I had been misrepresented to Madame
de Q**** as an esprit— 
Madame de Q**** was an esprit
herself; she burnt with impatience
to see me, and hear me talk. I had
not taken my seat, before I saw she
did not care a sous whether I had any
wit or no—I was let in, to be convinced
she had. —I call heaven to
witness I never once open'd the
door of my lips. 

Madame de Q*** vow'd to every
creature she met, “She had never
had a more improving conversation
with a man in her life.” 
There are three epochas in the
empire of a French-woman—She is
coquette—then deist—then devôte:
the empire during these is nevet lost
—she only changes her subjects:
when thirty-five years and more
have unpeopled her dominions of the
slave of love, she re-peoples it with
slaves of infidelity—and then with
the slaves of the Church. 
Madame de V*** was vibrating
betwixt the first of these epochas:
the colour of the rose was shading 

fast away—she ought to have been
a deist five years before the time I
had the honour to pay my first visit. 
She placed me upon the same sopha
with her, for the sake of disputing
the point of religion more closely. 
—In short, Madame de V*** told
me she believed nothing. 
I told Madame de V*** it might
be her principle; but I was sure it
could not be her interest to level the
outworks, without which I could
not conceive how such a citadel as
hers could be defended—that there
was not a more dangerous thing in
the world, than for a beauty to be a
deist—that it was a debt I owed my 

creed, not to conceal it from her— 
that I had not been five minutes sat
upon the sopha besides her, but I had
begun to form designs—and what is
it, but the sentiments of religion,
and the persuasion they had existed
in her breast, which could have
check'd them as they rose up. 
We are not adamant, said I, taking
hold of her hand—and there is need
of all restraints, till age in her own
time steals in and lays them on us— 
but, my dear lady, said I, kissing her
hand—'tis too—too soon— 
I declare I had the credit all over
Paris of unperverting Madame de
V***. —She affirmed to Mons. 

D*** and the Abbe M***, that in
one half hour I had said more for
revealed religion, than all their Encyclopedia
had said against it—I was
listed directly into Madame de V***'s
Coterie—and she put of the epocha
of deism for two years. 
I remember it was in this Coterie,
in the middle of a discourse, in which
I was shewing the necessity of a first
cause, that the young Count de Faineant
took me by the hand to the
furthest corner of the room, to tell
me my solitaire was pinn'd too strait
about my neck—It should be plus
badinant, said the Count, looking
down upon his own—But a word,
Mons. Yorick, to the wise— 

—And from the wise, Mons. le
Count, replied I, making him a
bow—is enough. 
The Count de Faineant embraced
me with more ardour than ever I was
embraced by mortal man. 
For three weeks together, I was
of every man's opinion I met. — 
Pardi! ce Mons. Yorick a autant
d'esprit que nous autres. —Il raisonne
bien, said another. —C'est
un bon enfant, said a third. —And
at this price I could have eaten
and drank and been merry all the
days of my life at Paris; but 'twas a
dishonest reckoning—I grew ashamed
of it—it was the gain of a slave— 

every sentiment of honour revolted
against it—the higher I got, the
more was I forced upon my beggarly
system—the better the Coterie—the
mere children of Art—I languish'd
for those of Nature: and one night,
after a most vile prostitution of myself
to half a dozen different people,
I grew sick—went to bed—order'd
La Fleur to get me horses in the
morning to set out for Italy.
