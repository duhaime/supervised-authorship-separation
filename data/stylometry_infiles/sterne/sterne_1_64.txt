I stepp'd hastily after him: it was
the very man whose success in
asking charity of the women before
the door of the hotel had so puzzled
me—and I found at once his secret,
or at least the basis of it—'twas
flattery. 
Delicious essence! how refreshing
art thou to nature! how strongly are
all its powers and all its weaknesses
on thy side! how sweetly dost thou
mix with the blood, and help it
through the most difficult and tortuous
passages to the heart! 

The poor man, as he was not
straighten'd for time, had given it
here in a larger dose: 'tis certain
he had a way of bringing it into less
form, for the many sudden cases, he
had to do with in the streets; but
how he contrived to correct, sweeten,
concentre, and qualify it, I vex not
my spirit with the inquiry—it is
enough, the beggar gain'd two
twelve-sous pieces—and they can best
tell the rest, who have gain'd much
greater matters by it.
