Yes—and then—Ye whose
clay-cold heads and luke-warm
hearts can argue down or mask your
passions, tell me, what trespass is it
that man should have them? or how
his spirit stands answerable to the
father of spirits, but for his conduct
under them? 
If nature has so wove her web of
kindness, that some threads of love
and desire are entangled with the
piece, must the whole web be rent in
drawing them out? —Whip me such
stoics, great governor of nature! 

said I to myself—Wherever thy providence
shall place me for the trials of
my virtue—whatever is my danger
—whatever is my situation—let me
feel the movements which rise out of
it, and which belong to me as a man,
and if I govern them as a good
one, I will trust the issues to thy
justice—for thou hast made us, and
not we ourselves. 
As I finish'd my address, I raised
the fair fille de chambre up by the
hand, and led her out of the room
—she stood by me till I lock'd the
door and put the key in my pocket
—and then—the victory being
quite decisive—and not till then, I 

press'd my lips to her cheek, and,
taking her by the hand again,
led her safe to the gate of the
hotel.
