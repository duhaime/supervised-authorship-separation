Madam,
As I was extreamly confus'd to
find my little Novel presenting
itself to your Ladyship without
your Leave or Knowledge, so I
am as much delighted in having Permission
to lay this large Composure at your Ladyship's
Feet, by which Means I have the
Opportunity to beg Pardon for the Offences committed by the other (which I do
with all Humility) tho' I was not guilty,
nor can conceive by what Concurrence of
Mistakes it so happen'd, unless design'd
by Fate to render your Ladyship's Goodness
the more conspicuous, in pardoning 
those Indecorums and Breaches of Respect,
always due to Persons of your Quality
and Merit, but especially on such Occasions. 
Madam, it was this profound Respect
which has long oppos'd my addressing to you
in this Kind; and which, I believe, would
have wholly suppress'd all such Thoughts
in me as too arrogant, but that I was encourag'd
by casting an Eye on that great
Wit, worthy of his Time, Sir Philip
Sidney, whose Steps, with awful Distance,
I now take Leave to trace; and
beg this may find the same Acceptance
thro' your Goodness, as his found thro' its
own Merit; and then I am sure my Roman
Heroes will be as safe in the Protection
of the Countess of Exeter, as his Arcadians
were in that of the Countess of Pembroke. 
Your Ladyship's Virtue and Prudence having
gain'd so absolute an Empire over
the Hearts of the World, that none can
reject what you are pleas'd to approve, nor
slight what you are pleas'd to encourage:
So that one gracious Look from your Ladyship
will raise my Exilius from his
Dust, and make him live; live in the
Hearts of all the Fair, and in the Esteem
of all his own Sex, 'till they make his unfashionable
Constancy become the newest
Mode, by their wearing it, in practising 
what they have so long exploded and ridiculed. 
Thus it is in your Ladyship's Power to
reform the World, and restore heroic Love
to its ancient Jurisdiction. It is in your
Power, Madam, to dissipate all those Clouds
of Tribulation which encircled these my
Roman Lovers, from the Time of their Separation
at Rome, 'till their Return to their
Father's House in the Country. 
And now, Madam, give me Leave to
pause a littleâ€”Was it not Burleigh house,
with its Park, Shades, and Walks, that
form'd in me the first Idea of my Scipio's
Country Retreat? Most sure it was; for
when I compos'd my Romance, I knew nothing
farther from Home than Burleigh and
Worthorp. And 'tis as true, that those bright
Heroines I have endeavour'd to characterize,
are but some faint Resemblances of
the noble Ladies, who inhabited those
stately Palaces; amongst whom none has
been a greater Ornament to this noble
Family than your Ladyship. I dare not
enter upon the Particulars of those Perfections
which charm all that know you,
lest I should lessen what I most desire to
commend, they being above my Capacity; 
and tho' this be the common Excuse of all
defective Writers, yet, I rather chuse that
beaten Tract, than deviate into Complements,
which my Education renders me 
uncapable to perform; therefore shall conclude
with the Words of that great Sage; 
Many Daughters have done virtuously, But thou
excellest them all: Chiefly in Humility and
Condescention, in raising me from my Obscurity,
to the Honour of subscribing my
self, with profound Respect, 
Madam,
Your Ladyship's most humble,
And most obedient Servant, 
Jane Barker.
