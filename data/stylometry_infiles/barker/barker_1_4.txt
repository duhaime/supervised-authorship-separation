Night having withdrawn her
sable Curtains, discover'd the
bright Aurora rising, whose
Beauty illustrated the whole
Hemisphere, and thereby excited Clelia,
the fair Niece of Publius Scipio, to her early
Devotions, in a Grove near her Uncle
Scipio's House, where stood a Chapel dedicated 
to the Goddess of the Morning. After
which, she took a Walk in the Grove,
for the Pleasure of the cool Morning Air,
perfum'd with the natural Product of the
Earth; as also to hear the Musick of the
winged Choiresters, whose wild Notes were
no less delightful than those well-compos'd
Ayres, sung in Honour of the aforesaid
Goddess. Here she had not took many
Turns, but, lifting up her Eyes, she saw a
Youth in the Habit of a Page approaching
her; who, coming near, cast his Arms
about her Neck, saying, My dear Clelia,
what Happiness have I to meet thee here! 
Clelia, both angry and astonish'd, gave him
a Reprimand suitable to his Crime and
her own Indignation; at which, the Youth
pulling off some little Disguise, said, Dear
Cousin, behold your affectionate Kinswoman
Scipiana! At which, Clelia, quite transported
with Joy, embrac'd her with all the
Tenderness that Love and Excess of Satisfaction
could produce; then seating themselves,
Clelia desir'd Scipiana to inform her
the Cause of her long Absence, and how
she came thus metamorphos'd. To which
Scipiana answer'd, That her Adventures
were so many, as would make the History
too long to recite at that Time; therefore
begg'd Clelia rather to let her know what
had attended her since their Separation at
Rome, and what Turns of Fortune had 
brought her into the Country, a Place and
Station of Life so little agreeable to her
Inclinations, or, more properly speaking,
which was so much her Aversion. To
which Clelia readily accorded, and concluding
it too early to present Scipiana to
her Father, thereby to disturb his Morning
Repose, they entertain'd themselves
in the following Relation. 
The History of Clelia.
You know, Madam, said Clelia, that
I always liv'd at Rome, under the
Conduct of my wise and honourable Parents,
the noble Fabius, my Father, and the
virtuous Cornelia, my Mother, your illustrious
Aunt; a Lady truly honourable in
her Birth, Marriage, and all the Actions
of her Life. Here I had the Happiness to
enjoy your Company sometimes, tho' not
so often as my Love and Esteem made me
desire; for this charming Solitude, in
which you delighted, depriv'd me and the
rest of your Friends of that Felicity. The
last Time was at the Triumph of your
Brother, the incomparable Asiaticus, after
his Asian Conquest, which was the greatest
Augmentation of the Roman Glory that
ever Hero yet acquir'd: And as it gave a
most sensible Joy to all honourable Minds,
so, more especially to us the near Relations 
of the Conqueror. Nevertheless, this happy
Time was the Beginning of my Misfortunes; 
for I being with you, amongst
the rest of the Roman Ladies, to make our
Complements to the Triumpher, according
to the Roman Custom, I was surpriz'd at
the graceful Mien of Marcellus, who regarded
me with an Air so full of Respect
and Gallantry, as if he dedicated to me
all the Part he had in that Day's Solemnity. 
At least, I flatter'd myself with
this Opinion; and I fear this is a Fault
which Maids of all Ranks are too often
guilty of; we take Complements for Kindness,
Kindness for Affection, Affection for
Passion, and so on, 'till we too late find our
Mistake, and know that Self-flattery, and
a secret Belief of our own Merits, betray
us more than those we call False Lovers. 
Next Day after the Triumph, you may
remember, Madam, that you and I went
to render our Respects to Asiaticus, where
resorted all the Ladies, as well as the great
Commanders of the Army, paying him
the Honours of a happy Conqueror and a
glorious Triumpher. Asiaticus, according
to his accustom'd Generosity, attributed all
to their Courage; so, making them partake
of the Honours they offer'd him. To which
Marcellus merrily answer'd, That they ought
not to ascribe too much to their Swords in
the Presence of Ladies, whose Eyes were 
capable of making greater Conquests than
the Empire of Asia. To which I reply'd,
That if we were all bright as Jemella, and
our Enemies amorous as Marcellus, we
might pretend to subdue the Universe; 
for their Marriage being no Way a Secret,
I thought one might name her in Publick
without Breach of Civility. To which
Marcellus made several Returns, by Way of
Railery, saying, That Jemella's early Beauty
was very bright; yet, when the Sun
rises, we cease to adore the Morning Star,
having a more illustrious Object for our
Adorations. In this Kind of Prattle we
entertain'd our selves, whilst Asiaticus was
speaking much in Favour of a certain Stranger,
who had done Things very extraordinary
in that Expedition. 'Tis true, reply'd
Scipiana, I remember my Brother spake
much in Commendation of an unknown
Person, in Terms so advantageous, as seem'd
rather the Effect of his Generosity than
the Stranger's Merit; for you know my
Brother is endow'd with that excellent
Quality in a peculiar Manner; but Time
and divers Occasions have taught me that
this Stranger's Worth needed not those
Commendations which proceed from Generosity,
bare Justice giving him the Character
of a compleat Hero, as I shall hereafter
inform you; but at present beg you
to proceed in your Discourse. 
Madam, said Clelia, it is not proper for
me to describe to you any of the Grandeur
or Magnificence of Rome at that Time,
your self being a Spectator, or rather, your
Beauty and Merit making a principal Part
of the Solemnity. 
When the Time prescrib'd had put a Period
to these glorious Diversions, and that
we were ready to attend your Ladyship,
together with Asiaticus, to this your Father's
Country-House, here to celebrate the Marriage
between you and my Brother Fabius,
according to the Agreement and Desire of
our Relations on all Sides; you may
please to remember how Fabius, being
wounded in the Street, the Night before
our intended Journey, was detain'd, and
I with him, to attend his Recovery. We
suppos'd that my Brother receiv'd this
Wound from the Hand of that lewd Wretch
Clodius, because he has never been seen at
Rome since. True, reply'd Scipiana, it was
Clodius did that unworthy Action; for he
has avow'd as much to me since, which
renders him so perfectly my Aversion,
that I can hardly repeat his Name with
common Patience, nor think on him but
with a sensible Indignation. But I will
not enlarge at present, thereby to deprive
myself a Moment of that Discourse I
have begg'd of my dear Clelia. 
Whilst my Brother's Wound detain'd him
(said Clelia) Marcellus made divers Visits,
partly out of Respect and Kindness to him,
and partly to find an Opportunity to discover
his Passion to me, which in a few Days
happen'd. Fabius being asleep, I was retir'd
into the Closet, where Marcellus entering,
took the Opportunity to cast himself
at my Feet, and make his Address to
me with all the Tenderness that a Respect
due to my Quality could permit, and the
Suddenness of the Occasion dictate: Which
I receiv'd with a pretended Displeasure, as
counting it an Affront to my Virtue, that
he, being espous'd to another, should offer
me his Love; to which he return'd, (with
much Patience) that a Marriage made in
Minority, and never consummated, was
nothing in Effect, and such was that between
him and Jemella; which I knew
very well without his Information:
But the Consideration of the many Difficulties
that wou'd arise by Means of this Contract
with Jemella, made me oppose him, not
only in this first Onset, but in divers other
Attacks of that Kind. Nor was it only
this Chaos of Confusion, which I knew must
necessarily fall between these three noble
Houses, but my virtuous generous Soul
had an Aversion to any indirect Proceeding,
and my own Heart told me in what
Manner Jemella must resent such an Affront; 
yet these, and many more reasonable
Considerations cou'd not hinder some
tender Thoughts from taking Root in my
Heart, which have since brought forth such
Fruits of Folly, as I shall let you know
in the Sequel. I will not repeat to you,
Madam, the divers Conflicts of my Thoughts
and the Agitation of my Mind on this Occasion; 
for my Interior labour'd as it were
under a Fever and Ague, burning with an
irresistible Inclination for Marcellus, and
trembling with the Apprehension of so irregular
an Affection, of which I saw no
Possibility of Cure, but by the immediate
Help of the Powers Divine; for which
Cause I went to the High Priest of Jupiter,
my particular Friend; to him I open'd my
Heart, and begg'd his holy Aid and Counsel; 
who advis'd me to make my Devotions
in the Temple of Jupiter, where many
had been favour'd with satisfactory
Answers. This Counsel I put in Practice
as soon as possible, and having perform'd
my Sacrifice with all due Ceremony, the
Oracle answer'd, 

The Gods will never disapprove
The sacred Bonds of mutual Love.

Having receiv'd this Answer, and the
Benediction of the High Priest, I turn'd
my self to go away, and thereupon discover'd 
the Face of a certain Person, who
had lain before the Altar all the Time of
the Service in great Devotion. This Person,
notwithstanding the Disguise he wore, I
knew to be Marcellus, and he as soon knew
me thro' the Veil with which I was cover'd,
and accompanying me out of the Temple,
he fail'd not to enforce the propitious Answer
of the Gods, to justify his Pretensions,
and obtain my Consent, which, embellish'd
by his Wit and Gallantry, put me so far
to a Non-plus, I scarce knew what to reply; 
only I told him, that what soever the
Gods might seem to consent to in their dubious
Oracles, a young Lady ought to interpret
their Meaning according to the
Dictates of filial Obedience, and to have
no other Will but that of her Parents. In
this Answer I did, as it were, give my
Consent; nor could I longer support my
pretended Dislike of his Passion, after having
been discover'd soliciting the Gods
for that Purpose. 
Marcellus having gain'd this Point, lost
no Opportunity to ask me of my Father; 
for the same Day coming to visit my Brother,
he found my Father by the Bed-side,
who began to rally at the young Gallants
of the Age, who were so cold in their
Amours, and by that Means gave Opportunity
to their Rivals to enterprize against
them; even you, Marcellus (continued he) 
will delay your Time, 'till some keen-bladed
Rival lay you in your Bed, like
Fabius. To which Marcellus reply'd, (with
more Affection than Prudence) saying, My
Lord, I want but your Consent to secure
me from that Danger; for, had I that, I
might hope the fair Clelia and I might be
so far united as to prevent all designing
Rivals. This unexpected Answer not only
surpriz'd, but highly displeas'd my Father,
in Consideration of Jemella, whom all the
World look'd upon as Wife to Marcellus; so
consequently deem'd himself affronted, and
me dishonour'd in this Address; wherefore
he charg'd Marcellus never to come near
me, and forbid me all Correspondence with
him; in which my Mother co operating, I
was a kind of Prisoner at large, under their
diligent Observation. Moreover, to render
the Proceeding throughly just and honourable,
my Father advertised my Lord
Marcellus, Father to my Lover, and Lucullus,
Father to Jemella. For which Cause
Marcellus confin'd his Son to his Apartment,
consulting in the mean Time with
Lucullus what Measures to take in this Affair. 
I at the same Time suffer'd much
in the Reproaches made me by my Father,
Mother, and Brother, for having forgot
mine own Honour, and the Honour of my
Family, in entertaining a secret Amour,
and that too, with one espoused to another; 
which Reprimands I must needs
own were no more than the Crime deserv'd,
and very suitable to those strict Rules of
Virtue and Honour they always practis'd,
and in which they instructed me their dear
Disciple and darling Daughter. Now,
tho' Reason oblig'd me to receive these
Reproofs with Moderation and Respect,
yet the Tenderness I had for Marcellus
made me so far transgress my Duty, as to
find out Opportunities to correspond with
him by Letters, Presents, Messages, and
the like; which was not hard to do, by
Reason the Domesticks on both Sides were
subservient to our Inclinations. This kind
of secret Correspondence to me now appears
so great a Fault in a young Lady,
that I can never forgive myself, therefore
wonder not if my Friends remain disoblig'd; 
for tho' the Intercourse be never so
innocent, and the Design never so honourable,
(as was this between me and Marcellus)
yet it carries with it such an Umbrage
of Unworthiness, as extremely clouds and
disfigures a Lady's Reputation, in the Opinion
of all, even the most kind and generous
Part of the World, but egregiously in
the malicious and censorious Part of Mankind. 
However, this pass'd not long undiscover'd
by our vigilant Parents; wherefore
my Father, all on a sudden, took me
in his Chariot, and brought me hither, not 
letting me know it was my Uncle's House,
lest I should advertise Marcellus of the Place
of my Residence; at the same Time giving
out that I was gone into Egypt, to my
Aunt Fabiell, who is there marry'd to a
Prince of the Blood Royal of the Ptolomy's. 
After a few Days, my Uncle came to me,
and let me know that it was in his House in
which I was detain'd. He encourag'd and
promis'd me all Kindness, assuring himself
I would act nothing contrary to Duty and
Honour; so, leading me out of the little
Captivity of my Chamber, gave me the
Command of his House and Family. 
At this Time it was, that we heard the
fatal News of your being lost, as also your
Brother, the Noble Asiaticus, and that my
Brother Fabius had left Rome, and was gone
in Search after you; of all which we never
since heard any Tidings. My good Uncle,
your Father, was pleas'd to say, his Affliction
was extremely mitigated by my
being with him, which I count the Effect
of his Goodness; but I am sure his Wisdom,
Patience, and Resignation under his Sufferings,
have been such Lectures to me, as
I hope I never shall forget; for as none
ever experienc'd the Mutability of human
Affairs more throughly than my Uncle, so
none ever bore it with a greater Equanimity
of Mind, in which he demonstrated himself
a true noble Roman, well deserving 
the worthy Character he had acquir'd,
whose Virtue is built on such strong Bases,
as the Shocks of Fortune cannot move,
much less overthrow: Nevertheless, he is
a Mortal, not a Deity, and human Nature
wou'd oftentimes exert its Right in many
Tears and Lamentations for your Loss,
and the Loss of the illustrious Asiaticus. 
Whilst I join'd my Griefs here with my
Uncle, Marcellus remain'd still at Rome,
detain'd in his Father's House. Now hearing
of my being gone into Egypt, he began
to be out of Patience at his Confinement,
it putting him out of all Possibility of following
me; and finding no Means to accomplish
his enlargement but by addressing
himself to the Senate, he was forc'd to put
even that in Execution, tho' otherwise
very unwilling to make publick the private
Animosities between him and his Father. 
Whilst this was in Debate in the
Senate, the Rabble of Rome, who readily
entertain any Pretext for Mutiny, assembled
themselves about the Capitol, demanded
Justice, declaring that they wou'd not
suffer a young Nobleman, who had serv'd
so bravely in the War, to be oppress'd, or
constrain'd by the Caprice of a covetous
Father, and such kind of Insolence, suitable
to a Mob, the most ungovernable
Part of the Creation, who have no Law
but their Will, and their Will prompted 
by their irregular Appetites, or Fancies; 
yet these are too often the Legislators of
our State, which is the greatest Misfortune
belonging to a Government. 
You know, Madam, (continu'd Clelia)
that Marcellus never valu'd the Honour of
a popular Applause, as knowing it proceeds
from Humour or Passion, not the
Merit of the Person to whom they pretend
to direct it; but especially, their Kindness
was now ungrateful to him, fearing it
might displease as well as expose me, and
irritate my Father against him; however,
it had its Effect; for the Senate, whether
unwilling to displease the Mob, or willing
to please Marcellus, gave him his Liberty,
which he soon employ'd in going to find me
out in Egypt, as believing me really to be
gone thither. In Order to this, he took his
Journey towards Cajeta, a Port near this
Place, and most commodious for a Voyage
into Egypt; but so it fell out, that he lost his
Way in the Night, and arriv'd here, he
being in disguise, thereby the better to
avoid any Opposition in his Passage that
might be made by the Practice of his Father,
or Lucullus, Jemella's Father. 
In this Transaction I cannot but reflect
with Veneration on the Providence of the
Gods, and the Care of our good Genius,
who, unknown to our selves, and often
against our Wills, mislead us (if I may so 
say) into the right Way, and conduct us
thro' unknown Paths, to what we desire,
or, at least, to what is best for us, whilst
our own blind Will, or rather our purblind
Reason, wou'd serve only to train us
into inextricable Labyrinths of Difficulties
and Confusion. How useful then, and
beneficial is the Virtue of Resignation, and
entire Submission to the Powers divine? 
But to return to Marcellus, to whom belongs
the Application. He was kindly entertain'd
by my Uncle's Servants, and by
Chance was put to lodge in an Apartment
which extended itself near mine; tho' the
Passage by which one enters be far distant. 
Here it was he heard me talk to my Maids,
and knew my Voice so well, as to be convinc'd
of my being there, which put a Period
to his intended Voyage into Egypt. 
Next Morning he walk'd forth into this
Grove, full of an unquiet Satisfaction, for
having found me there, he was ignorant how
to come to see or speak to me. Walking
thus musing, and casting many Things in
his Mind, he at last found at the other Side of
the Grove a little House, which he thought
might be subservient to his Purpose, and
therefore hired it of my Uncle's Steward,
and in a few Days, according to his Wish,
met me in these Walks, for I come here
very often to adore the Goddess Aurora at
the Morning Sacrifice. It was in that little 
Chapel that I saw and knew him, notwithstanding
his Disguise; for, the very
first Glance of his Eyes discover'd him to
be the whole Marcellus, the brave, the
amorous Marcellus; and I, no Doubt, as
soon discover'd my self to be the tender,
overjoy'd Clelia. I cannot but take Notice,
how, by divine Providence, we now
met a second Time in Devotion, and our
Hearts discover'd their tender Sentiments
twice unawares before the Altar of the
Gods, which I apply'd according to the
Dictates of Inclination, and so believ'd it
to be a Mark that the Gods were favourable
to, and approv'd of, this our Amour, and
in the End would bless it with Success. 
I soon gave him Opportunity to speak to
me, in which he most instantly begg'd me
to conceal his being there, 'till by the Intercession
of his Friends he had treated with
the Senate, and Jemella's Parents about the
Breach of that Contract made in their
Minority, which would be better accomplish'd
in his Absence, all the World believing
him gone into Egypt. I confiding
in his Truth and Sincerity, promis'd him
all Secrecy; he in the mean Time pretending
to my Uncle's Servants, and those
Country People with whom Necessity oblig'd
him to converse, that he was a young Officer
of the Army, that left the World out
of Devotion, and there try'd to accustom 
himself to a solitary Life, in Contemplation
of the celestial Beings, which indeed
was partly true; for he furnish'd himself
with many devout Books, in which, no
Doubt, he meditated; and for his Recreation
he had his Musick, of which, you
know, he is a great Master. I saw him as
often as I could in the little Chapel, and
sometimes in the Walks, where he found
Opportunities to give me Letters, containing
large Accounts of his Passion, to which
I made him some Answers in Writing, for
we cou'd not correspond verbally, or, at
least, but very little without Suspicion. 
Thus, my dear Scipiana, I gave under my
own Hand the Certificates of my Folly,
and sign'd the Testimonials of my Indiscretion; 
for sure there is not a greater Imprudence,
than for a young Lady to write
to her Lover: I am now sensible it never
ought to be done, no, not even on the Account
of Denials or Reprimands, much less
to give any Assurance of Kindness; for
many Lovers aim no farther than to obtain
these Marks of Conquest, that among
their Companions, they may triumph in
shewing these Trophies of their Victory,
at least, the following Part of Marcellus's
Actions seem to evince this Assertion. 
A certain Widow Lady, nam'd Libidinia,
living near this Place, my intimate Friend,
and the Confident of my Love, gave me 
divers little discreet Hints of his Inconstancy, which I must have understood perfectly
if my Reason had not been rock'd
asleep with a full Perswasion of his Virtue. 
She often remonstrated to me the Falshood
of the Sex, the Satisfaction they took in
betraying ours; that the Vanity of boasting
their Conquest, was more pleasing to
'em than the Conquest itself; nay often
the chief Motive of their pretended Passion; 
that a young Lady cou'd never be too frugal
of her Favours towards 'em, forasmuch
as that they interpret every Look and
Word in Favour of themselves, and the
smallest Complacency as a Mark of the
greatest Kindness; that even the most virtuous
of them think it no Crime to falsify
their Vows to us, but rather deem it a
commendable Piece of Gallantry; with
many other Instructions of this Kind, which
I took as Testimonies of her Friendship
and Discretion, but thought not in the
least that it belong'd to me and Marcellus,
'till I found him begin to grow remiss, and
several Days pass'd that I neither met him
in these Walks, nor in Aurora's Chapel,
nor receiv'd any manner of Address or
Message from him; then, Indeed, I began
to fear I was like to be a President in these
Lectures. I must confess, (said Scipiana,
interrupting her) I have much Difficulty
to believe Marcellus false, it being incompatible 
 with his noble Nature, and the
Rules of human Society, after having so
openly avow'd his Passion to you, in Prejudice
of the noble Lucullus and his fair
Daughter Jemella, for him to act an Infidelity,
or even an Indifferency, would render
him not only unworthy of his Name
and Family, but the worst of Miscreants,
not deserving human Society; wherefore I
beg you to suspend your Anger, and be
pleas'd to finish your Story. 
Libidinia, said Clelia, perceiving me uneasy
under this negligent Treatment, went
secretly to visit him at his House, thereby
to inform herself, if possible, of the Cause
of this sudden Change. At her Return she
told me he was sick, which Information
afflicted me extremely, as was manifest by
my Tears; for Sickness is always a State
to be pity'd, but was now deplorable, in
Consideration of what he might suffer for
want of Assistance and Attendance, which
was difficult to be had in that unhappy
Solitude, into which, for my Sake he had
cast himself. This made me redouble my
Sighs and Tears with many sorrowful Complaints,
in all which, Libidinia, as a compassionate
Friend, bore a Part; and taking
out her Handkerchief to dry her Eyes,
there fell out of her Pocket a little Picture,
which I knew to be my Portraiture, that 
I had given him in Testimony of my Affection,
and Belief of his Fidelity. The
Sight of this did very much surprize me,
not knowing how to iaterpret the Meaning. 
Libidinia, after a considerable Pause, said,
my dear Clelia, I can no longer disguise the
Truth, Marcellus is more distemper'd in
Mind than Person, for he has made me a
thousand Protestations of the most tender
Passion in the World; which indeed did
not very much surprize me, by Reason of
the many little Hints and Advances he
had divers Times directed to me, which occasion'd
me so frequently to advise you by
Way of Precaution; but now, having an
Opportunity, he discharg'd his false Heart
to me in as false Words, leaving nothing
unsaid that might assert a real Passion; 
and when I endeavour'd to make him sensible
of his Crime, by shewing him your
Picture, which was pinn'd up just by him,
and withal repeated to him your innumerable
Virtues, and particular Goodness towards
him, in having, for his Sake, risk'd
the Love of your Parents, the Esteem of
all serious and judicious People, and dedicated
to his Love only, that Youth and
Beauty, which ought to be the Object of
many Adorers. The ungrateful Wretch,
(continu'd she) with many opposite Replies,
gave me the Picture, telling me, he found
nothing charming in it, nor in its Original, 
since his Eyes were bless'd with the
Beauties of Libidinia. This Infidelity, said
Libidinia, whether real or feigned, is alike
unpardonable; for, whether he abus'd my
Friend in an absolute Act of Perfidy, or
me in a feign'd Gallantry, I count our
selves both equally and doubly affronted; 
for I deem whatsoever is done to my Friend
as done to myself, and I doubt not but my
Clelia has the same Sentiment on my Behalf; 
and it was the Consideration of this
unworthy Behaviour to us both that caus d
my Sighs and Tears, more than his Indisposition,
tho' I endeavour'd for your Sake
to disguise the Truth for the Present, 'till
my Industry cou'd Work your Heart into
some Kind of Indifferency towards him. 
But Fortune has extorted the Secret from
me sooner than I intended; wherefore, Madam,
I can only recommend to you to join
with me in a just Resentment of his Unworthiness; 
banish, detest, and abhor him,
as the worst of Criminals. 
The Knowledge of this his Falshood,
continu'd Clelia, enrag'd me to the last Degree; 
and now, too late, I was sensible of
my Folly, in contracting an Amour, and
carrying on a Correspondence of that Consequence,
against the Consent of my wise
and honourable Parents. Now I perceiv'd
to my Sorrow, how Passion had clos'd the
Eyes of my Understanding, and rock'd my 
Reason into a Lethargy, otherwise I shou'd
have foreseen his Falshood in the Person
of the abandon'd Jemella. But the just
Gods were pleas'd that I shou'd thus find
my Crime in my Punishment, and so far
aveng'd the Cause of that wrong'd Lady,
as to make her Disgrace light on my Head; 
and that Willow Wreath I vainly thought
her Due, was now become a Crown for my
forsaken Temples. My Heart, which had
often treated its amorous Thoughts at her
Cost, now languish'd in Despair, and became
a Prey to all the gnawing Regrets
that attend a slighted Maid. I who had
neglected the Documents of my Parents,
now became neglected by him, for whose
Sake I had thus overlook'd my Duty. I
who had, by my disobedient and unwary
Conduct, in some Degree tarnish'd the Glory
of my illustrious Family, was now liable
to have my Virtue, Youth, and Innocence,
obscured and sully'd with whatsoever false
Shadows the malicious World shou'd think
fit to draw on this Occasion. In fine, every
Thing appear'd to me with an hideous
Face, and was the more terrible, by Reason
that my self was the only Cause of
this Deformity of Affairs; for 'tis certain,
no Reproach is like Self-Reproach, nor any
Misfortune so hard to undergo, as what we
draw upon our selves Then judge, Madam,
in what Anxiety of Thoughts my poor 
Heart labour'd. But after the first Efforts
of my Anger were past, I begg'd Libidinia
to agitate in this Matter as she thought fit,
only in Gross I desir'd her to restore him a
certain Nosegay of Jewels, which he had
presented me, and charge him never to see
me more. 
In this State, dear Cousin, are my Affairs
at present, being under great Difficulties
what to do; for I am asham'd to discover
to my Uncle his being here in Disguise,
and unwilling to let him remain so any
longer, after such Treatment. I shall trust
to your Wisdom and Goodness, to deliver
me out of this Dilemma; but at present, if
please, we will go in, for, no Doubt, by
this Time my Uncle is stirring, whose
Happiness in the Sight of you, ought not
to be deferr'd.
