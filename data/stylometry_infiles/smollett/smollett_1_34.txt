He attracts the envy and ill offices of the minor
knights of his own order, over whom he obtains
a compleat victory 
Such a preheminence could not be enjoyed
without exciting the malevolence of envy 

and detraction, in the propagation of which,
none were so industrious as the brethren of
his own order, who had, like him, made a
descent upon this island, and could not, without
repining, see the whole harvest in the
hands of one man, who with equal art and
discretion avoided all intercourse with their society. 
In vain they strove to discover his pedigree,
and detect the particular circumstances
of his life and conversation; all their inquiries
were baffled by the obscurity of his origin,
and that solitary scheme which he had adopted
in the beginning of his career. The
whole fruit of their investigation amounted
to no more than a certainty, that there was no
family of any consideration in Europe, known
by the denomination of Fathom; and this
discovery they did not fail to divulge for the
benefit of our adventurer, who had by this
time taken such firm root in the favour of the
great, as to set all those little arts at defiance; 
and when the report reached his ear, actually
made his friends merry with the conjectures
which had been circulated at his expence. 
His adversaries, finding themselves disappointed
in this effort, held a consultation to
devise other measures against him, and came
to a resolution of ending him by the sword, or
rather of expelling him from the kingdom, by
the fear of death, which he hoped he had not
courage enough to resist, because his deportment
had been always remarkably mild and
pacific. It was upon this supposition, that
they left to the determination of the dice, the
choice of the person who should execute
their plan; and the lot falling upon a Swiss, 

who, from the station of a foot soldier in the
Dutch service, out of which he had been
drummed for theft, had erected himself into
the rank of a self created chevalier; this hero
fortified himself with a double dose of brandy,
and betook himself to a certain noted coffee-house,
with an intent to affront Count Fathom
in publick. 
He was lucky enough to find our adventurer
sitting at a table in conversation with some
persons of the first rank; upon which he seated
himself in the next box, and after having
intruded himself into their discourse, which
happened to turn upon the politicks of some
German courts; “Count,” said he to Ferdinand,
in a very abrupt and disagreeable
manner of adress, “I was last night in company
with some gentlemen, among whom a
dispute happened about the place of your nativity; 
pray, what country are you of?” “Sir,” 
answered the other, with great politeness, “I
at present have the honour to be of England.” 
“Oho!” replied the chevalier, “I ask your
pardon, that is to say, you are incog. —Some
people may find it convenient to keep themselves
in that situation.” “True,” said the
count, “but some people are too well known
to enjoy that privilege.” The Swiss being a
little disconcerted at this repartee, which extracted
a smile from the audience; after some
pause, observed, that persons of a certain class
had good reason to drop the remembrance of
what they have been; but a good citizen will
not forget his country or former condition. 
“And a bad citizen,” saith Fathom, “cannot
if he would, provided he has met with 

his deserts; a sharper may as well forget the
shape of a dye, or a discarded soldier the sound
of a drum.” 
As the chevalier's character and story were
not unknown, this application raised an universal
laugh at his expence, which provoked
him to such a degree, that starting up, he
swore Fathom could not have mentioned any
object in nature that he himself resembled so
much as a drum, which was exactly typified by
his emptiness and sound, with this difference
however, that a drum was never noisy till
beaten, whereas the count would never be
quiet until he should have undergone the same
discipline. So saying, he laid his hand upon
his sword with a menacing look, and walked
out as if in expectation of being followed by
our adventurer, who suffered himself to be
detained by the company, and very calmly
took notice, that his antagonist would not be
ill pleased at their interposition. Perhaps he
would not have comported himself with such
ease and deliberation, had not he made such
remarks upon the disposition of the chevalier,
as convinced him of his own safety. He had
perceived a perplexity and perturbation in the
countenance of the Swiss, when he first entered
the coffee-room; his blunt and precipitate
way of accosting him, seemed to denote
confusion and compulsion, and in the midst of
his ferocity, this accurate observer discerned
the trepidation of fear. By the help of these
signs, his sagacity soon comprehended the nature
of his schemes, and prepared accordingly
for a formal defiance. 
His conjecture was verified next morning 

by a visit from the chevalier, who taking it for
granted that Fathom would not face an adversary
in the field, because he had not followed
him from the coffee-house, went to his lodgings
with great confidence, and demanded to see the
count upon an affair that would admit of no
delay. Maurice, according to his instructions,
told him that his master was gone out, but desired
he would have the goodness to repose
himself in a parlour, till the count's return,
which he expected every moment. Ferdinand,
who had taken post in a proper place for observation,
seeing his antagonist fairly admitted,
took the same road, and appearing before him,
wrapped up in a long Spanish cloak, desired to
know what had procured him the honour of
such an early visit. The Swiss, raising his voice
to conceal his agitation, explained his errand,
in demanding reparation, for the injury his honour
had sustained the preceeding day, in that
odious allusion to a scandalous report which
had been raised by the malice of his enemies; 
and insisted in a very imperious stile, upon his
attending him forthwith to the nursery in
Hyde-park. “Have a little patience, said our
adventurer with great composure, and I will
do myself the pleasure to wait upon you in a
few moments.” 
With these words, he rung the bell, and calling
for a bason of water, laid aside his cloak,
and displayed himself in his shirt, with a sword
in his right hand, which was all over besmeared
with recent blood, as if he had just come
from the slaughter of a foe. This phænomenon
made such an impression upon the astonished
chevalier, already discomposed by the 

resolute behaviour of the count, that he became
jaundiced with terror and dismay, and
while his teeth chattered in his head, told our
hero, he had hoped from his known politeness,
to have found him ready to acknowledge
an injury which might have been the
effect of anger or misapprehension, in which
case the affair might have been compromised
to their mutual satisfaction, without proceeding
to those extremities, which, among
men of honour, are always accounted the last
resource. To this representation, Ferdinand
answered, that the affair had been of the chevalier's
own seeking, inasmuch as he had intruded
himself into his company, and treated him
with the most insolent and unprovoked abuse,
which plainly flowed from a premeditated design
against his honour and reputation; he therefore,
far from being disposed to own himself
in the wrong, would not even accept of a public
acknowledgment from him the aggressor,
whom he looked upon as an infamous sharper,
and was resolved to chastise accordingly. 
Here the conversation was interrupted by
the arrival of a person who was brought to the
door in a chair, and conducted into another
apartment, from which a message was brought
to the count, importing, that the stranger desired
to speak with him, upon business of the
last importance. Fathom having chid the servant
for admitting people without his order,
desired the Swiss to excuse him for a minute
longer, and went into the next room; from
whence the following dialogue was overheard
by this challenger. “Count,” said the stranger,
“you are not ignorant of my pretensions 

to the heart of that young lady, at whose house
I met you yesterday; therefore you cannot
be surprized when I declare myself displeased
with your visits and behaviour to my mistress,
and demand that you will instantly promise to
drop the correspondence.” “Else what follows?” 
answered Ferdinand, with a cool and
temperate voice. “My resentment and immediate
defiance; replied the other, for the
only alternative I propose, is to forego your
design upon that lady, or to decide our pretensions
by the sword.” 
Our hero having expressed a regard for this
visitant, as the son of a gentleman whom he
honoured, was at the pains to represent the unreasonableness
of his demand, and the folly of
his presumption; and earnestly exhorted him
to put the issue of his cause upon a more safe
and equitable footing. But this admonition,
instead of appeasing the wrath, seemed to inflame
the resentment of the opponent, who
swore he would not leave him until he should
have accomplished the purport of his errand. In
vain our adventurer requested half an hour for
the dispatch of some urgent business, in which
he was engaged with a gentleman in the other
parlour: this impetuous rival rejected all the
terms he could propose, and even challenged
him to decide the controversy upon the spot; 
an expedient to which the other having assented
with reluctance, the door was secured, the
swords unsheathed, and an hot engagement ensued,
to the inexpressible pleasure of the Swiss,
who did not doubt that he himself would be
screened from all danger by the event of this
rencontre; nevertheless, his hope was disappointed 

in the defeat of the stranger, who was
quickly disarmed, in consequence of a wound
through the sword arm; upon which occasion
Fathom was heard to say, that, in consideration
of his youth and family, he had spared his life; 
but he would not act with the same tenderness
towards any other antagonist. He then bound
up the limb he had disabled, conducted the
vanquished party to his chair, rejoined the
chevalier with a serene countenance, and asking
pardon for having detained him so long,
proposed they should instantly set out in an
hackney coach, for the place of appointment. 
The stratagem thus conducted, had all the
success the inventor could desire. The fear of
the Swiss had risen almost to an extasy, before
the count quitted the room; but after this
sham battle, which had been preconcerted betwixt
our adventurer and his friend Ratchkali,
the chevalier's terrors were unspeakable. He
considered Fathom as a devil incarnate, and
went into the coach as a melafactor bound for
Tyburn. He would have gladly compounded
for the loss of a leg or arm, and entertained
some transient gleams of hope, that he should
escape for half a dozen flesh wounds, which
he would have willingly received, as the price
of his presumption; but, these hopes were
banished by the remembrance of that dreadful
declaration which he had heard the count
make, after having overcome his last adversary; 
and he continued under the power of
the most insupportable pannic, until the carriage
halted at Hyde-park-corner, where he
crawled forth in a most piteous and lamentable 

condition; so that when they reached the
spot, he was scarce able to stand. 
Here he made an effort to speak, and proposed
an accommodation upon a new plan, by
which he promised to leave his cause to the arbitrement
of those gentlemen who were present
at the rupture, and to ask pardon of the
count, provided he should be found guilty of
a trespass upon good manners: but this proposal
would not satisfy the implacable Ferdinand,
who perceiving the agony of the Swiss, resolved
to make the most of the adventure, and
giving him to understand he was not a man
to be trifled with, desired him to draw without
further preamble. Thus compelled, the unfortunate
gamester pulled off his coat, and putting
himself in a posture, to use the words of
Nym, “winked and held out his cold iron.” 
Our adventurer, far from making a gentle
use of the advantages he possessed, fiercely attacked
him, while he was incapable of making
resistance, and aiming at a fleshy part, ran him
through the arm and outside of the shoulder at
the very first pass: the chevalier, already stupified
with the horror of expectation, no sooner
felt his adversary's point in his body, than he
fell to the ground, and concluding he was no
longer a man for this world, began to cross
himself with great devotion, while Fathom
walked home deliberately, and in his way sent
a couple of chairmen to the assistance of the
wounded knight. 
This atchievement, which could not be concealed
from the knowledge of the publick, not
only furnished the character of Fathom with
fresh wreaths of admiration and applause, but 

likewise effectually secured him from any future
attempts of his enemies, to whom the
Swiss, for his own sake, had communicated
such terrible ideas of his valour, as over-awed
the whole community.
