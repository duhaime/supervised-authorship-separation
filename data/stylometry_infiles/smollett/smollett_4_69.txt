I set out for Sussex—consult Mrs. Sagely— 
atchieve an interview with Narcissa— 
return to the ship—we get clear of the
Channel—I learn our destination—we are
chaced by a large ship—the company are dismayed,
and encouraged by the captain's
speech—our pursuer happens to be an
English man of war—we arrive on the coast
of Guinea, purchase 400 negroes, sail for
Paraguay, get safe into the river of Plate,
and sell our cargo to great advantage. 
It was now I put in execution the scheme I had
projected at London and asking leave of the
captain, for Strap and me to stay on shore till the
wind should become favourable, my request was
granted, because he had orders to remain in the
Downs until he should receive some dispatches
from London, which he did not expect in less
than a week. —Having imparted my resolution
to my trusty valet, who (tho' he endeavour'd to
dissuade me from such a rash undertaking) would
not quit me in the enterprize, I hired horses, and
set out immediately for that part of Sussex where
my charmer was confined, which was not above
thirty miles distant from Deal where we mounted. 
—As I was perfectly well acquainted with the
extent of the Squire's estate and influence, I halted
within five miles of his house, where we remained 

'till the twilight, at which time we set forward,
and, by the favour of a dark night, gained a
copse about half a mile from the village where Mrs.
Sagely lived. —Here we left our horses tied to a
tree, and went directly to the house of my old
benefactress, Strap trembling all the way, and
venting ejaculatory petitions to heaven for our
safety. Her habitation being quite solitary, we
arrived at the door without being observed, when
I ordered my companion to enter by himself, and
in case there should be company with her, deliver
a letter which I had wrote for the purpose, and
say that a friend of hers in London, understanding
that he intended to travel this road, had committed
it to his care. —He rapped at the door, to
which the good old matron coming, told him,
that being a lone woman, he must excuse her, if
she did not open it, until he had declared his
name and business. —He answered, that his name
was unknown to her, and that his business was
to deliver a letter, which (to free her from all
manner of apprehension) he would convey to
her through the space between the door and
threshold. —This he instantly performed; and she
no sooner read the contents, which specified my
being present, than she cried, “If the person
who wrote this letter be at hand, let him
speak, that I may be assured by his voice whether
or not I may safely admit him.” —I forthwith
applied my mouth to the key-hole, and pronounced,
“Dear mother, you need not be afraid,
it is I, so much indebted to your goodness,
who now crave admittance.” —She knew my
voice, and opening the door immediately, received
me with a truly maternal affection, manifesting
by the tears she let fall, her concern lest I 

should be discovered, for she had been informed
of every thing that had happened between Narcissa
and me, from the dear captive's own mouth. 
—When I explained the motive of my journey,
which was no other than a desire of seeing the
object of my love before I should quit the kingdom,
that I might in person convince her of the
necessity I was under to leave her, reconcile her
to that event, by describing the advantages that
in all probability would attend it, repeat my vows
of eternal constancy, and enjoy the melancholy
pleasure of a tender embrace at parting—I
say, when I had thus signified my intention, Mrs.
Sagely told me, that Narcissa, upon her return
from the Bath, had been so strictly watched,
that no body, but one or two of the servants devoted
to her brother, was admitted to her presence; 
that afterwards she had been a little enlarged, and
was permitted to see company; during which indulgence,
she had been several times at her cottage:
but of late she had been betrayed by one
of the servants, who discovered to the squire,
that he had once carried a letter from her to the
post-house directed to me; upon which information,
she was now more confined than ever, and
that I could have no chance of seeing her, unless
I would run the risque of getting into the garden,
where she and her maid were every day allowed
to take the air, and lie hid until I should have an
opportunity of speaking to them—an adventure
which would be attended with such danger, that
no man in his right wits would attempt it. — 
This enterprize, hazardous as it was, I resolved
to perform, in spite of all the arguments of Mrs.
Sagely, who reasoned, chid, and intreated by
turns; and the tears and prayers of Strap, who 

conjured me on his knees, to have more regard
to myself as well as to him, than to tempt my
own destruction in such a precipitate manner. 
But I was deal to every thing, but the suggestions of
my love; and ordering him to return immediately
with the horses to the inn from whence we set out,
and wait for my coming in that place, he at first
peremptorily refused to leave me, until I perswaded
him, that if our horses should remain where
they were 'till day-light, they would certainly be
discovered, and the whole county alarmed. On
this consideration, he took his leave in a sorrowful
plight, kissed my hand, and weeping, cried,
“God knows if ever I shall see you again.” — 
My kind landlady finding me obstinate, gave me
her best advice how to behave in the execution
of my project; and after having perswaded me to
take a little refreshment, accommodated me with
a bed, and left me to my repose. —Early in the
morning, I got up, and armed with a couple of
loaded pistols and a hanger, went to the back of
the Squire's garden, climbed over the wall, and,
according to Mrs. Sagely's direction, concealed
myself in a thicket, hard by an alcove which terminated
a walk at a good distance from the house,
which (I was told) my mistress chiefly frequented. 
—Here I absconded from five a-clock in the
morning to six in the evening, without seeing a
human creature; at last I perceived two women
approaching, whom by my throbbing heart I soon
recogniz'd to be the adorable Narcissa and Miss
Williams. I felt the strongest agitation of soul
at the sight; and guessing that they would repose
themselves in the alcove, I stept into it unperceiv'd,
and laid upon the stone-table a picture of myself
in miniature, for which I had sat in London, purposing 

to leave it with Narcissa before I should go
abroad. I exposed it in this manner, as an introduction
to my own appearance, which, without
some previous intimation, I was afraid might
have an unlucky effect upon the delicate nerves
of my fair enslaver; and then withdrew into the
thicket, where I could hear their discourse, and
suit myself to the circumstances of the occasion. 
—As they advanced, I observed an air of melancholy
in the countenance of Narcissa, blended
with such unspeakable sweetness, that I could
scarce refrain from flying into her arms, and
kissing away the pearly drop that stood collected
in each bewitching eye. According to my expectation,
she entered the alcove, and perceiving
something on the table, took it up. No sooner
did she cast her eye upon the features, than she
startled, crying, “Gracious God!” and the
roses instantly vanished from her cheeks. —Her
confidante, alarm'd at this exclamation, looked at
the picture, and, struck with the resemblance,
cried, “O Jesus! the very features of Mr.Random!” 
Narcissa having recollected herself a
little, said, “Whatever angel brought it hither
as a comfort to me in my affliction, I am
thankful for the benefit, and will preserve it as
the dearest object of my care.” So saying,
she kissed it with surprising ardour, shed a flood
of tears, and then deposited the lifeless image in
her lovely bosom. Transported at these symptoms
of her unaltered affection, I was about to throw
myself at her feet, when Miss Williams, whose
reflection was less engaged than that of her
mistress, observed, that the picture could not
transport itself hither, and that she could not help
thinking I was not far off. —The gentle Narcissa 

starting at this conjecture, answered, “Heaven
forbid! for although nothing in the universe
could yield me satisfaction equal to that of his
presence for one poor moment, in a proper
place, I would rather forfeit his company— 
almost for ever, than see him here, where
his life would be exposed to so much danger.” 
—I could no longer restrain the impulse of my
passion, but breaking from my concealment, stood
before her, when she uttered a fearful shriek, and
fainted in the arms of her companion. I flew
towards the treasure of my soul, clasped her in
my embrace, and with the warmth of my kisses,
brought her again to life. O! that I were endowed
with the expression of a Raphael, the
graces of a Guido, the magick touches of a Titian,
that I might represent the fond concern,
the chastened rapture, and ingenuous blush that
mingled on her beauteous face, when she opened
her eyes upon me, and pronounced, “O heavens!
is it you!” 
I am afraid I have already encroached upon
the reader's patience, with the particulars of this
amour, on which (I own) I cannot help being
impertinently circumstantial. I shall therefore
omit the less material passages of this interview,
during which I convinced her reason, tho'
I could not appease the sad presages of her love,
with regard to the long voyage, and dangers I
must undergo. —When we had spent an hour
(which was all she could spare from the barbarity
of her brother's vigilance) in lamenting over our
hard fate, and in repeating our reciprocal vows,
Miss Williams reminded us of the necessity there
was for our immediate parting; and sure, lovers
never parted with such sorrow and reluctance as we. 

But because my words are incapable of doing justice
to this affecting circumstance, I am obliged to
draw a veil over it, and observe, that I returned
in the dark to the house of Mrs. Sagely, who
was overjoy'd to hear of my success, and opposed
the tumults of my grief with such strength of
reason, that my mind regained in some measure
its tranquility; and that very night, after having
forced upon this good gentlewoman a purse of
twenty guineas, as a token of my gratitude and
esteem, I tock my leave of her, set out on foot
for the inn, where my arrival freed honest Strap from
the horrors of unutterable dread. 
We took horse immediately, and alighted early
next morning at Deal, where I found my uncle
in great concern on account of my absence, because
he had received his dispatches, and must have
weighed with the first fair wind, whether I had
been on board or not. —Next day, a brisk easterly
gale springing up, we set sail, and in eight and
forty hours got clear of the Channel. 
When we were about 200 leagues from
the Land's end, the captain taking me apart
into the cabbin, told me, that, now he was permitted
by his instructions, he would disclose the
intent and destination of our voyage: “The
ship, said he, which has been fitted out at a
great expence, is bound for the coast of Guinea,
where we shall exchange part of our cargo
for slaves and gold dust; from thence we will
transport our negroes to Buenos-Ayres in New-Spain,
where (by virtue of passports obtained
from our own court, and that of Madrid) we
will dispose of them and the goods that remain
on board for silver, by means of our
supercargo, who is perfectly well acquainted 

with the coast, the lingo and inhabitants.” 
—Being thus let into the secret of our expedition,
I borrowed of the supercargo a Spanish grammar,
dictionary, and some other books of the same
language, which I studied with such application,
that before we arrived in New-Spain, I could
maintain a conversation with him in that tongue. — 
Being arrived in the warm latitudes, I ordered
(with the captain's consent) the whole ship's company
to be blooded and purged, myself undergoing
the same evacuation, in order to prevent
those dangerous fevers to which northern constitutions
are subject in hot climates; and I have
reason to believe that this precaution was not unserviceable,
for we lost but one sailor during our
whole passage to the coast. 
One day, when we had been about five weeks
at sea, we descried to windward a large ship bearing
down upon us with all the fail she could carry. 
Upon which, my uncle ordered the studding-sails
to be hoisted, and the ship to be cleared for engaging; 
but finding, that (to use the seamen's
phrase) we were very much wronged by the ship
which had us in chace, and which by this time
had hoisted French colours, he commanded the
studding-sails to be taken in, the courses to be
clewed up, the main-top-sail to be backed, the
tompions to be taken out of the guns, and every
man to repair to his quarters. While every body
was busied in the performance of these orders,
Strap came upon the quarter-deck, trembling, and
and looking aghast, and, with a voice half suppressed
by fear, asked if I thought we were a
match for the vessel in pursuit of us. Observing
his consternation, I said, “What! are you
afraid, Strap?” “Afraid! (he replied) n–n–no, 

what should I be afraid of? I thank God I have
a clear conscience;—but I believe it will be a
bloody battle, and I wish you may not have occasion
for another hand to assist you in the cockpit.” 
—I immediately perceived his drift, and making
the captain acquainted with his situation, desired
he might be stationed below with me and my
mates. My uncle, incensed at his pusilanimity,
bid me send him down instantly, that his fear
might not infect the ship's company; whereupon
I told the poor steward, that I had begg'd him for
an assistant, and desired him to go down and help
my mates to get ready the instruments and
dressings. —Notwithstanding the satisfaction
he must have felt at these tidings, he affected
a shyness of quitting the upper deck; and said,
he hoped I did not imagine he was afraid to do
his duty above board, for he believed himself as
well prepared for death as any man in the ship,
no disparagement to me or the captain. —I was
disgusted at this affectation, and in order to punish
his hypocrisy, assured him, he might either go
down to the cockpit, or stay upon deck during
the engagement. Alarmed at this indifference,
he replied, “Well, to oblige you, I'll go down,
but remember it is more for your sake than my
own.” So saying, he disappeared in a twinkling,
without waiting for an answer. —By this
time we could observe two tire of guns in the
ship which pursued us, and which was now but
two short miles astern. This discovery had an
evident effect upon the sailors, who did not scruple
to say, that we should be tore to pieces, and blown
out of the water, and that if in case any of them
should lose their precious limbs, they must go a-begging
for life, for there was no provision made 

by the merchants for those poor souls who are
maimed in their service. The captain understanding
this backwardness, ordered the crew
abaft, and spoke to them thus; “My lads, I am
told you hang an a&wblank;se. —I have gone to sea
thirty years, man and boy, and never saw
English sailors afraid before. —Mayhap you
think I want to expose you for the lucre of
gain. —Whosoever thinks so, thinks a damned
lie, for my whole cargo is insured; so that in
case I should be taken, my loss will not be
great. —The enemy is stronger than we to be
sure. —What then? have we not a chance for
carrying away one of her masts, and so get
clear of her? —If we find her too hard
for us, 'tis but striking at last. —If any man
is hurt in the engagement, I promise on the
word of an honest seaman, to make them a
recompence according to his loss. —So now,
you that are lazy, lubberly, cowardly dogs, get
away, and sculk in the hold, and bread-room; 
and you that are jolly boys, stand by me, and
let us give one broad-side for the honour of
old England.” This eloquent harangue was
so well adapted to the disposition of his hearers,
that one and all of them, pulling off their hats,
waved them over their heads, and saluted him
with three chears; upon which he sent his boy
for two large case-bottles of brandy, and having
treated every man with a dram, they repaired
to their quarters, and waited impatiently for the
word of command. —I must do my uncle the
justice to say, that in the whole of his disposition,
he behaved with the utmost intrepidity, conduct
and deliberation. —The enemy being very near, he
ordered me to my station, and was just going to 

give the word for hoisting the colours, and firing,
when the supposed Frenchman, hauled down his
white pennant jack and ensign, hoisted English
ones, and fired a gun a-head of us: This was a
joyful event to captain Bowling, who immediately
shewed his colours, and fired a gun to
leeward: Upon which the other ship run along-side
of him, hailed him, and giving him to know
that she was an English man of war of forty
guns, ordered him to hoist out his boat and
come on board. —This he performed with the
more alacrity, because upon enquiry, he found
that she was commanded by an old mess-mate of
his, who was overjoyed to see him, detained him
to dinner, and sent his barge for the supercargo
and me, who were very much caressed on his
account. —As this commander was destined
to cruise upon the French, in the latitude of
Martinico, his stem and quarters were adorned
with white flowers de lis, and the whole shell
of the ship so much disguised, for a decoy to
the enemy, that it was no wonder my uncle did
not know her, although he had sailed on board
of her many years. —We kept company with her
four days, during which time the captains were
never asunder, and then parted, our course lying
different from hers. 
In less than a fortnight after, we made
the land of Guinea, near the mouth of the river
Gambia, and trading along the coast as far to
the southward of the Line as Angola and Bengula,
in less than six months disposed of the greatest
part of our cargo, and purchased four hundred
negroes, my adventure having been laid out
chiefly in gold dust. 

Our compliment being made up, we took our
departure from Cape Negro, and arrived in the
Rio de la Plata in six weeks, having met with
nothing remarkable in our voyage, except an
epidemic fever, not unlike the jail distemper,
which broke out among our slaves, and carried
off a good many of the ship's company; among
whom I lost one of my mates, and poor Strap
had well nigh given up the ghost. —Having produced
our passport to the Spanish governor, we
were received with great courtesy, sold our slaves
in a very few days, and could have put off five
times the number at our own price; being obliged
to smuggle the rest of our merchandize,
consisting of European bale goods, which however
we made shift to dispose of at a great advantage.
