We lament over the fate of our companion
—the captain offers Morgan his liberty,
which he refuses to accept—we are
brought before him and examined— 
Morgan is sent back to custody, whither also
I am remanded after a curious trial. 
The news of this event affected my fellow-prisoner
and me extremely, as our unfortunate
companion had justly acquired by his amiable
disposition, the love and esteem of us both; 
and the more we regretted his untimely fate, the
greater horror we conceived for the villain who
was undoubtedly the occasion of it. —This abandoned
miscreant did not discover the least symptom
of concern for Thomson's death, although
he must be conscious to himself, of having driven
him by ill usage to that fatal resolution; but desired
the captain to set Morgan at liberty again
to look after the patients. Accordingly, one of
the corporals was sent up to unfetter him; when
he protested he would not be released until he
should know for what he was confined; nor 

would he be a tennis-ball, nor a shittle-cock, nor
a trudge, nor a scullion to any captain under the
sun. —Oakhum finding him obstinate, and fearing
it would not be in his power to exercise his
tyranny much longer with impunity, was willing
to shew some appearance of justice, and therefore
ordered us both to be brought before him, on the
quarter-deck, where he sat in state, with his
clerk on one side, and his counsellor Mackshane
on the other. —When we approached, he honoured
us with this salutation: “So, gentlemen,
d&wblank;n my blood! many a captain in the navy
would have ordered you both to be tucked up
to the yard's arm, without either judge or
jury, for the crimes you have been guilty of; 
but d&wblank;n my blood, I have too much good
nature, in allowing such dogs as you to make
your defence.” —“Captain Oaghum, (said
my fellow-sufferer) certainly it is in your
power (Got help the while) to tuck us all up
at your will, and desire, and pleasures. —And
perhaps it would be petter for some of us to
be tucked up, than undergo the miseries to
which we have been exposed. —So may the
farmer hang his kids for his diversion, and amusement,
and mirth; but there is such a
thing as justice, if not upon earth, surely in
heaven, that will punish with fire and primstone
all those who take away the lives of innocent
people out of wantonness and parparity (look
you.) —In the mean time, I shall be glad to
know the crimes laid to my charge, and see
the person who accuses me.” —“That you
shall (said the captain) here doctor, what have
you to say?” Mackshane stepping forward,
hemmed a good while, in order to clear his 

throat, and before he began, Morgan accosted
him thus: “Doctor Mackshane, look in my
face—look in the face of an honest man,
who abhorrs a false-witness as he abhorrs the
tevil, and Got be judge between you and me.” 
—The doctor not minding this conjuration,
made the following speech, as near as I can remember: 
—“I'll tell you what, Mr. Morgan, to be
sure what you say is just, in regard to an honest
man; and if so be it appears as how you are
an honest man, then it is my opinion, that you
deserve to be acquitted, in relation to that
there affair; for I tell you what, captain Oakhum
is resolved for to do every body justice. — 
As for my own part, all that I have to alledge,
is that I have been informed, you have spoken
disrespectful words against your captain, who
to be sure, is the most honourable and generous
commander in the king's service, without
asparagement or acceptation of man, woman
or child.” —Having uttered this elegant harrangue,
on which he seemed to plume himself,
Morgan replied, “I do partly guess, and conceive,
and understand your meaning, which I
wish could be more explicite: But however,
I do suppose, I am not to be condemned upon
bare hear-say; or if I am convicted of speaking
disrespectfully of captain Oakhum, I hope
there is no treason in my words.” —“But
there's mutiny, by G&sblank;d, and that's death by
the articles of war (cried Oakhum.) —In the
mean time, let the witnesses be called.” — 
Hereupon Mackshane's servant appeared, and the
boy of our mess, whom they had seduced and tutored
for the purpose. —The first declared, that
Morgan, as he descended the cockpit ladder, 

one day, cursed the captain and called him a savage
beast, saying, he ought to be hunted down
as an enemy to mankind. —“This (said the
clerk) is a strong presumption of a design
formed against the captain's life. —For why? 
It presupposes malice afore-thought, and a criminal
intention a priori.” —“Right (said the
captain to this miserable grub, who had been
an attorney's boy) you shall have law enough,
here's Cook and Littlejohn for it.” This evidence
was confirmed by the boy, who affirmed,
he heard the first mate say, that the captain had
no more bowels than a bear, and the surgeon had
no more brains than an ass. —Then the centinel
who heard our discourse on the poop was examined,
and informed the court that the Welchman
assured me, that captain Oakhum and doctor
Mackshane would toss upon billows of burning
brimstone in hell for their barbarity. —The clerk
observed, that here was an evident prejudication,
which confirmed the former suspicion of a conspiracy
against the life of captain Oakhum; for,
because, how could Morgan so positively pronounce
that the captain and surgeon would be
damned, unless he had intention to make away
with them before they could have time to repent? 
—This sage explanation had great weight with
our noble commander, who exclaimed, “What
have you to say to this, Taffy? you seem to
be taken all a-back, brother, hah!” —Morgan
was too much of a gentleman to disown the
text, although he absolutely denied the truth of
the comment: Upon which the captain, strutting
up to him, with a ferocious countenance,
said, “So, Mr. Son-of-a-b&wblank;ch, you confess
you honoured me with the names of bear and 

beast, and pronounced my damnation! D&wblank;n
my heart! I have a good mind to have you
brought to a court-martial and hanged, you
dog.” —Here Mackshane having occasion for
an assistant, interposed, and begged the captain
to pardon Mr. Morgan, with his wonted goodness,
upon condition that he the delinquent should make
such submission as the nature of his misdemeanour
demanded. —Upon which the Cambro-Briton, who
on this occasion, would have made no submission
to the Great Mogul, surrounded with his guards,
thanked the doctor for his mediation, and acknowledged
himself in the wrong for having called
the image of Got, a beast, “but (said he) I spoke
by metaphor, and parable, and comparison,
and types; as we signify meekness by a lamb,
letchery by a goat, and craftiness by a fox; so
we liken ignorance to an ass, and brutality to a
bear, and fury to a tyger;—therefore I made
these similies to express my sentiments (look
you) and what I said, before Got, I will not
unsay before man nor peast neither.” —Oakhum
was so provoked at this insolence (as he termed it)
that he ordered him forthwith to be carried to the
place of his confinement, and his clerk to proceed
in the examination of me. —The first question
put to me, was touching the place of my nativity,
which I declared to be the north of Scotland. 
“The north of Ireland more liker (cried the captain)
but we shall bring you up presently.” — 
He then asked what religion I professed; and
when I answered, “The protestant,” swore I
was as arrant a Roman as ever went to mass. — 
“Come, come, clerk (continued he) catechise
him a little on this subject.” —But before I relate
the particulars of the clerk's enquiries, it will 

not be amiss to inform the reader that our commander
himself was an Hibernian, and, if not
shrewdly belied, a Roman Catholick to boot. — 
“You say you are a protestant (said the clerk)
make the sign of the cross with your fingers, so,
and swear upon it, to that affirmation.” — 
When I was about to perform this ceremony,
the captain cried with some emotion, “No, no,
damme! I'll have no profanation neither. — 
But go on with your interrogations.” — 
“Well then (proceeded my examiner) how
many sacraments are there?” —To which I
replied, “Two.” —“What are they? (said he.)” 
I answered, “Baptism and the Lord's Supper.” 
—“And so you would explode confirmation and
marriage altogether? (said Oakhum) I thought
this fellow was a rank Roman.” —The clerk,
though he was bred under an attorney, could
not refrain from blushing at this blunder, which
he endeavoured to conceal, by observing, that
these decoys would not do with me who seemed
to be an old offender. —He went on, with asking
if I believed in transubstantiation; but I treated the
notion of the real presence with such disrespect that
his patron was scandalized at my impiety, and commanded
him to proceed to the plot. —Whereupon
this miserable pettifogger told me, there was great
reason to suspect me of being a spy on board; 
and that I had entered into a conspiracy with
Thomson and others not yet detected, against the
life of captain Oakhum. —To support which accusation; 
they adduced the testimony of our boy,
who declared he had often heard the deceased
Thomson and me whispering together, and could
distinguish the words, “Oakhum, rascal, poison,
pistol,” by which it appeared, we did intend 

to use sinister means to accomplish his destruction. 
That the death of Thomson seemed to confirm
this conjecture, who, either feeling the stings of
remorse, for being engaged in such a horrid confederacy,
or fearing a discovery, by which he must
have infallibly suffered an ignominious death, had
put a fatal period to his own existence. —But what
established the truth of the whole, was a book in
cypher found among my papers, which exactly
tallied with one found in his chest, after his disappearance: 
This, he observed, was a presumption
very near proof positive, and would determine
any jury in christendom to find me guilty. — 
In my own defence, I alledged that I had been
dragged on board at first very much against my
inclination, as I could prove by the evidence of
some people now in the ship; consequently could
have no design of becoming spy at that time; and
ever since had been entirely out of the reach of
any correspondence that could justly intail that
suspicion upon me;—and as for conspiring against
my captain's life, it could not be supposed
that any man in his right wits would harbour the
least thought of such an undertaking, which he
could not possibly perform without certain infamy
and ruin to himself, even if he had all the inclination
in the world. —That allowing the boy's
evidence to be true (which I affirmed was false and
malicious) nothing conclusive could be gathered
from a few incoherent words: Neither was the fate
of Mr. Thomson a circumstance more favourable
for the charge; for I had in my pocket, a letter
which too well explained that mystery, in a
very different manner from that which was supposed: 
With these words I produced the following
letter, which Jack Rattlin brought to me the 

very day after Thomson disappeared; and told
me it was committed to his care by the deceased,
who made him promise not to deliver it sooner. 
The clerk taking it out of my hand, read aloud
the contents, which were these: 

Dear Friend,
“I am so much oppressed with the fatigue I
daily and nightly undergo, and the barbarous
usage of doctor Mackshane, who is
bent on your destruction, as well as mine,
that I am resolved to free myself from this
miserable life, and before you receive this, shall
be no more. I could have wished to die in
your good opinion, which I am afraid I shall
forfeit by the last act of my life; but if you
cannot acquit me, I know you will at least
preserve some regard for the memory of an
unfortunate young man who loved you. —I
recommend it to you, to beware of Mackshane,
whose revenge is implacable. —I wish all prosperity
to you and Mr. Morgan, to whom
pray offer my last respects, and beg to be remembered
as your unhappy friend and countryman. 
“William Thomson,” 
This letter was no sooner read, than Mackshane,
in a transport of rage, snatched it out of
the clerk's hands, and tore it into a thousand
pieces, saying, it was a villainous forgery, contrived
and executed by myself. —The captain and
clerk declared themselves of the same opinion, 

notwithstanding I insisted on having the remains
of it compared to other writings of Thomson,
which they had in possession; and I was ordered
to answer the last article of my accusation, namely,
the book of cyphers found among my papers. 
—“That is easily done (said I.) What you are
pleased to call cyphers, are no other than the
Greek characters, in which, for my amusement,
I kept a diary of every thing remarkable
that has occurred to my observation since
the beginning of the voyage, till the day on
which I was put in irons; and the same method,
was practised by Mr. Thomson who
copied mine.” —“A very likely story! (cried
Mackshane) what occasion was there for using
Greek characters, if you were not afraid of
discovering what you had wrote?—but, what
d'ye talk of Greek characters? —D'ye think I
am so ignorant of the Greek language, as not
to distinguish its letters from these, which are
no more Greek than Chinese? No, no, I
will not give up my knowledge of the Greek
for you, nor none that ever came from your
country.” So saying, with an unparalleled
effronterie, he repeated some gibberish, which
by the sound seemed to be Irish, and made it
pass for Greek with the captain, who looking at
me with a contemptible sneer, exclaimed, “Ah
ha! have you caught a tartar?” I could not help
smiling at the consummate assurance of this Hibernian,
and offered to refer the dispute to any body
on board, who understood the Greek alphabet: 
Upon which Morgan was brought back, and being
made acquainted with the affair, took the
book and read a whole page in English, without
hesitation, deciding the controversy in my 

favour. —The doctor was so far from being out
of countenance at this, that he affirmed Morgan
was in the secret, and repeated from his own invention. 
—Oakhum said, “Ay, ay, I see they
are both in a story,” and dismissed my fellow-mate
to his cock-loft, although I proposed that
he and I should read and translate separately,
any chapter or verse in the Greek-testament in
his possession, by which it would appear whether
we or the surgeon spoke truth. —Not being endued
with eloquence enough to convince the
captain that there could be no juggle nor confederacy
in this expedient, I begged to be examined
by some unconcerned person on board, who understood
Greek: Accordingly the whole ship's
company, officers and all, were called upon deck,
among whom it was proclaimed, that if any of
them could speak Greek, he or they so qualified,
should ascend the quarter-deck immediately. — 
After some pause two fore-mast-men came up
and professed their skill in that language, which
(they said) they acquired during several voyages
to the Levant, among the Greeks of the Morea. 
The captain exulted much in this declaration, and
put my journal-book into the hands of one of
them, who candidly owned he could neither read
nor write; the other acknowledged the same degree
of ignorance, but pretended to speak the Greek
lingo with any man on board; and addressing
himself to me, pronounced some sentences of a
barbarous corrupted language, which I did not
understand. —I asserted that the modern Greek
was as different from that spoke and written by
the ancients, as the English used now from the
old Saxon spoke in the time of Hengist; and as
I had only learned the true original tongue, in 

which Homer, Pindar, the evangelists and other
Great men of antiquity wrote, it could not
be supposed that I should know any thing of an
imperfect Gothic dialect that rose on the ruins of
the former, and scarce retained any traces of the
old expression. —But if doctor Mackshane, who
pretended to be master of the Greek language,
could maintain a conversation with these seamen,
I would retract what I had said, and be content
to suffer any punishment he should think proper
to inflict. —I had no sooner uttered these words,
than the surgeon knowing one of the fellows to
be his countryman, accosted him in Irish, and
was answered in the same brogue; then a dialogue
ensued between them, which they affirmed
to be Greek, after having secured the secrecy
of the other tar, who had his cue in the
language of the Morea from his companion, before
they would venture to assert such an intrepid
falshood. —“I thought (said Oakhum) we should
discover the imposture at last,—Let the rascal
be carried back to his confinement. —I find
he must dangle.” —Having nothing further to
urge in my own behalf, before a court so prejudiced
with spite, and fortified with ignorance
against truth, I suffered myself to be reconducted
peaceably to my fellow-prisoner, who
hearing the particulars of my trial, lifted up his
hands and eyes to heaven, and uttered a dreadful
groan; and not daring to disburthen his thoughts
to me by speech, lest he might be overheard by
the centinel, burst forth into a Welch song,
which he accompanied with a thousand contortions
of face and violent gestures of body.
