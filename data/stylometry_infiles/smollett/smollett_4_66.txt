I read Melopogn's tragedy, and conceive a
vast opinion of his genius—he recounts
his adventures. 
While we eat our breakfast together, I
acquainted him with the character and condition
of the poet, who came in with his play at that
instant, and imagining we were engaged about
business, could not be prevailed upon to sit; 
but leaving his performance, went away. —My
friend's tender heart was melted at the sight of
a gentleman and Christian (for he had a great veneration
for both these epithits) in such misery; 
and assented with great chearfulness to a proposal
I made of cloathing him with our superfluities; 
a task with which he charged himself, and departed
immediately to perform it. 
He was no sooner gone, than I locked my
door and sat down to the tragedy, which I read
to the end with vast pleasure, not a little amazed at
the conduct of the managers who had rejected it. 
—The fable, in my opinion was well chosen,
and naturally conducted, the incidents interesting,
the characters beautifully contrasted, strongly
marked, and well supported; the diction poetical,
spirited and correct; the unities of the drama
maintained with the most scrupulous exactness; 
the opening gradual and engaging; the &grp;&gre;&grr;&gri;&grp;&gre;&grt;&gre;&gri;&gra;&gri;
surprizing, and the catastrophe affecting: In 

short, I judged it by the laws of Aristotle and
Horace, and could find nothing in it exceptionable,
but a little too much embellishment in some few
places, which objection he removed to my satisfaction,
by a quotation from Aristotle's poetics,
importing, that the least interesting parts of a
poem ought to be raised and dignified by the charms
and energy of diction. 
I revered his genius, and was seized with an
eager curiosity to know the particular events of
a fortune so unworthy of his merit. —At that instant
Strap returned with a bundle of cloaths,
which I sent with my compliments to Mr. Melopoyn,
as a small token of my regard, and desired
the favour of his company to dinner. —He
accepted my present and invitation, and in less
than half an hour made his appearance in a decent
dress, which altered his figure very much to his
advantage. —I perceived by his countenance, that
his heart was big with gratitude, and endeavoured
to prevent his acknowledgments, by asking pardon
for the liberty I had taken; he made no
reply, but with an aspect full of admiration and
esteem, bowed to the ground, while the tears
gushed from his eyes. —Affected with these symptoms
of an ingenuous mind, I shifted the conversation
from this subject, and complimented him
on his performance, which I assured him, afforded
me infinite pleasure. —My approbation made him
happy; dinner being served, and Jackson arrived,
I begged their permission for Strap to sit at table
with us, after having informed them, that he was
a person to whom I was extremely obliged; 
they were kind enough to grant that favour, and
we eat together with great harmony and satisfaction. 

Our meal being ended, I expressed my wonder
at the little regard Mr. Melopoyn had met with
from the world; and signified a desire of hearing
how he had been treated by the managers of the
play-houses, to whom, I understood from Jackson,
he had offered his tragedy, without success. 
—“There is so little entertaining in the incidents
of my life (said he) that I am sure the
recital will not recompence your attention; but
since you discover an inclination to know
them, I understand my duty too well to disappoint
your desire.” 
My father, who was a curate in the country,
being by the narrowness of his circumstances,
hindred from maintaining me at the university,
took the charge of my education upon
himself, and laboured with such industry and
concern in the undertaking, that I had little cause
to regret the want of publick masters. —Being
at great pains to consult my natural byass, he
discovered in me betimes, an inclination for
poetry; upon which he recommended to me an
intimate acquaintance with the classicks, in the
cultivation of which, he assisted me with paternal
zeal and uncommon erudition. —When he
thought me sufficiently acquainted with the ancients,
he directed my studies to the best modern
authors, French and Italian as well as English,
and laid a particular injunction upon me, to make
myself master of my mother tongue. 
About the age of eighteen, I grew ambitious
of undertaking a work of some consequence; 
and with my father's approbation, actually planned
the tragedy you have read; but before I
had finished four acts, that indulgent parent died, 

and left my mother and me in very indigent
circumstances. —A near relation compassionating
our distress, took us into his family, where I
brought my fable to a conclusion; and soon after,
my mother quitted this life. —When my sorrow
for this melancholy event had subsided, I told
my kinsman, who was a farmer, that having
paid my last duty to my parent, I had now no
attachment to detain me in the country, and
therefore was resolved to set out for London, and
offer my play to the stage, where I did not doubt
of acquiring a large share of fame as well as
fortune; in which case I should not be unmindful
of my friends and benefactors. —My cousin
was ravished with the prospect of my felicity, and
willingly contributed towards the expence of fitting
me out for my expedition. 
Accordingly, I took a place in the waggon,
and arrived in town, where I hired an apartment
in a garret, willing to live as frugally as
possible, until I should know what I had to expect
from the manager, to whom I intended to
offer my play. —For though I looked upon myself
as perfectly secure of a good reception, imagining
that a patentee would be as eager to receive,
as I to present my production; I did not
know whether or not he might be pre-engaged
in favour of another author, which would certainly
retard my success. —On this consideration
too, I determined to be speedy in my application,
and even to wait upon one of the managers, the
very next day. For this purpose, I enquired of
my landlord, if he knew where either, or both
of them lived; and he being curious to know my
business, and at the same time, appearing to be
a very honest friendly man (a tallow-chandler) 

I made him acquainted with my design; upon which
he told me, that I went the wrong way to work; 
that I would not find such easy access to a manager
as I imagined; and that if I delivered my performance
without proper recommendation, it
would be as one to a thousand if ever it should
be minded. —“Take my advice (said he) and
your business is done. —One of the patentees
is a good catholick, as I am, and uses the same
father who confesses me. —I will make you
acquainted with this good priest, who is an
excellent scholar, and if he shall approve of
your play, his recommendation will go a great
way in determining Mr. Supple to bring it on
the stage.” —I applauded his expedient, and
was introduced to the friar, who having perused
the tragedy, was pleased to signify his approbation,
and commended me in particular, for having
avoided all reflections upon religion. —He
promised to use all his influence with his son
Supple, in my behalf, and to inform himself
that very day, when it would be proper for
me to wait upon him with the piece. —He was
punctual in performing his engagement, and next
morning gave me to understand, that he had
mentioned my affair to the manager, and that I
had no more to do, than to go to his house any
time in the forenoon, and make use of his name,
upon which I would find immediate admittance. 
—I took his advice, put my performance in my
bosom, and having received directions, went immediately
to the house of Mr. Supple, and knocked
at the door, that had a wicket in the middle,
faced with a net-work of iron, through which a
servant having viewed me some time, demanded
to know my business. —I told him, my business 

was with Mr. Supple, and that I came from Mr.
O Varnish. —He examined my appearance once
more, then went away, returned in a few minutes,
and said his master was busy and could
not be seen. —Although I was a little mortified
at my disappointment, I was persuaded that my
reception was owing to Mr. Supple's ignorance
of my errand; and that I might meet with no
more obstructions of the same kind, I desired
Mr. O Varnish to be my introductor the next
time. —He complied with my request,
and obtained immediate admittance to the manager,
who received me with the utmost civility,
and promised to read my play with the first convenience. 
—By his own appointment I called again
in a fortnight, but he was gone out; I returned
in a week after, and the poor gentleman was extremely
ill; I renewed my visit in a fortnight
after that, and he assured me, he had been so
much fatigued with business, that he had not
been able as yet to read it to an end; but he
would take the first opportunity; and in the
mean time, observed, that what he had yet seen
of it was very entertaining. —I comforted myself
with this declaration a few weeks longer, at the
end of which I appeared again before his wicket,
was let in, and found him laid up with the gout. 
I no sooner entered his chamber, than looking
at me with a languishing eye, he pronounced,
“Mr. Melopoyn, I'm heartily sorry for an accident
that has happened during my illness— 
you must know, that my eldest boy, finding
your manuscript upon the table, in the dining-room,
where I used to read it, carried it into
the kitchen, and leaving it there, a negligent
wench of a cook maid, mistaking it for wastepaper, 

has expended it all but a few leaves in
singeing fouls upon the spit—But I hope the
misfortune is not irreparable, since, no doubt,
you have several copies.” 
I protest to you, my good friend Mr. Random,
I was extremely shocked at this information!
but the good-natured gentleman seemed to be so
much affected with my misfortune, that I suppressed
my concern, and told him, that altho' I had
not another copy, I should be able to retrieve the
loss by writing another from my memory, which
was very tenacious. You cannot imagine how well
pleased Mr. Supple was at this assurance; he begged
I would set about it immediately, and carefully revolve
and recollect every circumstance, before I
pretended to commit it to paper, that it might
be the same individual play that he had perused. 
—Encouraged by this injunction, which plainly
demonstrated how much he interested himself in
the affair, I tasked my remembrance and industry,
and in three weeks produced the exact image of
the former, which was conveyed to him by my
good friend, father O Varnish, who let me know
next day, that Mr. Supple would revise it superficially,
in order to judge of its sameness with the
other, and then give his final answer. —For
this examination I allotted a week; and in full
confidence of seeing it acted in a little while, demanded
an audience of the manager, when that
term was expired. —But alas! the season had slipt
away insensibly; he convinced me, that if my
play had been put into rehearsal at that time, it
could not have been ready for performing, until
the end of March, when the benefit nights come
on; consequently it would have interfered with 

the interest of the players, whom it was not my
business to disoblige. 
I was fain to acquiesce in these reasons, which
to be sure were extremely just; and to reserve
my performance to the next season, when he
hoped I would not be so unlucky. —Although it
was a grievous disappointment to me, who by
this time, began to want both money and necessaries; 
having, on the strength of my expectation
from the theatre, launched out into some
extravagancies, by which the sum I brought to
town was already almost consumed. —Indeed, I
ought to be ashamed at this circumstance of my
conduct: For my finances were sufficient, with
good œconomy, to have maintained me comfortably
a whole year. —You will perhaps be amazed
when I tell you, that in six months, I expended
not a farthing less than ten guineas: But when
one considers the temptations to which a
young man is exposed in this great city, especially
if he is addicted to pleasure as I am, the
wonder will vanish, or at least abate. —Nor was
the cause of my concern limited to my own situation
entirely: I had wrote an account of my
good reception to my kinsman the farmer, and desired
him to depend upon me for the money he
had kindly accommodated me with, about the
end of February: which promise I now found
myself unable to perform. —However, there was
no remedy but patience: I applied to my landlord,
who was a very good-natured man, candidly
owned my distress, and begged his advice in
laying down some plan for my subsistence. —He
readily promised to consult his confessor on this
subject, and in the mean time, told me, I was
welcome to lodge and board with him, until fortune 

should put it in my power to make restitution. 
Mr. O Varnish being informed of my necesty,
offered to introduce me to the author of a
weekly paper, who, he did not doubt, would employ
me in that way, provided he should find me
duly qualified; but upon enquiry, I understood,
that this journal was calculated to foment divisions
in the commonwealth, and therefore I desired
to be excused from engaging in it. —He
then proposed that I should write something in the
poetical way, which I might dispose of to a
bookseller for a pretty sum of ready money, and
perhaps establish my own character into the bargain; 
this event would infallibly procure friends; 
and my tragedy would appear next season to the
best advantage, by being supported both by interest
and reputation. —I was charmed with this
prospect, and having heard what friends Mr. Pope
acquired by his pastorals, set about a work of that
kind, and in less than six weeks, composed as
many ecclogues, which I forthwith offered to an
eminent bookseller, who desired I would leave
them for his perusal, and he would give me an
answer in two days. —After the end of that time, I
went to him, when he returned the poems, telling
me, they would not answer his purpose, and
sweetened his refusal, by saying there were some
good clever lines in them. —Not a little dejected
at his rebuff, which, I learned from Mr. O Varnish,
was owing to the opinion of another author,
whom this bookseller always consulted on these
occasions, I applied to another person of the
same profession, who told me, that the town was
cloyed with pastorals, and advised me, if I intended
to profit by my talents, to write something 

satirical or luscious, such as the Button Hole, Shocky
and Towzer, the Leaky Vessel, &c.—and yet this
was a man in years, who wore a reverend periwig,
looked like a senator, and went regularly to
church. —Be that as it will, I scorned to
prostitute my pen in the manner he proposed, and
carried my papers to a third, who assured me,
that poetry was intirely out of his way; and
asked, if I had got never a piece of secret history,
thrown into a series of letters, or a volume
of adventures, such as those of Robinson Crusoe,
and Colonel Jack, or a collection of conundrums,
wherewith to entertain the plantations. —Being
quite unfurnished for this dealer, I had recourse
to another with as little success, and I verily believe
was rejected by the whole trade. 
I was afterwards persuaded to offer myself as a
translator, and accordingly repaired to a person,
who was said to entertain numbers of that chass
in his pay, he assured me, he had already a
great deal of that work on his hands, which he
did not know what to do with; observed that
translation was a meer drug, that branch of literature
being overstocked by an inundation of authors
from North Britain; and asked what I would
expect per sheet, for rendering the Latin classicks
into English. —That I might not make myself too
cheap, I determined to set a high price upon
my qualifications, and demanded a guinea for
every translated sheet. —“ A guinea! (cried
he, staring at me) then paused a little, and said,
he had no occasion for my service at present. —I
found my error, and resolving to make amends,
fell one half in my demand; upon which he
stared at me again, and told me his hands were 

full. —I attempted others, without finding employment,
and was actually reduced to a very uncomfortable
prospect, when I bethought myself
of offering my talents to the printers of half-penny
ballads, and other such occasional essays
as are hawked about the streets. —With this view,
I applied to one of the most noted and vociferous
of this tribe, who directed me to a person
whom I found entertaining a whole crowd of
them with gin, bread and cheese; he carried me
into a little back parlour, very neatly furnished,
where I signified my desire of being enrolled among
his writers; and was asked, what kind of
composition I professed? —Understanding that my
inclination leaned towards poetry, he expressed
his satisfaction, telling me, one of his poets had
lost his senses, and was confined in Bedlam, and
the other was become dozed with drinking drams; 
so that he had not done any thing tolerable these
many weeks. —When I proposed, that we should
enter into terms of agreement, he gave me to understand,
that his bargains were always conditional,
and his authors paid in proportion to the
sale of their works. 
Having therefore settled these conditions, which
(I do assure you) were not very advantageous to
me, he assigned me a subject for a ballad, which
was to be finished in two hours; and I retired to
my garret in order to perform his injunction. — 
As the theme happened to suit my fancy, I compleated
a pretty sort of an ode, within the time
prescribed, and brought it to him, big with hope
of profit and applause. He read it in a twinkling,
and to my utter astonishment, told me, it would
not do; though indeed, he owned I wrote a
good hand, and spelled very well, but my language 

was too high flown, and of consequence not at
all adapted to the capacity and taste of his customers. 
—I promised to rectify that mistake, and
in half an hour humbled my stile to the comprehension
of vulgar readers; he approved of the
alteration, and gave me some hopes of succeeding
in time, though he observed, that my performance
was very deficient in that quaintness of
expression that pleases the multitude: However,
to encourage me, he ventured the expence of
printing and paper, and, if I remember a-right,
my share of the sale amounted to four pence half-penny. 
From that day, I studied the Grub-street manner
with great diligence, and at length became
such a proficient, that my works were in great
request among the most polite of the chairmen,
draymen, hackney-coachmen, footmen and serving
maids: Nay, I have enjoyed the pleasure of
seeing my productions adorned with cuts, pasted
upon the wall as ornaments in beer-cellars and
cobler's stalls; and have actually heard them
sung in clubs of substantial tradesmen. —But
empty praise (you know, my dear friend) will
not supply the cravings of nature. —I found myself
in danger of starving in the midst of all my
fame; for of ten songs I composed, it was well
if two had the good fortune to please. — 
For this reason I turned my thoughts to prose,
and during a tract of gloomy weather, published
an apparition, on the substance of which I subsisted
very comfortably a whole month: I have
made many a good meal upon a monster; a rape
has often afforded me great satisfaction; but a
murder, well-timed, was my never-failing resource. 
What then? I was a most miserable slave to 

my employers, who expected to be furnished at a
minute's warning with prose and verse, just as
they thought the circumstances of the times required,
whether the inclination was absent or present. 
Upon my sincerity, Mr. Random, I have
been so much pestered and besieged by these children
of clamour, that my life became a burden
to me.
