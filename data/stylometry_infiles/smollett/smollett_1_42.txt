He contemplates Majesty and its satellites in
eclipse. 
This expedition being happily finished, general
Macleaver put the whole army,
navy, transports and scene of action, into a canvas
bag, the prince unsaddled his nose, and
captain Minikin being admitted, our hero was
introduced in form. Very gracious was the
reception he met with from his majesty, who
with a most princely demeanour, welcomed
him to court, and even seated him on his right
hand, in token of particular regard. True it
is, this presence-chamber was not so superb, nor
the appearance of the king so magnificent, as
to render such an honour intoxicating to any
person of our hero's coolness and discretion:
in lieu of tapestry the apartment was hung with
half-penny ballads, a truckle-bed without curtains
supplied the place of a canopy, and instead
of a crown his majesty wore a woolen
night-cap. Yet, in spite of these disadvantages,
there was an air of dignity in his deportment,
and a nice physiognomist would have perceived 

something majestic in the features of his
countenance. 
He was certainly a personage of a very prepossessing
mien; his manners were engaging; 
his conversation agreeable; and any man whose
heart was subject to the meltings of humanity,
would have deplored his distress, and looked
upon him as a most pathetic instance of that
miserable reverse, to which all human grandeur
is exposed. His fall was even greater than
that of Belisarius, who after having obtained
many glorious victories over the enemies of his
country, is said to have been reduced to such
extremity of indigence, that in his old age,
when he was deprived of his eye sight, he sat
upon the high way like a common mendicant,
imploring the charity of passengers, in the piteous
exclamation of Date obolum Belisario; that
is, “Spare a farthing to your poor old soldier
Belisarius.” I say, this general's disgrace was
not so remarkable as that of Theodore, because
he was the servant of Justinian, consequently
his fortune depended upon the nod of
that emperor; whereas the other actually possessed
the throne of sovereignty by the best of
all titles, namely, the unanimous election of
the people over whom he reigned; and attracted
the eyes of all Europe, by the efforts he
made in breaking the bands of oppression, and
vindicating that liberty which is the birthright
of man. 
The English of former days, alike renowned
for generosity and valour, treated those hostile
princes whose fate it was to wear their chains,
with such delicacy of benevolence, as even dispelled
the horrors of captivity; but, their posterity 

of this refined age, feel no compunction
at seeing an unfortunate monarch, their former
friend, ally, and partizan, languish amidst
the miseries of a loathsome goal, for a paultry
debt contracted in their own service. But moralizing
apart, our hero had not long conversed
with this extraordinary debtor, who, in his
present condition, assumed no other title than
that of Baron, than he perceived in him a spirit
of Quixotism, which all his experience, together
with the vicissitudes of his fortune, had
not been able to overcome; not that his ideas
soared to such a pitch of extravagant hope as
that which took possession of his mess-mates,
who frequently quarrelled one with another,
about the degrees of favour to which they
should be intitled after the king's restoration; 
but he firmly believed that affairs would speedily
take such a turn in Italy, as would point
out to the English court, the expediency of employing
him again; and this persuasion seemed
to support him against every species of poverty
and mortification. 
While they were busy in trimming the balance
of power on the other side of the Alps,
their deliberations were interrupted by the arrival
of a scullion, who came to receive their
orders touching the bill of fare for dinner, and
his majesty found much more difficulty in settling
this important concern, than in compromising
all the differences between the emperor
and the queen of Spain. At length, however,
General Macleaver undertook the office of
purveyor for his prince; captain Minikin insisted
upon treating the count, and in a little
time the table was covered with a cloth, which, 

for the sake of my delicate readers, I shall not
attempt to describe. 
At this period, they were joined by Sir Mungo
Barebones, who having found means to purchase
a couple of mutton chops, had cooked a
mess of broth, which he now brought in a saucepan
to the general rendezvous: this was the
most remarkable object which had hitherto
presented itself to the eyes of Fathom: being
naturally of a meagre habit, he was by indigence
and hard study wore almost to the bone,
and so bended towards the earth, that, in walking,
his body described at least 150 degrees of
a circle. The want of stockings and shoes he
supplied with a jockey straight boot and an
half jack. His thighs and middle were cased
in a monstrous pair of brown trunk breeches,
which the keeper bought for his use, from the
executor of a Dutch seaman who had lately
died in the jail: his shirt retained no signs of
its original colour, his body was shrouded in
an old greasy tattered plaid night gown; a
blue and white handkerchief surrounded his
head, and his looks betokened that immense
load of care, which he had voluntarily incurred
for the eternal salvation of sinners. Yet
this figure, uncouth as it was, made his compliments
to our adventurer in terms of the most
elegant address, and in the course of conversation,
disclosed a great fund of valuable knowledge. 
He had appeared in the great world,
and bore divers offices of dignity and trust,
with universal applause: his courage was undoubted,
his morals were unimpeached, and his
person held in great veneration and esteem; 
when his evil genius engaged him in the study 

of Hebrew, and the mysteries of the Jewish
religion, which fairly disordered his brain, and
rendered him incapable of managing his temporal
affairs. When he ought to have been
employed in the functions of his post, he was
always rapt in visionary conferences with Moses
on the Mount; rather than regulate the
œconomy of his houshold, he chuse to exert
his endeavours in settling the precise meaning
of the word Elohim; and having discovered
that now the period was come, when the Jews
and Gentiles would be converted, he postponed
every other consideration, in order to facilitate
that great and glorious event. 
By this time, Ferdinand had seen every
member of the club, except the French chevalier,
who seemed to be quite neglected by
the society; for his name was not once mentioned
during this communication, and they
sat down to dinner, without asking whether
he was dead or alive. The king regaled himself
with a plate of ox-cheek; the major, who
complained that his appetite had forsaken him,
amused himself with some forty hard eggs, malaxed
with salt butter; the knight indulged
upon his soup and bouille, and the captain entertained
our adventurer with a neck of veal
roasted, with potatoes; but before Fathom
could make use of his knife and fork, he was
summoned to the door, where he found the
chevalier in great agitation, his eyes sparkling
like coals of fire. 
Our hero was not a little surprized at this
apparition, who having asked pardon for the
freedom he had used, observed; that understanding
the count was a foreigner, he could 

not dispense with appealing to him concerning
an outrage he had suffered from the keeper,
who, without any regard to his rank, or misfortunes,
had been base enough to refuse him
credit for a few necessaries, until he could
have a remittance from his steward in France; 
he therefore conjured count Fathom, as a stranger
and nobleman like himself, to be the messenger
of defiance, which he resolved to send
to that brutal goaler, that for the future he
might learn to make proper distinctions in the
exercise of his function. 
Fathom, who had no inclination to offend
this choleric Frenchman, assured him that he
might depend upon his friendship; and in the
mean time, prevailed upon him to accept of a
small supply, in consequence of which, he procured
a pound of sausages, and joined the rest
of the company without delay; making a very
suitable addition to such an assemblage of rarities. 
Tho' his age did not exceed thirty
years, his beard, which was of a brindled hue,
flowed down, like Aaron's, to his middle; upon
his legs he wore red stockings rolled up over
the joint of the knee, his breeches were of
blue drab with vellum button holes, and garters
of gold lace, his waistcoat of scarlet, his
coat of rusty black cloath, his hair twisted into
a ramellie, hung down to his rump, of the colour
of jet, and his hat was adorned with a
white feather. 
This original had formed many ingenious
schemes to increase the glory and grandeur of
France, but was discouraged by cardinal Fleury,
who, in all appearance, jealous of his great
talents, not only rejected his projects, but even 

sent him to prison, on pretence of being
offended at his impertinence. Perceiving, that,
like the prophet, he had no honour in his own
country, he no sooner obtained his release,
than he retired to England, where he was
prompted by his philanthropy, to propose an
expedient to our ministry, which would have
saved a vast effusion of blood and treasure; 
this was an agreement between the queen of
Hungary and the late emperor, to decide their
pretensions by a single combat; in which case
he offered himself as the Bavarian champion; 
but in this endeavour he also proved unsuccessful:
then turning his attention to the delights
of poetry, he became so enamoured of the
muse, that he neglected every other consideration,
and she, as usual, gradually conducted
him to the author's never failing goal; a place
of rest appointed for all those sinners, whom
the profane love of poesy had led astray.
