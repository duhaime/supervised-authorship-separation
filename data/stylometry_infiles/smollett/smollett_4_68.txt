I am seized with a deep melancholy, and become
a sloven—I am relieved by my uncle
—he prevails upon me to engage with his
owners, as surgeon of the ship which he
commands—he makes me a considerable
present—entertains Strap as his steward
—I take my leave of my friends, and go
on board—the ship arrives at the
Downs. 
I shall not make any reflections on this story,
in the course of which the reader must perceive
how egregiously the simplicity and milky
disposition of this worthy man, had been duped
and abused by a set of scoundrels, who were so
habituated to falshood and equivocation, that I
verily believe, they could not utter one syllable
of truth, though their lives depended upon their
sincerity. —Notwithstanding all I had suffered
from the knavery and selfishness of mankind, I
was amazed, and incensed at that base indifference
which suffered such uncommon merit as he
possessed, to languish in obscurity, and struggle
with all the miseries of a loathsome jail—and
should have blessed the occasion that secluded
me from such a perfidious world, had not the remembrance
of the amiable Narcissa, preserved
my attachment to that society of which she constituted
a part. —The picture of that lovely creature
was the constant companion of my solitude: 

How often did I contemplate the resemblance of
those enchanting features that first captivated my
heart! How often did I weep over those endearing
scenes which her image recalled! and
how often did I curse my perfidious fate for having
robbed me of the fair original! In vain did
my imagination flatter me with schemes of
future happiness; surly reason always interposed,
and in a moment overthrew the unsubstantial fabrick,
by chastising the extravagance of my hope,
and representing my unhappy situation in the right
point of view: In vain did I fly for refuge to the
amusements of the place, and engage in the parties
of Jackson, at cards, billiards, nine-pins,
and fives; a train of melancholy thoughts took
possession of my soul, which even the conversation
of Melopoyn could not divert. —I ordered
Strap to inquire every day at Banter's lodgings,
in expectation of hearing again from my charmer:
and my disappointment considerably augmented
my chagrin. —My affectionate valet was infected
with my sorrow, and often sat with me whole
hours without speaking, uttering sigh for sigh,
and shedding tear for tear. —This fellowship increased
our distemper; he became incapable of
business, and was discarded by his master; while
I seeing my money melt away, without any certainty
of deliverance, and in short, all my hopes
frustrated; grew negligent of life, lost all appetite,
and degenerated into such a sloven, that
during the space of two months, I was neither
washed, shifted nor shaved; so that my face rendered
meagre with abstinence, was obscured with
dirt, and overshadowed with hair, and my whole
appearance squalid and even frightful; when, one
day, Strap brought me notice, that there was a 

man below who wanted to speak with me. Roused
at this intelligence, and in full hope of receiving
a letter from the dear object of my love, I run
down stairs with the utmost precipitation, and
found, to my infinite surprize, my generous
uncle Mr. Bowling! Transported at the sight, I
sprung forward to embrace him. Upon which
he started aside with great agility, drew his hanger,
and put himself upon his guard, crying, “Avast,
brother, avast! sheer off—Yo ho! you turnkey,
why don't you keep a better look out?
here's one of your crazy prisoners broke from
his lashings, I do suppose.” —I could not help
laughing heartily at his mistake, which I soon
rectified by my voice, which he instantly recollected,
and shook me by the hand with great affection,
testifying his concern at seeing me in
such a miserable condition. 
I conducted him to my apartment, where, in
presence of Strap, whom I introduced to him as
one of my best friends, he let me know, that he
was just arrived from the coast of Guinea, after
having made a pretty successful voyage, in which
he had acted as mate, until the ship was attacked
by a French privateer; that the captain being
killed during the engagement, he had taken the
command, and was so fortunate as to sink the
enemy; after which he fell in with a merchant
ship from Martinico, laden with sugar, indigo,
and some silver; and by virtue of his letter of
marque, attacked, took, and brought her safe into
Kinsale in Ireland, where she was condemned
as a lawful prize; by which means, he had not
only got a pretty sum of money, but also acquired
the favour of his owners, who had already
conferred upon him the command of a large ship, 

mounted with twenty nine-pounders, ready to sail
upon a very advantageous voyage, which he was
not at liberty to discover—And he assured me,
that it was with the greatest difficulty he had
sound me, in consequence of a direction left for
him at his lodgings in Wapping. 
I was rejoiced beyond measure, at this account
of his good fortune; and, at his desire, recounted
all the adventures that had happened to me since
we parted. —When he understood the particulars
of Strap's attachment to me, he squeezed his hand
very cordially, and promised to make a man of
him; and giving me ten guineas for my present
occasion, took a direction for the taylor who arrested
me, and went away, in order to discharge
the debt, telling me at parting, that he would
soon fetch up all my lee-way with a wet sail. 
I was utterly confounded at this sudden transition,
which affected me more than any reverse
I had formerly felt; and a crowd of incoherent
ideas rushed so impetuously upon my imagination,
that my reason could neither separate nor connect
them; when Strap, whose joy had manifested
itself in a thousand fooleries, came into my
room with his shaving utensils, and without any
previous intimation, began to lather my beard,
whistling with great emotion all the while. —I
started from my reverie, and being too well acquainted
with Strap, to trust myself in his hands
while he was under such agitation, desired to be
excused, sent for another barber, and suffered
myself to be trimmed. —Having performed the
ceremony of ablution, I shifted, and dressing in
my gayest apparel, waited for the return of my
uncle, who was agreeably surprized at my sudden
transformation. 

This beneficent kinsman had satisfied my creditor,
and obtained an order for my discharge
so that I was no longer a prisoner; but as I had
some reluctance to part with my friends and fellows
in distress, I prevailed upon Mr. Bowling to
favour us with his company, and invited Mr.
Melopoyn and Jackson to spend the evening at
my apartment, where I regaled them with a supper,
good wine, and the news of my release, on
which they heartily congratulated me, notwithstanding
the loss of my company, which, they
were pleased to say, they would severely feel. — 
As for Jackson, his misfortune made so little impression
on himself, and he was altogether so
loose, indifferent and indiscreet, that I could
scarce pity his situation: But I had conceived a
veneration and friendship for the poet, who was
in all respects, an object much more worthy of
compassion and regard. —When our guests withdrew,
and my uncle had retired, with an intention
to visit me next morning, I made up a bundle
of some linnen, and other necessaries, and bidding
Strap carry them to Mr. Melopoyn's lodging,
went thither myself, and pressed it upon his
acceptance with five guineas, which with much
difficulty he received, assuring me at the same
time, that he should never have it in his power
to make satisfaction. I then asked if I could
serve him any other way, to which he answered,
“You have already done too much,” and unable
to contain the emotions of his soul any longer,
burst into tears, and wept aloud. —Moved at the
spectacle, I left him to his repose, and when my
uncle returned in the morning, represented his character
in such a favourable light, that the honest
seaman was affected with his distress, and determined 

to follow my example, in presenting him with
five pieces more: Upon which, that I might
save him some confusion, I advised Mr. Bowling
to inclose it in a letter to be delivered by Strap,
after we should be gone. 
This was accordingly done. I took a formal
leave of all my acquaintance in the jail, and just as
I was about to step into a hackney-coach at the
gate, Jackson calling me, I returned, and he
asked me in a whisper, if I could lend him a
shilling! His demand being so moderate, and in
all likelihood, the last he would make upon me,
I slipt a guinea into his hand, which he no sooner
perceived, than he cried, “O Jesus! a guinea!” 
then laying hold of a button of my coat, he
broke out into an immoderate fit of laughter
and when his convulsion was ended, told me, I
was an honest fellow, and let me go. —The
coachman was ordered to drive to Mr. Bowling's
lodgings, where, when we arrived, he entered
into a serious discourse with me, on the subject
of my situation, and proposed that I should sail
with him in quality of his Surgeon in which
case, he would put me on a method of getting a
fortune in a few years, by my own industry; and
assured me, that I might expect to inherit all that
he should die possessed of, provided I should survive
him. —Though I was penetrated with a sense of
his generosity, I was startled at a proposal that
offered violence to my love, and signified my
sentiments on that head, which he did not seem
to relish; but observed that love was the fruit
of idleness, that when once I should be employed
in business, and my mind engaged in making
money, I would be no more troubled with these
silly notions, which none but your fair-weather 

Jacks, who have nothing but their pleasure to
mind, ought to entertain. —I was piqued at this
insinuation, which I looked upon as a reproach,
and without giving myself time to deliberate, accepted
his offer. —He was overjoyed at my compliance,
carried me immediately to his chief
owner, with whom a bargain was struck, so that
I could not retract with honour, should I be never
so much disposed thereto. —That I might not
have time to cool, he bid me draw out a list of
medicines for a compliment of five hundred men,
adapted to the distempers of hot climates, and
sufficient for a voyage of eighteen months; and
carry it to a certain wholesale apothecary, who
would also provide me in two well-qualified mates. 
—While I was thus employed, Strap came in,
and looked very blank, when he understood my
resolution: However, after a pause of some minutes,
he insisted upon going along with me; and
at my desire was made ship's steward by captain
Bowling, who promised to be at the expence of
fitting him out, and to lend him two hundred
pounds to purchase an adventure. 
When I had delivered my list of medicines,
chosen a couple of my own countrymen for mates,
and bespoke a set of chirurgical instruments, my
uncle told me, that by his last voyage, he had
cleared almost three thousand pounds, one thousand
of which he would immediately make over and
put into my hands; that he would procure for me
credit to the value of as much more, in such goods
as would turn to best account in the country to
which we were bound; and that although he
looked upon my interest as his own, he would
keep the remaining part of his fortune in his
own disposal, with a view of preserving his independance, 

and the power of punishing me, in
case I should not make a good use of what he had
already bestowed upon me. 
Without troubling the reader with an account of
the effect which this surprizing generosity had upon
my mind, I shall only say, that his promises were
instantly performed, and an invoyce of merchandize
proper for the voyage presented to me,
that I might purchase the goods, and ship them
with all expedition. —In the midst of this hurry
the remembrance of my charming Narcissa often
interposed, and made me the most miserable of
all mortals. I was distracted with the thought of
being torn from her, perhaps, for ever; and
though the hope of seeing her again, might have
supported me under the torments of separation, I
could not reflect upon the anguish she must feel
at parting with me, and the incessant sorrows to
which her tender bosom would be exposed during
my absence, without being pierced with the
deepest affliction! As my imagination was daily
and nightly upon the rack to invent some method
of mitigating this cruel stroke, or at least of
acquitting my love and honour in the opinion of
that gentle creature, I at length stumbled upon
an expedient, with which the reader will be made
acquainted in due time; and in consequence of my
determination, became less uneasy and disturbed. 
My business being finished, and the ship ready to
sail, I resolved to make my last appearance among
my acquaintance at the other end of the town,
where I had not been seen since my imprisonment; 
and as I had, by the advice of my uncle,
taken off some very rich cloaths for sale, I put
on the gayest suit in my possession, and went in
a chair to the coffee-house I used to frequent, 

where I found my friend Banter so confounded
at the magnificence of my dress, that when I
made up to him, he gazed at me with a look of
astonishment, without being able, for some minutes,
to open his lips;—then pulling me aside
by the sleeve, and fixing his eyes on mine, accosted
me in this manner: “Random, where the devil
have you been! eh? —What is the meaning of
all this finery? —Oho! I understand you— 
You are just arrived from the country! what!
the roads are good, eh!—well, Random, you are
a bold fellow, and a lucky fellow!—but take care,
the pitcher goes often to the well, but is broke
at last.” So saying, he pointed to his collar
by which gesture, and the broken hints he
had ejaculated, I found he suspected me of having
robbed on the highway and I laughed very
heartily at his supposition. —Without explaining
myself any farther, I told him he was mistaken
in his conjecture; that I had been for some time
past with the relation of whom he had frequently
heard me speak; and that being to set out
next day upon my travels, I had come thither to
take my leave of my friends, and to receive of him
the money he had borrowed from me, which, now
that I was going abroad, I should have occasion
for. —He was a little disconcerted at this demand; 
but recollecting himself in a moment, swore,
in an affected passion, that I had used him extremely
ill, and he would never forgive me, for
having, by this short warning, put it out of his
power to free himself of an obligation he could
no longer bear. —I could not help smiling at this
pretended delicacy, which I commended highly,
telling him, he needed not be uneasy on that
score, for I would give him a direction to a merchant 

in the city, with whom I would leave a
discharge for the sum, to be delivered upon payment. 
—He professed much joy at this expedient,
and with great eagerness asked the person's name
and place of abode, which he forthwith wrote in
his pocket-book, assuring me, that he would not be
long in my debt. —This affair, which I knew he
would never after think of, being settled to his
satisfaction, I sent cards to all my friends, desiring
the favour of their company at a tavern in
the evening, when they honoured my invitation,
and I had the pleasure of treating them in a very
elegant manner, at which they expressed as
much admiration as applause. Having enjoyed
ourselves till midnight, I took my leave of them
all, being well-nigh stifled with caresses; and
next day I set out with Strap in a post-chaise for
Gravesend, where we went on board, and the
wind serving, weighed anchor in less than twelve
hours. —Without meeting with any accident, we
got as far as the Downs, where we were obliged
to come to an anchor, and wait for an easterly
wind to carry us out of the Channel.
