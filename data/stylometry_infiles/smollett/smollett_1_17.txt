His success begets a blind security, by which he
is once again well nigh entrapped in his Dulcinea's apartment. 
In this manner did the crafty Fathom turn
to account those ingratiating qualifications
he inherited from nature; and maintain, with
incredible assiduity and circumspection, an amorous
correspondence with two domestic rivals,
who watched the conduct of each other,
with the most indefatigable virulence of envious
suspicion, until an accident happened,
which had well-nigh overturned the bark of
his policy, and induced him to alter the course,
that he might not be shipwrecked on the rocks
that began to multiply in the prosecution of
his present voyage. 

The jeweller, who, as a German, wanted
neither pride nor ostentation, never failed to
celebrate the anniversary of his birth, by an
annual feast granted to his neighbours and
friends; and, on these occasions, was accustomed
to wear that chain, which though bequeathed
to his daughter, he considered as an ornament
appertaining to the family, whereof he
himself was head: accordingly, when the time
of this festival revolved, he, as usual, ordered
Wilhelmina to surrender it for the day. This
injunction, the reader will perceive, our young
lady was in no condition to obey; she had,
however, foreseen the demand, and contrived
a scheme of behaviour, for the occasion, which
she forthwith put in execution. 
With an air of uncommon chearfulness purposely
assumed, she retired to her closet, on
pretence of complying with his desire, and having
employed a few minutes in rummaging her
drawers, and disordering her moveables, uttered
a loud shriek, that brought her father instantly
into the apartment, where he found his
daughter tossing about her cloaths and trinkets,
with violent demonstrations of disorder and affright,
and heard her in a lamentable strain declare,
that she was robbed of her chain, and
for ever undone. This was so far from being
an agreeable intimation to the jeweller, that he
was struck dumb with astonishment and vexation,
and it was not till after a long pause, that
he pronounced the word “Sacrament!” with
an emphasis, denoting the most mortifying surprize. 
Soon as that exclamation escaped from his
lips, he flew to the scrutore as if instinctively, 

and joining Wilhelmina in her occupation,
tumbled its whole contents upon the floor in
a trice. 
While he was thus employed, in the most
expressive silence, the wife of his bosom chanced
to pass that way, and seeing them both occupied,
with such violence and trepidation, believed
at first, that they were certainly actuated
by the spirit of frenzy; but when she interposed,
by asking with great earnestness, the cause
of such transports and distracted behaviour; 
and heard her husband reply with an accent
of despair, “The chain! the chain of my
forefathers is no more.” She immediately
justified his emotion, by undergoing the same
alarm, and without further hesitation, engaged
herself in the search, beginning with a song,
which might be compared to the hymn of battle
among the Greeks, or rather more aptly,
to that which the Spartan females sung round
the altar of Diana, surnamed Orthian: for, it
was attended with strange gesticulations, and
in the course of utterance, became so loud and
shrill, that the guests, who were by this time
partly assembled, being confounded at the clamour,
rushed towards the place from whence
it seemed to proceed, and found their landlord,
with his wife and daughter in the attitudes
of distraction and despair. 
When they understood the nature of the
case, they condoled the family on their misfortune,
and would have retired, on the supposition
that it would defeat the mirthful intent of
their meeting; but the jeweller, mustering up
his whole temper and hospitality, intreated
them to excuse his disorder, and favour him 

with their company, which, he observed, was
now more than ever wanted, to dispel the melancholy
ideas inspired by his loss. Notwithstanding
this apology, and the efforts he made
in the sequel, to entertain his friends with jollity
and good humour, his heart was so linked
to the chain, that he could not detach himself
from the thoughts of it, which invaded him at
short intervals, in such qualms as effectually
spoiled his appetite, and hindered his digestion. 
He revolved within himself, the circumstances
of his disaster, and in canvassing all the probable
means, by which the chain could be stolen,
concluded that the deed must have been
done by some person in the family, who, in
consequence of having access to his daughter's
chamber, had either found the drawer left open
by her carelessness and neglect, or found
means to obtain a false key, by some waxen
impression: for the locks of the escritore were
safe and uninjured. His suspicion being thus
confined within his own house, sometimes
pitched upon his workmen, and sometimes upon
his wife, who, he thought, was the more likely
to practise such finesse, as she considered
Wilhelmina in the light of a daughter-in-law,
whose interest interfered with her own, and
who had often harangued to him in private, on
the folly of leaving this very chain in the young
lady's possession. 
The more he considered this subject, he
thought he saw the more reason to attribute the
damage he had sustained, to the machinations
of his spouse, who, he did not doubt, was disposed
to feather her own nest, at the expence 

of him and his heirs, and who, with the same
honest intention, had already secreted, for her
private use, those inconsiderable jewels which
of late had at different times been missing. 
Arroused by these sentiments, he resolved to
retalliate her own schemes, by contriving means
to visit her cabinet in secret, and, if possible, to
rob the robber, of the spoils she had gathered
to his prejudice, without coming to any explanation,
which might end in domestic turmoils
and eternal disquiet. 
While the husband exercised his reflection in
this manner, his innocent mate did not allow
the powers of her imagination to rest in idleness
and sloth. Her observations touching the
loss of the chain were such, as a suspicious woman,
biassed by hatred and envy, would naturally
make. To her it seemed highly improbable,
that a thing of such value, so carefully
deposited, should vanish without the connivance
of its keeper, and without much expence
of conjecture, divined the true manner in
which it was conveyed. The sole difficulty
that occurred in the researches of her sagacity,
was to know the gallant, who had been
favoured with such a pledge of Wilhelmina's
affection; for as the reader will easily imagine,
she never dreamed of viewing Ferdinand in
that odious perspective. In order to satisfy
her curiosity, discover this happy favourite,
and be revenged on her petulant rival, she
prevailed upon the jeweller to employ a scout,
who should watch all night upon the stair,
without the knowledge of any other person in
the family, alledging, that, in all livelihood,
the house-maid gave private admittance to 

some lover, who was the author of all the
losses they had lately suffered, and that they
might possibly detect him in his nocturnal adventures; 
and observing that it would be imprudent
to intimate their design to Wilhelmina,
lest through the heedlessness and indiscretion
of youth, she might chance to divulge the
secret, so as to frustrate their aim. 
A Swiss, in whose honesty the German
could confide, being hired for this purpose,
was posted in a dark corner of the stair-case,
within a few paces of the door, which he was
directed to watch, and actually stood centinel
three nights, without perceiving the least object
of suspicion; but on the fourth, the evil
stars of our adventurer conducted him to the
spot, on his voyage to the apartment of his
Dulcinea, with whom he had pre-concerted
the assignation. Having made the signal,
which consisted of two gentle taps on her door,
he was immediately admitted, and the Swiss
no sooner saw him fairly housed, than he crept
softly to the other door that was left open for
the purpose, and gave immediate intimation of
what he had perceived: this intelligence, however,
he could not convey so secretly, but the
lovers, who were always vigilant upon these
occasions, overheard a sort of commotion in
the jeweller's chamber, the cause of which
their apprehension was ingenious enough to
comprehend. 
We have formerly observed, that our adventurer
could not make his retreat by the
door, without running a very great risque of
being detected, and the expedient of the chimney
he had no inclination to repeat; so that 

he found himself in a very uncomfortable dilemma,
and was utterly abandoned by all his
invention and address; when his mistress, in a
whisper, desired him to begin a dialogue, aloud,
in an apology, importing, that he had
mistaken the door; and that his intention was
to visit her father, touching a ring belonging
to the young count Melville, which, she knew,
Fathom had put into his hands, in order to be
altered. 
Ferdinand seizing the hint, availed himself of
it, without delay, and unbolting the door, pronounced,
in an audible voice, “Upon my honour,
Mademoiselle, you wrong my intention,
if you imagine I came hither with any disrespectful
or dishonourable motive: I have business
with your father, which cannot be delayed
till to-morrow, without manifest prejudice to
my friend and myself; therefore I took the
liberty of visiting him at these untimely hours; 
and it has been my misfortune to mistake the
door in the dark. I beg pardon for my involuntary
intrusion; and again assure you, that
nothing was farther from my thoughts, than
any design to violate that respect which I have
always entertained for you and your father's
family.” 
To this remonstrance, which was distinctly
heard by the German and his wife, who, by
this time, stood listening at the door, the
young lady replied in a shrill accent of displeasure,
“Sir, I am bound to believe that all
your actions are conducted by honour; but,
you must give me leave to tell you, that your
mistake is a little extraordinary, and your visit,
even to my father at this time of the night, altogether 

unseasonable, if not mysterious. As
for the interruption I have suffered in my repose,
I impute it to my own forgetfulness, in
leaving my door unlocked, and blame myself
so severely for the omission that I shall to morrow
put it out of my own power to be guilty
of the like for the future, by ordering the passage
to be nailed up; mean while, if you would
persuade me of your well-meaning, you will
instantly withdraw, lest my reputation should
suffer by your continuance in my apartment.” 
“Madam, answered our hero, I will not
give you an opportunity to repeat the command,
which I shall forthwith obey, after having
intreated you once more, to forgive the
disturbance I have given.” So saying, he gently
opened the door, and at sight of the German
and his wife, who, he well knew, waited
for his exit, started back, and gave tokens of
confusion, which was partly real, and partly affected. 
The jeweller, fully satisfied with Fathom's declaration to his daughter, received
him with a complaisant look, and in order to
alleviate his concern, gave him to understand
that he already knew the reason of his being
in that apartment, and desired to be informed
of what had procured him the honour to see
him at such a juncture. 
“My dear friend, said our adventurer, pretending
to recollect himself with difficulty, I
am utterly ashamed and confounded to be discovered
in this situation; but as you have over-heard
what past between Mademoiselle and
me, I know you will do justice to my intention
and forgive my mistake. After begging pardon
for having intruded upon your family at 

these hours, I must now tell you, that my cousin
count Melville was sometime ago so much
misrepresented to his mother, by certain malicious
informers, who delight in sowing discord
in private families, that she actually believed
her son an extravagant spendthrift, who had
not only consumed his remittances in the most
riotous scenes of disorder, but also indulged a
pernicious appetite for gaming to such a degree,
that he had lost all his cloaths and jewels at
play. In consequence of such false information,
she expostulated with him in a severe letter,
and desired he would transmit to her that
ring which is in your custody, it being a family
stone, for which she expressed an inestimable
value. The young gentleman, in his answer
to her reproof, endeavoured to vindicate himself
from the aspersions which had been cast
upon his character, and with regard to the
ring, told her it was at present in the hands of
a jeweller, in order to be new set, according to
her own directions, and that whenever it should
be altered, he would send it home to her by
some safe conveyance. This account the good
lady took for an evasion, and upon that supposition,
has again written to him, in such a provoking
stile, that although the letter arrived
but half an hour ago, he is determined to dispatch
a courier before morning with the mischievous
ring, for which, in compliance with
the impetuosity of his temper, I have taken
the freedom to disturb you at this unseasonable
hour. 
The German paid implicit faith to every circumstance
of this story, which indeed could
not well be supposed to be invented extempore; 

the ring was immediately restored, and our
adventurer took his leave, congratulating himself
upon his signal deliverance from the snare
in which he had fallen.
