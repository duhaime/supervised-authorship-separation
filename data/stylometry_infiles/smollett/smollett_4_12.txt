The highwayman is taken—we are detained
as evidences against him—proceed to the
next village—he escapes—we arrive at
another inn, where we go to bed—in the
night we are awaked by a dreadful adventure
—next night we lodge at the house of
a school-master—our treatment there. 
Strap and I were about to depart on our
journey, when we perceived a croud on the
road, coming towards us, shouting and hollowing
all the way. As it approached, we could discern
a man on horse-back in the middle, with his
hands tied behind him, whom we soon knew to
be Rifle. —This highwayman not being so well
mounted as the two servants who went in pursuit
of him, was soon overtaken, and after having
discharged his pistols, made prisoner without any
further opposition. They were carrying him in
triumph, amidst the acclamations of the country
people, to a justice of peace in a neighbouring
village, but stopt at our inn to join their companion
and take refreshment. When Rifle was
dismounted, and placed in the yard, within a circle
of peasants armed with pitch-forks, I was
amazed to see what a pitiful dejected fellow
he now appeared, who had but a few hours ago, 

filled me with so much terror and confusion. — 
My companion was so much encouraged by this
alteration in his appearance, that going up to the
thief, he presented his clenched fists to his nose,
and declared, that he would either cudgel or
box with the prisoner for a guinea, which he immediately
produced; and began to strip—but
was dissuaded from this adventure by me, who
represented to him the folly of the undertaking,
as Rifle was now in the hands of justice, which
would, no doubt, give us all satisfaction enough. 
—But what made me repent of our impertinent
curiosity, was our being detained by the captors,
as evidence against him, when we were just going
to set forward. However, there was no remedy; 
we were obliged to comply, and accordingly joined
in the cavalcade, which luckily took the same road
that we proposed. —About the twilight we arrived
at the place of our destination, but as the justice
was gone to visit a gentleman in the country, with
whom he would probably stay all night, the robber
was confined in an empty garret three stories
high, from which it seemed impossible for him to
escape: this, nevertheless, was the case; for next
morning, when they went up stairs, to bring him
before the justice, the bird was flown, having got
out at the window upon the leads, from whence
he continued his rout along the tops of the adjoining
houses, and got into another garret window,
where he sculked, until the family were asleep, at
which time he ventured down stairs, and let himself
out by the street door, which was found open. This
event was a great disappointment to those that apprehended
him, who were flushed with hopes of the
reward; but gave me great joy, as I was permitted
now to continue my journey without any further
molestation. —Resolving to make up for the small 

progress we had hitherto made, we this day travelled
with great vigour, and before night got to a market-town
twenty miles from the place from whence
we set out in the morning, without meeting any
adventure worth notice. —Here having taken
up our lodging at an inn, I found myself so fatigued,
that I began to despair of performing our
journey on foot, and desired Strap to enquire if
there was any waggon, return-horses, or other
cheap carriage in this place, to depart for London
to-morrow or next day. —He was informed, that
the waggon from Newcastle for London had
halted here two nights ago, and that it would
be an easy matter to overtake it, if not the next
day, at farthest the day after the next. —This
piece of news gave us some satisfaction, and after
making a hearty supper on hashed mutton, we
were shewn to our room, which contained two
beds, the one allotted for us, and the other
for a very honest gentleman, who, we were told,
was then drinking below. Though we could have
very well dispensed with his company, we were
glad to submit to this disposition, as there was
not another bed empty in the house; and accordingly
went to rest, after having secured our
baggage under the bolster. About two or three
a-clock in the morning, I was waked out of a very
profound sleep, by a dreadful noise in the chamber,
which did not fail to throw me into an agony
of consternation, when I heard these words
pronounced with a terrible voice. —“Blood and
wounds! run the halbert into the guts of him
that's next you, and I'll blow the other's brains
out presently.” —This dreadful salutation had
no sooner reached the ears of Strap, than starting
out of bed, he run against some body in the dark, 

and overturned him in an instant, at the same
time bawling out, “Fire! murder! fire! which
in a moment alarmed the whole house, and filled
our chamber with a croud of naked people. 
—When lights were brought, the occasion of all
this disturbance soon appeared; which was no
other than our fellow lodger, whom we found
lying on the floor scratching his head, with a
look testifying the utmost astonishment, at the
concourse of apparitions that surrounded him. — 
This honest gentleman was, it seems, a recruiting
serjeant, who having listed two country fellows
over-night, dreamed they had mutinied, and
threatened to murder him and the drummer who
was along him. —This made such an impression
on his imagination, that he got up in his sleep,
and expressed himself as above. —When our apprehension
of danger vanished, the company beheld
one another with great surprize and mirth; 
but what attracted the notice of every one, was
our landlady with nothing on her but her shift
and a large pair of buckskin breeches with the
backside before, which she had slipt on in the
hurry, and her husband with her petticoat about
his shoulders: one had wrapt himself in a blanket,
another was covered with a sheet, and the
drummer who had given his only shirt to be
washed, appeared in querpo with the bolster rolled
about his middle. —When this affair was discussed,
every body retired to his own apartment,
the serjeant slipt into bed, and my companion and
I slept without any further disturbance till the
morning, when we got up, went to breakfast,
paid our reckoning, and set forward in expectation
of overtaking the waggon; in which, however,
we were disappointed that day. As we 

exerted ourselves more than usual, I found myself
quite spent with fatigue, when we entered a
small village in the twilight. We enquired for a
publick house, and were directed to one of a very
sorry appearance. At our entrance the landlord,
who seemed to be a venerable old man, with
long grey hair, rose from a table placed by a
large fire in a very neat paved kitchin, and with a
chearful countenance accosted us in these words: 
“Salvete Pueri—ingredimini.” —I was not a little
pleased to hear our host speak Latin, because I
was in hopes of recommending myself to him by
my knowledge in that language; I therefore answered
without hesitation,—Dissolve frigus, ligna
super foco.—large reponens. —I had no sooner pronounced
these words, than the old gentleman running
towards me, shook me by the hand, crying,
“—Fili mi dilectissime! unde venis!—a superis, ni
fallor?”—in short, finding we were both read
in the classicks, he did not know how to testify
his regard, but ordered his daughter, a jolly rosy-cheeked
damsel, who was his sole domestic, to bring
us a bottle of his quadrimum.—repeating from
Horace at the same time, “Deprome quadrimum
sabinâ, O Thaliarche, merum diotâ.” This
quadrimum was excellent ale of his own brewing,
of which he told us he had always an amphora
four years old, for the use of himself and friends. 
—In the course of our conversation, which was
interlarded with scraps of Latin, we understood
that this facetious person was a school-master,
whose income being small, he was fain to keep a
glass of good liquor for the entertainment of
passengers, by which he made shift to make the
two ends of the year meet. —“I am this day,
said he, the happiest old fellow in his majesty's 

dominions. —My wife, rest her soul, is in
heaven. My daughter is to be married next
week;—but the two chief pleasures of my
life are these (pointing to the bottle and a large
edition of Horace that lay one the table.) I
am old, 'tis true,—what then? the more reason
I should enjoy the small share of life that remains,
as my friend Flaccus advises:— 
Tu ne quæsieris scire (nefas.) Quem, mihi
quem tibi finem dii dederint—Carpe diem
quam minimum credula postero.” —As he was
very inquisitive about our affairs, we made no
scruple of acquainting him with our situation,
which when he had learned, he enriched us with
advices how to behave in the world, telling us that
he was no stranger to the deceits of mankind. 
—In the mean time he ordered his daughter to
lay a fowl to the fire for supper, for he was resolved
this night to regale his friends—permittens
divis cætera. —While our entertainment
was preparing, our host recounted the adventures
of his own life, which, as they contain nothing
remarkable, I forbear to rehearse. When we
had fared sumptuously and drank several bottles
of his quadrimum, I expressed a desire of going
to rest, which was with some difficulty complied
with, after he had informed us that we should
overtake the waggon by noon next day; and that
there was room enough in it for half a dozen,
there being only four passengers as yet in that
convenience. —Before my comrade and I fell
asleep we had some conversation about the good
humour of our landlord, which gave Strap such
an idea of his benevolence, that he was positive
we should pay nothing for our lodging and entertainment. 
—“Don't you observe, said he, 

that he has conceived a particular affection
for us,—nay, even treated us at supper with
extraordinary fare, which, to be sure, we
should not of ourselves, have called for?” — 
I was partly of Strap's opinion; but the experience
I had of the world made me suspend my belief
till to-morrow morning, when, getting up betimes,
we breakfasted with our host and his daughter,
on hasty-pudding and ale, and desired to know
what we had to pay. —“Biddy will let you
know, gentlemen, said he, for I never mind
these matters. —Money-matters are beneath
the concern of one who lives on the Horatian
plan. —Crescentem sequitur cura pecuniam.” 
Mean while Biddy having consulted a slate that
hung in a corner, told us, our reckoning came to
8s. 7d. —“Eight shillings and seven pence!
cried Strap, 'tis impossible—you must be mistaken,
young woman.” —“Reckon again, child,
(says her father, very deliberately) perhaps you
have miscounted.” —“No indeed, father, (she
replied) I know my business better.” —I could
contain my indignation no longer, but said it
was a very unconscionable bill, and demanded
to know the particulars; upon which the old
man got up, muttering “Ay, ay, let us see the
particulars,—that's but reasonable.” —And
taking pen, ink, and paper, wrote the following 

Items:s.d.

To a fowl and sausages26

As he had not the appearance of a common publican,
and had raised a sort of veneration in me
by his demeanor the preceding night, it was not
in my power to upbraid him as he deserved; 
therefore I contented myself with saying, I was
sure he did not learn to be an extortioner from
Horace. He answered, “I was a but young man
and did not know the world, or I would not
tax him with extortion, whose only aim was
to live contentus parvo, and keep off importuna
pauperies.” —My fellow-traveller could not so
easily put up with this imposition; but swore he
should either take one third of the money, or go
without. —While we were engaged in this dispute,
I perceived the daughter go out, and conjecturing
the occasion, immediately paid the
exorbitant demand, which was no sooner done,
than Biddy returned with two stout fellows, who
came in on pretence of taking their morning
draught; but in reality to frighten us into compliance. 
—Just as we departed, Strap, who was
half distracted on account of this piece of expence,
went up to the school-master, and grinning in
his face, pronounced with great emphasis; “Semper
avarus eget.” —To which the pedant
replied, with a malicious smile;—“Animum rege,
qui, nisi paret, imperat.”
