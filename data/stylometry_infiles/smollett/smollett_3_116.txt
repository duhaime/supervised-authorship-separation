These associates commit an assault upon Crabtree,
for which they are banished from the Fleet. 
Peregrine begins to feel the effects of confinement. 
Our adventurer having dined at the ordinary,
and in the afternoon retired to his
own apartment, as usual, with his friend Cadwallader; 
Hatchway and his associate, after they
had been obliged to discuss the provision for which
they had paid, renewed their conference upon
the old subject; and Pipes giving his mess-mate
to understand, that Peregrine's chief confident
was the old deaf batchelor, whom he had seen at
his lodging the preceding day, Mr. Hatchway,
in his great penetration, discovered, that the
young gentleman's obstinacy proceeded from the
advice of the Misanthrope, whom, for that reason,
it was their business to chastise. Pipes entered
into this opinion the more willingly, as he
had all along believed the senior to be a sort of
wizzard, or some caco-dæmon, whom it was not
very creditable to be acquainted with. Indeed,
he had been inspired with this notion by the 

insinuations of Hadgi, who had formerly dropped
some hints touching. Crabtree's profound knowledge
in the magic art; mentioning, in particular,
his being possessed of the philosopher's stone; 
an assertion to which Tom had given implicit
credit, until his master was sent to prison for
debt, when he could no longer suppose Cadwallader
lord of such a valuable secret, else he would
have certainly procured the enlargement of his
most intimate friend. 
With these sentiments he espoused the resentment
of Hatchway; and they determined to seize
the supposed conjurer, with the first opportunity,
on his return from his visit to Peregrine, and,
without hesitation, exercise upon him the discipline
of the pump. This plan they would have
executed that same evening, had not the misanthrope
luckily withdrawn himself, by accident,
before it was dark, and even before they had intelligence
of his retreat. But, next day, they
kept themselves upon the watch 'till he appeared,
and Pipes lifting his hat, as Crabtree passed, “O
damn ye, old Dunny (said he), you and I must
grapple by and by; and, a'gad! I shall lie so near
your quarter, that your ear-ports will let in the
sound, tho'f they were double caulked with
oakum.” 
The misanthrope's ears were not quite so fast
closed, but that they received this intimation; 
which, tho' delivered in terms that he did not
well understand, had such an effect upon his apprehension,
that he signified his doubts to Peregrine,
observing, that he did not much like the
looks of that same ruffian with the wooden leg. 
Pickle assured him, he had nothing to fear from
the two sailors, who could have no cause of resentment 

against him; or, if they had, would not
venture to take any step, which they knew must
block up all the avenues to that reconcilement,
about which they were so anxious; and, moreover,
give such offence to the governor of the
place, as would infallibly induce him to expel
them both from his territories. 
Notwithstanding this assurance, the young gentleman
was not so confident of the lieutenant's
discretion, as to believe that Crabtree's fears
were altogether without foundation: he forthwith
conjectured that Jack had taken umbrage
at an intimacy, from which he found himself
excluded, and imputed his disgrace to the insinuations
of Cadwallader, whom, in all likelihood,
he intended to punish for his supposed advice. 
He knew his friend could sustain no great damage
from the lieutenant's resentment, in a place which
he could immediately alarm with his cries, and
therefore wished he might fall into the snare, because
it would furnish him with a pretence of
complaint; in consequence of which, the sailors
would be obliged to shift their quarters, so as that
he should be rid of their company, in which he
at present could find no enjoyment. 
Every thing happened as he had foreseen; the
misanthrope, in his retreat from Peregrine's
chamber, was assaulted by Hatchway and his associate,
who seized him by the collar without
ceremony, and began to drag him towards the
pump, at which they would have certainly complimented
him with a very disagreeable bath, had
not he exalted his voice in such a manner, as in
a moment brought a number of the inhabitants,
and Pickle himself to his aid. The assailants
would have persisted in their design, had the opposition 

been such, as they could have faced with
any possibility of success; nor did they quit their
prey, before a dozen, at least, had come to his
rescue, and Peregrine, with a menacing aspect
and air of authority, commanded his old valet to
withdraw: then they thought proper to sheer off,
and betake themselves to close quarters, while
our hero accompanied the affrighted Cadwallader
to the gate, and exhibited to the warden a formal
complaint against the rioters, upon whom he retorted
the charge of lunacy, which was supported
by the evidence of twenty persons, who had been
eye-witnesses of the outrage committed against
the old gentleman. 
The governor, in consequence of this information,
sent a message to Mr. Hatchway, warning
him to move his lodging next day, on pain
of being expelled; and the lieutenant contumaciously
refusing to comply with this intimation,
was in the morning, while he amused himself in
walking upon the bear, suddenly surrounded by
the constables of the court, who took him and
his adherent prisoners, before they were aware,
and delivered them into the hands of the turn-keys,
by whom they were immediately dismissed,
and their baggage conveyed to the side of the
ditch. 
This expulsion was not performed without an
obstinate opposition on the part of the delinquents,
who, had they not been surprized, would
have set the whole Fleet at defiance, and, in all
probability, acted divers tragedies, before they
could have been over-powered. Things being
circumstanced as they were, the lieutenant did
not part with his conductor, without tweaking
his nose, by way of farewel; and Pipes, in imitation 

of such a laudable example, communicated
a token of remembrance, in an application to the
sole eye of his attendant, who, scorning to be
out-done in this kind of courtesy, returned the
compliment with such good will, that Tom's organ
performed the office of a multiplying glass. 
These were mutual hints for stripping; and accordingly,
each was naked from the waist upwards
in a trice. A ring of butchers from the
market was immediately formed; a couple of the
reverend Flamens, who, in morning-gowns, ply
for marriages in that quarter of the town, constituted
themselves seconds and umpires of the
approaching contest, and the battle began without
further preparation. The combatants were,
in point of strength and agility, pretty equally
matched; but the jailor had been regularly trained
to the art of bruising: he had more than once
signalized himself in public, for his prowess and
skill in this exercise, and lost one eye upon the
stage, in the course of his exploits. This was a
misfortune of which Pipes did not fail to take the
advantage: he had already sustained several hard
knocks upon his temples and jaws and found it
impracticable to smite his antagonist upon the
victualling-office, so dexterously was it defended
against assault: upon which he changed his battery,
and being ambi-dexter, raised such a clatter
upon the turnkey's blind side, that this hero, believing
him left-handed, converted his attention
that way, and opposed the unenlightened side of
his face to the right-hand of Pipes, which being
thus unprovided against, slily bestowed upon him
a peg under the fifth rib, that in an instant laid
him senseless on the pavement, at the feet of his
conqueror, who was congratulated upon his victory, 

not only by his friend Hatchway, but also
by all the by-standers, particularly the priest who
had espoused his cause, and now invited the
strangers to his lodging in a neighbouring alehouse,
where they were entertained so much to
their liking, that they determined to seek no
other habitation while they should continue in
town: and notwithstanding the disgrace and discouragement
they had met with, in their endeavours
to serve our adventurer, they were still resolved
to persevere in their good offices, or, in
the vulgar phrase, to see him out. 
While they settled themselves in this manner,
and acquired familiar connexions round all the
purlieus of the ditch, Peregrine found himself
deprived of the company of Cadwallader, who
signified by letter, that he did not chuse to hazard
his person again in visiting him, while such
assassins occupied the avenues through which he
must pass; for he had been at pains to inquire
into the motions of the seamen, and informed
himself exactly of the harbour in which they
were moored. 
Our hero had been so much accustomed to the
conversation of Crabtree, which was altogether
suitable to the singularity of his own disposition,
that he could very ill afford to be debarred of it
at this juncture, when almost every other source
of enjoyment was stopped. He was, however,
obliged to submit to the hardships of his situation; 
and as the characters of his fellow-prisoners
did not at all improve upon him, he was
compelled to seek for satisfaction within himself. 
Not but that he had an opportunity of conversing
with some people, who neither wanted sense, nor
were deficient in point of principle; yet there 

appeared in the behaviour of them all, without
exception, a certain want of decorum, a squalor
of sentiment, a sort of jailish cast contracted in
the course of confinement, which disgusted the
delicacy of our hero's observation. He, therefore,
detached himself from their parties as much as he
could, without giving offence to those among
whom he was obliged to live, and resumed his
labours with incredible eagerness and perseverance,
his spirits being supported by the success
of some severe Philippics, which he occasionally
published against the author of his misfortune. 
Nor was his humanity unemployed in the vacations
of his revenge: a man must be void of all
sympathy and compassion, who can reside among
so many miserable objects, without feeling an inclination
to relieve their distress. Every day almost
presented to his view such lamentable scenes, as
were most likely to attract his notice, and engage
his benevolence. Reverses of fortune, attended
with the most deplorable circumstances of
domestic woe, were continually intruding upon
his acquaintance; his ears were invaded with the
cries of the hapless wife, who from the enjoyment
of affluence and pleasure, was forced to
follow her husband to this abode of wretchedness
and want; his eyes were every minute assailed
with the naked and meagre appearances of hunger
and cold; and his fancy teemed with a thousand
aggravations of their misery. 
Thus situated, his purse was never shut, while
his heart remained open. Without reflecting upon
the slenderness of his store, he exercised his
charity to all the children of distress, and acquired
a popularity which, though pleasing, was far
from being profitable. In short, his bounty kept 

no pace with his circumstances, and in a little
time he was utterly exhausted. He had recourse
to his bookseller, from whom, with great difficulty,
be obtained a small reinforcement; and
immediately relapsed into the same want of retention. 
He was conscious of his infirmity, and
found it incurable: he foresaw, that by his own
industry he should never be able to defray the
expence of these occasions; and this reflection
sunk deep into his mind: the approbation of the
public, which he had earned or might acquire,
like a cordial often repeated, began to lose its
effect upon his imagination; his health suffered
by his sedentary life and austere application; his
eye-sight failed, his appetite forsook him, his spirits
decayed; so that he became melancholy, listless,
and altogether incapable of prosecuting the
only means he had left for his subsistence; and
(what did not at all contribute to the alleviation
of these particulars) he was given to understand
by his lawyer, that he had lost his cause, and
was condemned in costs. Even this was not
the most mortifying piece of intelligence he received; 
he at the same time learn'd, that his
bookseller was bankrupt, and his friend Crabtree
at the point of death. 
These were comfortable considerations to a
youth of Peregrine's disposition, which was so
capricious, that the more his misery increased,
the more haughty and inflexible he became. 
Rather than be beholden to Hatchway, who still
hovered about the gate, eager for an opportunity
to assist him, he chose to undergo the want of
almost every convenience of life, and actually
pledged his wearing-apparel to an Irish pawn-broker
in the Fleet, for money to purchase those 

things, without which he must have absolutely
perished. He was gradually irritated by his misfortunes
into a rancorous resentment against mankind
in general, and his heart so alienated from
the enjoyments of life, that he did not care how
soon he quitted his miserable existence. Though
he had shocking examples of the vicissitudes of
fortune continually before his eyes, he could never
be reconciled to the idea of living like his
fellow-sufferers, in the most abject degree of dependance. 
If he refused to accept of favours
from his own allies and intimate friends, whom
he had formerly obliged, it is not to be supposed
that he would listen to proposals of that kind
from any of his fellow-prisoners, with whom he
had contracted acquaintance: he was even more
cautious than ever of incurring obligations; he
now shunned his former mess-mates, in order to
avoid disagreeable tenders of friendship; and imagining
that he perceived an inclination in the
clergyman, to learn the state of his finances, he
discouraged and declined the explanation, and
at length secluded himself from all society.
