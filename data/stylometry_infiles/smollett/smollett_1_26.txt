He bears his fate like a philosopher; and contracts
acquaintance with a very remarkable
personage. 
This was a proper subject for our hero to
moralize upon; and accordingly, it did
not pass without his remarks; he found himself
fairly foiled at his own weapons, reduced
to indigence in a foreign land, and, what he
chiefly regretted, robbed of all those gay expectations 

he had indulged from his own supposed
excellence in the wiles of fraud; for, upon
a little recollection he plainly perceived he
had fallen a sacrifice to the confederacy he had
refused to join; and did not at all doubt, that
the dice were loaded for his destruction: but
instead of beating his head against the wall,
tearing his hair, imprecating vain curses upon
himself, or betraying other frantic symptoms
of despair, he resolved to accommodate himself
to his fate, and profit by the lesson he had so
dearly bought. 
With this intention, he immediately dismissed
his valet, quitted his lodgings, retired to an obscure
street on the other side of the river, and
covering one eye with a large patch of black
silk, presented himself in quality of a musician,
to the director of the opera, who, upon hearing
a trial of his skill, received him into the band,
without further question. While he continued
in this situation, he not only improved his taste
and execution in musick, but likewise found
frequent opportunities to extend his knowledge
of mankind; for, besides the employment he
exercised in public, he was often concerned in
private concerts that were given in the hotels of
noblemen; by which means, he became more
and more acquainted with the persons, manners
and characters of high life, which he contemplated
with the most industrious attention, as a
spectator, who being altogether unconcerned
in the performance, is at more liberty to observe
and enjoy the particulars of the entertainment. 
It was in one of those assemblies, he had the
pleasure of seeing his friend Sir Stentor, dressed 

in the most fashionable manner, and behaving
with all the overstrained politesse of a native
Frenchman: he was accompanied by his
brother knight and the abbe, and this triumvirate,
even in Fathom's hearing, gave a most
ludicrous detail of the finesse they had practised
upon the Polish count, to their entertainer,
who was ambassador from a certain court, and
made himself extremely merry with the particulars
of the relation. Indeed, they made shift
to describe some of the circumstances in such a
ridiculous light, that our adventurer himself,
smarting as he was with the disgrace, could
not help laughing in secret at the account. 
He afterwards made it his business to enquire
into the characters of the two British knights,
and understood they were notorious sharpers,
who had come abroad for the good of their
country, and now hunted in couple among a
French pack, that dispersed themselves through
the public ordinaries, walks, and spectacles, in
order to make a prey of incautious strangers. 
The pride of Ferdinand was piqued at this
information; and he was even animated with
the desire of making reprisals upon this fraternity,
from which he ardently longed to retrieve
his honour and effects; but the issue of his
last adventure had reinforced his caution; and
for the present, he found means to suppress
the dictates of his avarice and ambition; resolving
to employ his whole penetration in reconnoitring
the ground, before he should venture
to take the field again. He therefore
continued to act the part of a one-eyed fidler,
under the name of Fadini, and lived with incredible
frugality, that he might save a purse 

for his future operations. In this manner had
he proceeded for the space of ten months, during
which he acquired a competent knowledge
of the city of Paris, when his curiosity
was attracted by certain peculiarities in the appearance
of a man, who lived in one of the upper
apartments belonging to the house, in
which he himself had fixed his habitation. 
This was a tall, thin, meagre figure, with a
long black beard, an aquiline nose, a brown
complexion, and a most piercing vivacity in his
eyes: he seemed to be about the age of fifty,
wore the Persian habit, and there was a remarkable
severity in his aspect and demeanour. 
He and our adventurer had been fellow lodgers
for some time, and, according to the laudable
custom of these days, had hitherto remained
as much estranged to one another, as if they
had lived on opposite sides of the globe; but of
late, the Persian seemed to regard our hero
with particular attention; when they chanced
to meet on the stair-case, or elsewhere, he bowed
to Ferdinand with great solemnity, and complimented
him with the Pas: he even proceeded
in the course of this communication, to open
his mouth, and salute him with a good
morrow, and sometimes made the common remarks
upon the weather. Fathom, who was
naturally complaisant, did not discourage these
advances: on the contrary, he behaved to him
with marks of particular respect, and one day,
desired the favour of his company to breakfast. 
This invitation the stranger declined with
due acknowledgement, on pretence of being
out of order; and in the mean time, our adventurer
bethought himself of questioning the 

landlord concerning his outlandish guest. His
curiosity was rather inflamed than satisfied
with the information he could obtain from
this quarter; for, all he learned, was, that the
Persian went by the name of Ali Beker, and
that he had lived in the house, for the space of
four months, in a most solitary and parsimonious
manner, without being visited by one
living soul; that, for some time after his arrival,
he had been often heard to groan dismally
in the night, and even to exclaim in an
unknown language, as if he had laboured under
some grievous affliction; and though the
first transports of his grief had subsided, it was
easy to perceive, he still indulged a deep rooted
melancholy, for the tears were frequently
observed to trickle down his beard. The commissaire
of the quarter had at first ordered
this Oriental to be watched in his out-goings,
according to the maxims of the French police; 
but his life was found so regular and inoffensive,
that this precaution was soon set aside. 
Any man of humane sentiments, from the
knowledge of these particulars, would have
been prompted to offer his services to the forlorn
stranger: but as our hero was devoid of
all these infirmities of human nature, it was
necessary that other motives should produce
the same effect: his curiosity, therefore, joined
with the hopes of converting the confidence
of Ali to his own emolument, effectually impelled
him towards his acquaintance; and in a little
time, they began to relish the conversation of
each other: for, as the reader may have already
observed, Fathom possessed all the arts
of insinuation; and had discernment, enough 

to perceive an air of dignity in the Persian,
which the humility of his circumstances
could not conceal. He was, moreover, a man
of good understanding, not without a tincture
of letters, perfectly well-bred, though in a ceremonious
stile, extremely moral in his discourse,
and scrupulously nice in his notions of
honour. 
Our hero conformed himself in all respects,
to the other's opinions, and managed his discretion
so as to pass upon him, for a gentleman
reduced by misfortunes, to the exercise of an
employment which was altogether unsuitable
to his birth and quality. He made earnest and
repeated tenders of his good offices to the
stranger, and pressed him to make use of his
purse, with such cordial perseverance, that at
length Ali's reserve was overcome, and he
condescended to borrow of him a small sum,
which, in all probability, saved his life; for he
had been driven to the utmost extremity of
want, before he would accept of this assistance. 
Fathom, having gradually stole into his
good graces, began to take notice of many piteous
sighs that escaped him, in the moments
of their intercourse, and seemed to denote an
heart fraught with woe; and on pretence of
administring consolation and counsel, begged
leave to know the cause of his distress; observing
that his mind would be disburthened by
such communication, and perhaps his grief alleviated
by some means which they might
jointly concert, and execute in his behalf. 
Ali, thus sollicited, would often shake his
head with marks of extreme sorrow and despondence,
and while the tears gushed from 

his eyes, declared that his distress was beyond
the power of any remedy but death, and that
by making our hero his confident, he should
only extend his unhappiness to a friend, without
feeling the least remission of his own torture. 
Notwithstanding those repeated declarations,
Ferdinand, who was well enough acquainted
with the mind of man, to know that
such importunity is seldom or never disagreeable,
redoubled his instances, together with
his expressions of sympathy and esteem, until
the stranger was prevailed upon to gratify his
curiosity and benevolence. Having therefore
secured the chamber-door, one night, while
all the rest of the family was asleep, the unfortunate
Hali disclosed himself in these words.
