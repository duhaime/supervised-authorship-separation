By the fidelity of Pipes, Jolter is informed of his
pupil's fate. Confers with the physician. Applies
to the Embassador, who with great difficulty obtains
the discharge of the prisoners, on certain conditions. 
This plan he executed notwithstanding the
pain of his wound, and the questions of
the city guard both horse and foot, to which he
could make no other answer than “Anglois, Anglois;” 
and as soon as it was light, taking an accurate
survey of the castle (for such it seemed to 

be) into which Peregrine and Pallet had been conveyed,
together with its situation in respect to the
river, he went home to the lodgings, and waking
Mr. Jolter, gave him an account of the adventure. 
The governor wrung his hands in the utmost
grief and consternation, when he heard this
unfortunate piece of news; he did not doubt that
his pupil was imprisoned in the Bastile for life; 
and in the anguish of his apprehension, cursed the
day on which he had undertaken to superintend
the conduct of such an imprudent young man,
who had by reiterated insults provoked the vengeance
of such a mild forbearing administration. 
That he might not, however, neglect any means
in his power to extricate him from his present misfortune,
he dispatched Thomas to the doctor,
with an account of his companion's fate, that
they might join their interest in behalf of the
captives; and the physician being informed of
what had happened, immediately dressed himself
and repaired to Jolter, whom he accosted in these
words: “Now, sir, I hope you are convinced
of your error, in asserting that oppression can never
be the effect of arbitrary power. Such a calamity
as this could never have happened under
the Athenian democracy: nay, even when the
tyrant Pisistratus got possession of that commonwealth,
he durst not venture to rule with such
absolute and unjust dominion. You shall see now
that Mr. Pickle and my friend Pallet will fall a
sacrifice to the tyrancy of lawless power; and in
my opinion, we shall be accessory to the ruin of
this poor enslaved people, if we bestir ourselves
in demanding, or imploring the release of our unhappy
countrymen; as we may thereby prevent
the commission of a flagrant crime, which would 

fill up the vengeance of heaven against the perpetrators,
and perhaps be the means of restoring a
whole nation to the unspeakable fruition of freedom. 
For my own part, I should rejoice to see
the blood of my father spilt in such a glorious
cause, provided such a victim would furnish me
with the opportunity of dissolving the chains of
slavery, and vindicating that liberty which is the
birth-right of man. Then would my name be
immortalized among the patriot heroes of antiquity,
and my memory like that of Harmodius
and Aristogiton, be honoured by statues erected
at the public expense.” This rhapsody, which
was delivered with great emphasis and agitation,
gave so much offence to Jolter, that without
speaking one word, he retired in great wrath to 
his own chamber, and the republican returned to
his lodging, in full hope of his prognostic being
verified in the death and destruction of Peregrine
and the painter, which must give rise to some renowned
revolution, wherein he himself would act
a principal part. But the governor, whose imagination
was not quite so warm and prolifick, went
directly to the Embassador, whom he informed of
his pupil's situation, and besought to interpose
with the French ministry, that he and the other
British subject might obtain their liberty. 
His excellency asked if Jolter could guess at the
cause of his imprisonment, that he might be the
better prepared to vindicate or excuse his conduct; 
but neither he nor Pipes could give the smallest
hint of intelligence on that subject; though he
furnished himself from Tom's own mouth with a
circumstantial account of the manner in which
his master had been arrested, as well as of his own
behaviour, and the disaster he had received on that 

occasion. His Lordship never doubted that Pickle
had brought this calamity upon himself by some
unlucky prank he had played at the masquerade; 
especially when he understood that the young
gentleman had drank freely in the afternoon, and
been so whimsical as to go thither with a man in
woman's apparel; and he that same day waited on
the French minister, in full confidence of obtaining
his discharge; but met with more difficulty
than he expected, the court of France being extremely
punctilious in every thing that concerns
a prince of the blood: the ambassador was, therefore,
obliged to talk in very high terms, and
though the present circumstances of the French
politicks would not allow them to fall out with
the British administration for trifles, all the favour
he could procure, was a promise that Pickle
should be set at liberty, provided he would ask
pardon of the prince to whom he had given offence. 
His excellency thought this was but a reasonable
condescension, supposing Peregrine to have been
in the wrong; and Jolter was admitted to him,
in order to communicate and reinforce his Lordship's
advice, which was that he should comply
with the terms proposed. The governor, who did
not enter this gloomy fortress without fear and
trembling, found his pupil in a dismal apartment
void of all furniture, but a stool and truckle-bed; 
the moment he was admitted, he perceived the
youth whistling with great unconcern, and working
with his pencil at the bare wall, on which he
had delineated a ludicrous figure labelled with the
name of the nobleman whom he had affronted,
and an English mastiff with his leg lifted up, in
the attitude of making water in his shoe. He had
been even so presumptuous as to explain the device 

with satirical inscriptions in the French language,
which when Jolter perused, his hair stood
on end with affright. The very turnkey was
confounded and overawed by the boldness of his
behaviour, which he had never seen matched by
any inhabitant of that place; and actually joined
his friend in persuading him to submit to the easy
demand of the minister. But our hero, far from
embracing the counsel of this advocate, handed
him to the door with great ceremony, and dismissed
him with a kick on the breech; and to all
the supplications, and even tears of Jolter, made
no other reply, than that he would stoop to no
condescension, because he had committed no
crime; but would leave his case to the cognizance
and exertion of the British court, whose duty it
was to see justice done to its own subjects: he
desired, however, that Pallet, who was confined
in another place, might avail himself of his own
disposition, which was sufficiently plyable. But
when the governor desired to see his fellow-prisoner,
the turnkey gave him to understand that he
had received no orders relating to the lady, and
therefore could not admit him into her apartment; 
though he was complaisant enough to tell
him, that she seemed very much mortified at her
confinement, and at certain times behaved as if
her brain was not a little disordered. Jolter thus
baffled in all his endeavours, quitted the Bastile
with a heavy heart, and reported his fruitless negociation
to the Embassador, who could not help
breaking forth into some acrimonious expressions
against the obstinacy and insolence of the young
man, who, he said, deserved to suffer for his
folly. Nevertheless, he did not desist from his
representations to the French ministry, which he 

found so unyielding, that he was obliged to
threaten in plain terms, to make it a national concern; 
and not only write to his court for instructions,
but even advise the council to make reprisals,
and send some French gentleman in London
to the Tower. 
This intimation had an effect upon the ministry
at Versailles, who rather than run the risk of
incensing a people whom it was neither their interest
nor inclination to disoblige, consented to
discharge the offenders, on condition that they
should leave Paris in three days after their enlargement. 
This proposal was readily agreed to by
Peregrine, who was now a little more tractable,
and heartily tired of being cooped up in such an
uncomfortable abode, for the space of three long
days, without any sort of communication or entertainment,
but that which his own imagination
suggested.
