He makes some progress in her affections; is interrupted
by a dispute between Jolter and a Jew; 
appeases the wrath of the Capuchin, who procures
for him an interview with his fair enslaver,
in which he finds himself deceived. 
Peregrine, mean while, employed all his insinuation
and address in practising upon the
heart of the Capuchin's fair charge. He had long
ago declared his passion, not in the superficial
manner of a French gallant, but with all the
ardor of an enthusiast. He had languished, vow'd,
flattered, kiss'd her hand by stealth, and had no
reason to complain of his reception. Though
by a man of a less sanguine disposition, her particular
complaisance would have been deemed
equivocal, and perhaps nothing more than the effect
of French breeding and constitutional vivacity; 
he gave his own qualifications credit for
the whole, and with these sentiments carried on
the attack with such unabating vigour, that she
was actually prevailed upon to accept a ring,
which he presented as a token of his esteem; and
every thing proceeded in a most prosperous train,
when they were disturbed by the governor and 

Israelite, who in the heat of disputation raised
their voices, and poured forth such effusions of
gutturals, as set our lover's teeth on edge. As
they spoke in a language unknown to every one
in the carriage but themselves, and looked at
each other with mutual animosity and rancour,
Peregrine desired to know the cause of their contention. 
Upon which, Jolter exclaimed in a furious
tone, “This learned Levite, forsooth, has
the impudence to tell me, that I don't understand
Hebrew; and affirms, that the word Benoni signifies
child of joy; whereas I can prove, and indeed
have already said enough to convince any
reasonable man, that in the Septuagint it is rightly
translated into son of my sorrow. Having thus
explained himself to his pupil, he turned to the
priest, with intention to appeal to his determination; 
but the Jew pulled him by the sleeve with
great eagerness, saying, “For the love of God
be quiet, the Capuchin will discover who we are!” 
Jolter, offended at this conjunction, ecchoed
“Who we are!” with great emphasis; and repeating
nos poma natamus, asked ironically, to
which of the Tribes the Jew thought he belonged? 
The Levite, affronted at his comparing him to a
ball of horse-dung, replied with a most significant
grin, “To the tribe of Issachar.” And
his antagonist, taking the advantage of his unwillingness
to be known by the friar, and prompted
by revenge for the freedom he had used, answered
in the French language, that the judgment
of God was still manifest upon their whole
race, not only in their being in the state of exiles
from their native land, but also in the spite of
their hearts and pravity of their dispositions,
which demonstrate them to be the genuine offspring 

of those who crucified the Saviour of the
world. 
His expectation was, however, defeated; the
priest himself was too deeply engaged, to attend
to the debates of other people. The physician,
in the pride and insolence of his learning, had
undertaken to display the absurdity of the Christian
faith; having already (as he thought) confuted
the Capuchin, touching the points of belief
in which the Roman Catholics differ from the rest
of the world. But, not contented with the imagined
victory he had gained, he began to strike
at the fundamentals of religion; and the father,
with incredible forbearance, suffered him to make
very free with the doctrine of the Trinity: but,
when he levelled the shafts of his ridicule at the
immaculate conception of the Blessed Virgin, the
good man's patience forsook him, his eyes seemed
to kindle with indignation, he trembled in every
joint, and uttered with a loud voice, “You are
an abominable—I will not call thee heretic,
for thou art worse (if possible) than a Jew; you
deserve to be inclosed in a furnace seven times
heated, and I have a good mind to lodge an information
against you with the governor of
Ghent, that you may be apprehended and punished
as an impious blasphemer.” 
This menace operated like a charm upon all
present. The doctor was confounded, the governor
dismayed, the Levite's teeth chattered,
the painter was astonished at the general confusion,
the cause of which he could not comprehend; 
and Pickle himself, not a little alarmed,
was obliged to use all his interest and assiduity
in appeasing this son of the church, who at
length, in consideration of the friendship he professed 

for the young gentleman, consented to forgive
what had passed, but absolutely refused to sit
in contact with such a profane wretch, whom he
looked upon as a fiend of darkness, sent by the
enemy of mankind to poison the minds of weak
people; so that, after having crossed himself,
and muttered certain exorcisms, he insisted upon
the doctor's changing places with the Jew, who
approached the offended ecclesiastic in an agony
of fear. 
Matters being thus compromised, the conversation
flowed in a more general channel; and
without the intervention of any other accident,
or bone of contention, the carriage arrived at the
city of Ghent about seven in the evening; and
supper being bespoke for the whole company, our
adventurer and his friends went out to take a superficial
view of the place, leaving his new mistress
to the pious exhortations of her confessor,
whom (as we have already observed) he had secured
in his interest. This zealous mediator
spoke so warmly in his commendation, and interested
her conscience so much in the affair, that
she could not refuse her helping hand to the great
work of his conversion, and promised to grant
the interview he desired. 
This agreeable piece of intelligence, which
the Capuchin communicated to Peregrine at his
return, elevated his spirits to such a degree, that
he shone at supper with uncommon brilliance, in
a thousand sallies of wit and pleasantry, to the
admiration and delight of all present, especially
of his fair Fleming, who seemed quite captivated
by his person and behaviour. 
The evening being thus spent to the satisfaction
of all parties, the company broke up, and 

retired to their several apartments, when our lover,
to his unspeakable mortification, learnt that the
two ladies were obliged to lie in the same room,
all the other chambers of the inn being preoccupied. 
When he imparted this difficulty to the priest,
that charitable father, who was very fruitful in
expedients, assured him, that his spiritual concerns
should not be obstructed by such a slender
impediment; and accordingly availed himself of
his prerogative, by going into his daughter's
chamber when she was almost undressed, and
leading her into his own, on pretence of administring
salutary food for her soul. Having
brought the two votaries together, he prayed for
success to the operations of grace, and left them
to their mutual meditations, after having conjured
them in the most solemn manner to let no impure
sentiments, or temptations of the flesh, interfere
with the hallowed design of their meeting. 
The reverend intercessor being gone, and the
door fastened on the inside, the pseudo-convert,
transported with his passion, threw himself at his
Amanda's feet; and begging she would spare him
the tedious form of addresses, which the nature
of their interview would not permit him to observe,
began with all the impetuosity of love to
profit by the occasion. But, whether she was
displeased at the intrepidity and assurance of his
behaviour, thinking herself intitled to more courtship
and respect, or was really better fortified
with chastity than he or his procurer had supposed
her to be; certain it is, she expressed resentment
and surprize at his boldness and presumption,
and upbraided him with having imposed
upon the charity of the friar. The young
gentleman was really as much astonished at this 

rebuff, as she pretended to be at his declaration,
and earnestly intreated her to consider how precious
the moments were, and for once sacrifice
superfluous ceremony, to the happiness of one
who adored her with such a flame, as could not
fail to consume his vitals, if she would not deign
to bless him with her favour. Yet, notwithstanding
all his tears, vows and supplications, his personal
accomplishments and the tempting opportunity,
all that he could obtain, was an acknowledgment
of his having made an impression upon
her heart, which she hoped the dictates of her
duty would enable her to erase. This confession
he considered as a delicate consent; and obeying
the impulse of his love, snatched her up in his
arms, with intention of seizing that which she
declined to give; when this French Lucretia,
unable to defend her virtue any other way,
screamed aloud; and the Capuchin, setting his
shoulder to the door, burst it open, and entered
in an affected extasy of amazement. He lifted
up his hands and eyes, and pretended to be thunderstruck
at the discovery he had made; then, in
broken exclamations, professed his horror at the
wicked intention of our hero, who had covered
such a damnable scheme with the mask of religion. 
In short, he performed his cue with such dexterity,
that the lady believing him in earnest,
begg'd he would forgive the stranger, on account
of his youth and education, which had been tainted
by the errors of heresy; and he was on these
considerations content to accept the submission of
our hero, who, far from renouncing his expectations,
notwithstanding this mortifying repulse,
confided so much in his own talents, and the confession
which his mistress had made, that he resolved 

to make another effort, to which nothing
could have prompted him but the utmost turbulence
of unruly desire.
