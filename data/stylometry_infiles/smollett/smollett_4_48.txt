The gascon does not use his victory with all the
moderation that might have been expected
—In order to be revenged I learn the
science of defence.—we join Marechal
Duc de Noailles—are engaged with the
allies at Dettingen, and put to flight— 
the behaviour of the French soldiers on
that occasion—I industriously seek another
combat with the old gascon, and vanquish
him in my turn—our regiment is put
into winter quarters at Rheims, where I
find my friend Strap—our recognition— 
he supplies me with money, and procures my
discharge—we take a trip to Paris; 
from whence we set out for London by
the way of Flanders, where we safely arrive. 
He was disconcerted at this declaration,
to which he made no reply, but repaired
to the dancers, among whom he recounted his
victory with many exaggerations and gasconades; 
while I, taking up my sword, went to my quarters
and examined my wound, which I found was
of no consequence. —The same day, an Irish
drummer, having heard my misfortune, visited
me, and after having condoled me on the chance
of war, gave me to understand, that he was 

master of his sword, and would in a very short
time instruct me so thoroughly in that noble
science, that I should be able to chastise the old
gascon for his insolent boasting at my expence. 
—This friendly office he proffered on pretence
of the regard he had for his countrymen; but I
afterwards learned the true motive was no other
than a jealousy be entertained of a correspondence
between the Frenchman and his wife, which he
did not think proper to resent in person. —Be
this as it will, I accepted his offer, and practised
his lessons with such application, that I soon believed
myself a match for my conqueror. —In the
mean time we continued our march, and arrived
at the camp of Mareschal Noailles, the night
before the battle of Dettingen. Notwithstanding
the fatigue we had undergone, our regiment was
one of those that were ordered next day to cross
the river, under the command of the Duc de
Gramont, to take possession of a narrow defile,
through which the allies must of necessity have
passed at a great disadvantage, or remain where
they were, and perish for want of provision, if
they would not condescend to surrender at discretion. 
—How they suffered themselves to be pent
up in this manner, it is not my province to relate; 
I shall only observe, that when we had taken
possession of our ground, I heard an old officer
in conversation with another, profess a surprise
at the conduct of Lord Stair, who had the reputation
of a good general. —But it seems, at this
time, that nobleman was over-ruled, and only
acted in an inferior character; so that no part of
the blame could be imputed to him, who declared
his disapprobation of the step, in consequence of
which the whole army was in the utmost danger; 

but providence or destiny acted miracles in
their behalf, by disposing the Duc de Gramont
to quit his advantageous post, pass the defile, and
attack the English, who were drawn up in order
of battle on the plain, and who handled us so
roughly, that after having lost a great number of
men, we turned our backs without ceremony,
and fled with such precipitation, that many hundreds
perished in the river, through pure fear and
confusion; for the enemy was so generous, that
they did not pursue us one inch of ground; 
and if our consternation would have permitted,
we might have retreated with great order and deliberation. 
—But not withstanding the royal clemency
of the king of Great Britain, who headed
the allies in person, and no doubt, put a stop to the
carnage, our loss amounted to 5000 men, among
whom were many officers of distinction. —Our
miscarriage opened a passage for the foe to Hanau,
whither they immediately marched, leaving their
sick and wounded to the care of the French, who
next day took possession of the field of battle,
buried the dead, and treated the living with humanity. 
—This was a great consolation to us,
who thence took occasion to claim the victory; 
and the genius of the French nation never appeared
more conspicuous than now, in the rhodomontades
they uttered on the subject of their generosity
and courage: Every man, (by his own account)
performed seats that would have shamed
all the heroes of antiquity. —One compared himself
to a lion retiring at leisure from his cowardly
pursuers, who keep at a wary distance, and
gall him with their darts. —Another likened himself
to a bear that retreats with his face to the 

enemy, who dare not assail him; and a third assumed
the character of a desperate stag, that turns
upon the hounds and keeps them at bay. — 
There was not a private soldier engaged, who
had not by the prowess of his single arm, demolished
a whole platoon, or put a squadron of
horse to flight; and among others, the meagte
gascon extoled his exploits above those of Hercules
or Charlemagne. —As I still retained my
resentment for the disgrace I suffered in my last
recontre with him, and now that I thought myself
qualified, longed for an opportunity to retrieve
my honour; I magnified the valour of the
English with all the hyperboles I could imagine,
and decried the pusilanimity of the French in the
same stile, comparing them to hares flying before
grey-hounds, or mice pursued by cats; and passed
an ironical compliment on the speed he exerted
in his flight, which, considering his age and infirmities,
I said was surprising. —He was stung to
the quick by this sarcasm, and with an air of
threatning disdain, bid me know myself better,
and remember the correction I had already received
from him for my insolence; for he might
not be always in the humour of sparing a wretch
who abused his goodness. To this inuendo I
made no reply but by a kick on the breech,
which overturned him in an instant. —He
started up with wonderful agility, and drawing
his sword, attacked me with great fury: Several
people interposed, but when he informed them
of its being an affair of honour, they retired and
left us to decide the battle by ourselves. I sustained
his onset with little damage, having only
received a small scratch on my right shoulder, 

and seeing his breath and vigour almost exhausted,
assaulted him in my turn, closed with him, and
wrested his sword out of his hand in the struggle. 
—Having thus acquired the victory, I desired
him to beg his life; to which he made no answer,
but shrugged up his shoulders to his ears, expanded
his hands, elevated the skin of his forehead
and eye-brows, and depressed the corners of
his mouth, in such a manner, that I could scarce
refrain from laughing aloud at his grotesque appearance. 
—That I might, however, mortify his
vanity, which had triumphed without bounds
over my misfortune, I thrust his sword up to the
hilt in something (it was not a tansy) that lay
smoaking on the plain, and joined the rest of the
soldiers with an air of tranquility and indifference. 
There was nothing more of moment attempted
by either of the armies during the remaining part
of the campaign, which being ended, the English
marched back to the Netherlands; part of our
army was detached to French Flanders, and our
regiment ordered to winter-quarters in Champagne. 
—It was the fate of the grenadier company,
to which I now belonged, to lie at Rheims, where
I found myself in the utmost want of every
thing: My pay, which amounted to five sols
a day, so far from supplying me with necessaries,
being scarce sufficient to procure a wretched subsistance,
to keep soul and body together; so
that I was by hunger and hard duty, brought
down to the meagre condition of my fellow-soldiers,
and my linen reduced from three tolerable
shirts, to two pair of sleeves and necks, the bodies
having been long ago converted into spatter-dashes; 
and after all, I was better provided than 

any private man in the regiment. —In this urgency
of my affairs, I wrote to my uncle in
England, though my hopes from that quarter
were not at all sanguine, for the reasons I have
already explained, and in the mean time had recourse
to my old remedy patience, consoling myself
with the flattering suggestions of a lively
imagination that never abandoned me in my
distress. 
One day, while I stood centinel at the gate
of a general officer, a certain nobleman came
to the door, followed by a gentleman in mourning,
to whom, at parting, I heard him say,
“You may depend upon my good offices.” — 
This assurance was answered by a low bow of
the person in black, who turning to go away,
discovered to me the individual countenance of
my old friend and adherent Strap. —I was so much
astonished at the sight, that I lost the power of
utterance, and before I could recollect myself,
he was gone, without taking any notice of me. — 
Indeed, had he staid, I scarce would have ventured
to accost him; because, though I was perfectly
well acquainted with the features of his
face, I could not be positively certain as to the
rest of his person, which was very much altered
for the better, since he left me at London; neither
could I conjecture by what means he was
enabled to appear in the sphere of a gentleman,
to which, while I knew him, he had not even the
ambition to aspire. —But I was too much concerned
in the affair to neglect further information, and
therefore took the first opportunity of asking
the porter if he knew the gentleman to whom
the Marquis spoke. The Swiss told me, his
name was Monsieur d'Estrapes, that he had been 

valet de chambre to an English gentleman lately
deceased, and that he was very much regarded
by the Marquis for his fidelity to his master, between
whom and that nobleman a very intimate
friendship had subsisted. —Nothing could be more
agreeable to me than this piece of intelligence,
which banished all doubt of its being my friend,
who had found means to frenchify his name as
well as his behaviour, since we parted. As soon
therefore, as I was relieved, I went to his lodging,
according to a direction given me by the
Swiss, and had the good fortune to find him at
home. That I might surprize him the more,
I concealed my name and business, and only desired
the servant of the house, to tell Monsieur
d'Estrapes, that I begged the honour of half an
hour's conversation with him. —He was confounded
and dismayed at this message, when he understood
it was sent by a soldier, though he was
conscious to himself of no crime; all that he
had heard of the Bastile appeared to his imagination
with aggravated horror, and it was not
before I had waited a considerable time, that he
had resolution enough to bid the servant shew me
up stairs. —When I entered his chamber, he returned
my bow with great civility, and endeavoured
with forced complaisance, to disguise his
fear, which appeared in the paleness of his face,
the wildness of his looks, and the shaking of his
limbs. —I was diverted at his consternation, which
redoubled, when I told him (in French) I had
business for his private ear, and demanded a particular
audience. —The valet being withdrawn,
I asked in the same language, if his name was
d'Estrapes, to which he answered, with a foultering
tongue, “The same, at your service.” — 

“Are you a Frenchman? (said I.)” —“I have
not the honour to be a Frenchman born (replied
he) but I have an infinite veneration
for the country.” —I then desired he would do
me the honour to look at me, which he no sooner
did, than struck with my appearance, he started
back and cried in English, “O Jesus!—sure it
can't! —No, 'tis impossible!” —I smiled at
his interjections, saying, “I suppose you are too
much of a gentleman to own your friend in
adversity.” —When he heard me pronounce
these words in our own language, he leaped upon
me in a transport of joy, hung about my neck,
kissed me from ear to ear, and blubbered like a
great school-boy who has been whipt. — 
Then observing my dress, he set up his throat,
crying, “O L&wblank;d! O L&wblank;d! that ever
I should live to see my dearest friend reduced
to the condition of a foot soldier in
the French service! Why did you consent to
my leaving you? —But I know the reason— 
you thought you had got more creditable
friends, and grew ashamed of my acquaintance. 
—Ah! Lord help us! though I was a little
short-sighted, I was not altogether blind;— 
And though, I did not complain, I was not
the less sensible of your unkindness, which was
indeed the only thing that induced me to ramble
abroad, the Lord knows whither; but I must
own it has been a lucky ramble to me, and so
I forgive you, and may God forgive you: 
—O L&wblank;d! O L&wblank;d! is it come to this?” 
—I was nettled at the charge, which, though
just, I could not help thinking unseasonable, and
told him with some tartness, that whether his
suspicions were well or ill-grounded, he might 

have chosen a more convenient opportunity of introducing
them: And that the question now was,
whether or no he found himself disposed to lend
me any assistance. —“Disposed! (replied he
with great emotion) I thought you had known
me so well, as to assure yourself, without asking,
that I, and all that belongs to me, are at
your command. —In the mean time, you shall
dine with me, and I will tell you something
that, perhaps, will not be displeasing unto
you.” —Then wringing my hand, he said,
“It makes my heart bleed to see you in that
garb!” —I thanked him for his invitation,
which, I observed, could not be unwelcome to a
person who had not eaten a comfortable meal
these seven months; but I had another request
to make, which I begged he would grant before
dinner, and that was the loan of a shirt: For although
my back had been many weeks a stranger
to any comfort of this kind, my skin was not
yet quite familiarized to the want of it. —He
stared in my face, with a woful countenance, at
this declaration, which he would scarce believe,
until I explained it, by unbuttoning my coat,
and disclosing my naked body; a circumstance
that shocked the tender-hearted Strap,
who, with tears in his eyes, run to a chest of
drawers, and taking out some linen, presented
to me a very fine ruffled holland shirt, and
cambrick neckcloth, assuring me, he had
three dozen of the same kind at my service. — 
I was ravished at this piece of good news, and
having accommodated myself in a moment, hugged
my benefactor for his generous offer, saying,
I was overjoyed to find him undebauched by
prosperity, which seldom fails of corrupting the
heart. He bespoke for dinner, some soup and 

boillé, a couple of pullets roasted, and a dish of
sparrowgrass, and in the interim entertained me
with biscuit and Burgundy; after which he entreated
me to gratify his longing desire of knowing
every circumstance of my fortune since his
departure from London. —This I complyed with,
beginning at the adventure of Gawky, and relating
every particular event in which I had
been concerned from that day to the present hour. 
During the recital, my friend was strongly affected,
according to the various situations described: 
He started with surprize, glowed with
indignation, gaped with curiosity, smiled with
pleasure, trembled with fear, and wept with sorrow,
as the vicissitudes of my life inspired these
different passions; and when my story was ended,
signified his amazement on the whole, by lifting
up his eyes and hands, and protesting, that tho'
I was a young man, I had suffered more than all
the blessed martyrs. 
After dinner, I desired, in my turn, to know
the particulars of his peregrination, and he satisfied
me in a few words, by giving me to understand
that he had lived a year at Paris with his
master, who, in that time, having acquired the
language, as well as the fashionable exercises, to
perfection, made a tour of France and Holland,
during which excursion, he was so unfortunate as
to meet with three of his own countrymen on
their travels, in whose company he committed
such excesses, that his constitution failed, and he
fell into a consumption; that by the advice of
physicians he went to Montpelier for the benefit
of good air, and recovered so well in six weeks,
that he returned to Rheims, seemingly in good
health, where he had not continued above a 

month, when he was seized with a looseness,
that carried him off in ten days, to the unspeakable
sorrow of all who knew him, and especially
of Strap, who had been very happy in his service,
and given such satisfaction, that his master on his
death-bed, recommended him to several persons
of distinction, for his diligence, sobriety, and affection,
and left him by will, his wearing apparel,
gold watch, sword, rings, ready money, and all
the moveables he had in France, to the value of
three hundred pounds, “which I now (said he)
in the sight of God and man, surrender to your
absolute disposal: Here are my keys, take them,
I beseech you, and God give you joy of the
possession.” —My brain was almost turned
with this sudden change of fortune, which I
could scarce believe real; however, I positively
refused this extravagant proffer of my friend, and
put him in mind of my being a soldier; at which
he started, crying, “Odso! that's true—we
must procure your discharge—I have some interest
with a nobleman who is able to do me
that favour.” —We consulted about this affair,
and it was determined, that Monsieur d'Estrapes,
should wait upon the Marquis in the morning,
and tell him he had by accident found his brother,
whom he had not seen for many years before, a
private soldier in the regiment of Picardie, and implore
that nobleman's interest for his discharge. — 
In the mean time, we enjoyed ourselves over a
bottle of good Burgundy, and spent the evening
in concerting schemes for our future conduct, in
case I should be so lucky as to get rid of the
army. —The business was to make ourselves easy
for life, by means of his legacy, a task very
difficult, and, in the usual methods of laying out 

money, altogether impracticable; so that after
much canvasing, we could come to no resolution
that night, but when we parted, recommended
the matter to the serious attention of each other. 
As for my own part, I puzzled my imagination
to no purpose; when I thought of turning merchant,
the smallness of our stock, and the risk of
seas, enemies and markets, deterred me from that
scheme. —If I should settle as a surgeon in my
own country, I would find the business already
overstocked; or if I pretended to set up in England,
must labour under want of friends and powerful
opposition, obstacles unsurmountable by the
most shining merit; neither would I succeed in
my endeavours to rise in the state, inasmuch as I
could neither flatter nor pimp for courtiers, nor
prostitute my pen in defence of a wicked and contemptible
administration. —Before I could form
one feasible project, I fell asleep, and my fancy
was blessed with the image of my dear Narcissa,
who seemed to smile upon my passion, and offer
her hand as a reward for all my toils. 
Early in the morning, I went to the lodgings
of my friend, whom I found exulting over his
happy invention; for I no sooner entered his
apartment, than he addressed me in these words,
with a smile of self-applause: “Well, Mr.
Random, a lucky thought may come into a
fool's head sometimes. —I have hit it—I'll
hold you a button my plan is better than
yours, for all your learning. —But you shall
have the preference in this as in all other
things; therefore proceed, and let us know
the effects of your meditation,—and then I will
impart my own simple excogitations.” — 
I told him, that not one thought occurred to me 

which deserved the least notice, and signified my
impatience to be acquainted with the fruits of his
reflection. —“As we have not (said he) money
sufficient to maintain us during a tedious expectation,
it is my opinion, that a bold push
must be made; and I see none so likely to
succeed as your appearing in the character
of a gentleman (which is your due) and making
your addresses to some lady of fortune
who can render you independant at once. — 
Nay, don't stare—I affirm that this scheme
is both prudent and honourable; for I would
not have you throw yourself away upon an
old, toothless, wheezing dame, whose breath
would stink you into a consumption in less
than three months; neither would I advise
you to assume the character of a wealthy
'Squire, as your common fortune-hunters do,
by which means many a poor lady is cheated
into matrimony, and instead of enjoying the
pomp and grandeur that was promised, sees
her dowry seized by her husband's rapacious
creditors, and herself reduced to misery and
despair. —No, I know you have a soul that
disdains such imposition; and are master of
qualifications both of mind and body, which
alone entitle you to a match, that will set you
above the world. —I have cloaths in my possession,
that a Duke need not be ashamed to
wear. —I believe they will fit you as they are
—if not, there are plenty of taylors in France. 
—Let us take a short trip to Paris, and provide
ourselves in all other necessaries, then
set out for England, where I intend to do myself
the honour of attending you in quality of
valet. —This will save you the expence of a 

servant, shaving and dressing; and I doubt not
but by the blessing of God, we shall bring
matters to a speedy and fortunate issue.” — 
Extravagant as this proposal was, I listened to it
with pleasure, because it flattered my vanity, and
indulged a ridiculous hope I began to entertain
of inspiring Narcissa with a mutual flame. 
After breakfast, Monsieur d'Estrapes went to
pay his devoirs to the Marquis, and was so successful
in his application, that I obtained a discharge
in a few days, upon which we set out for Paris. 
—Here I had time to reflect and congratulate
myself upon this sudden transition of fate, which
to bear with moderation, required some degree
of philosophy and self-denial. —This will be more
obvious, if I give a detail of the particulars, to
the quiet possession of which I was raised in an
instant, from the most abject misery and contempt. 
—My wardrobe consisted of five fashionable
coats full-mounted, two of which were plain,
one of cut velvet, one trimed with gold, and
another with silver-lace; two frocks, one of
white drab with large plate buttons, the other of
blue, with gold binding; one waistcoat of gold
brocard; one of blue sattin, embroidered with
silver; one of green silk, trimmed with broad
figured gold lace; one of black silk, with figures; 
one of white sattin; one of black cloth,
and one of scarlet; six pair of cloth breeches; 
one pair of crimson, and another of black velvet; 
twelve pair of white silk stockings, as many of
black silk, and the same number of fine cotton; 
one hat, laced with gold point d'Espagne, another
with silver-lace scolloped, a third with gold binding,
and a fourth plain; three dozen of fine
ruffled shirts, as many neckcloths; one dozen 

of cambrick handkerchiefs, and the like number
of silk. The other moveables which I possessed
by the generosity and friendship of Strap, were,
a gold watch with a chased case, two valuable
diamond rings, two mourning swords, one with
a silver handle, and a fourth cut steel inlaid with
gold; a diamond stock-buckle, and a set of stone
buckles for the knees and shoes; a pair of silver
mounted pistols with rich housings; a gold-headed
cane, and a snuff-box of tortoise-shell mounted
with gold, having the picture of a lady in the
lid. —The gentleman left many other things of
value, which my friend had converted into cash
before I met with him, so that over and above
these particulars, our stock in ready money amounted
to something more than two hundred
pounds. 
Thus equipt, I put on the gentleman of figure,
and attended by my honest friend, who was contented
with the station of my valet. I visited the
Louvre, examined the gallery of Luxemburgh,
and appeared at Versailles, where I had the honour
of seeing his Most Christian Majesty eat a
considerable quantity of olives. —During the
month I spent at Paris, I went several times to
court, the Italian opera, and play-house, danced
at a masquerade, and in short saw every thing
remarkable in and about that capital. —After
which we set out for England by the way of
Flanders, passed through Brussels, Ghent, and
Bruges, and took shipping at Ostend, from whence
in fourteen hours we arrived at Deal, hired a
post-chaise, and in twelve hours more got safe to
London; having disposed of our heavy baggage
in the waggon.
