I am arrested—carried to the Marshalsea— 
find my old acquaintance beau Jackson in
that jail—he informs me of his adventures
—Strap arrives, and with difficulty is comforted
—Jackson introduces me to a poet— 
I admire his conversation and capacity—am
deeply affected with my misfortune—Strap
hires himself as a journeyman-barber. 
But this expedient was in a few weeks attended
with a consequence I did not foresee:
a player having purchased one of the suits which
were exposed to sale, appeared in it on the stage
one night, while my taylor unfortunately happened
to be present. —He knew it immediately, and
enquiring minutely into the affair, discovered my
whole contrivance: upon which he came to my
lodgings, and telling me that he was very much
straitened for want of money, presented his bill,
which amounted to 50l. —Surprized at this unexpected
address, I affected to treat him cavalierly,
swore some oaths, asked if he doubted my
honour, and, telling him I should take care who
I dealt with for the future, bid him come again
in three days. —He obeyed me punctually, demanded
his money, and finding himself amused
with bare promises, arrested me that very day in
the street. —I was not much shocked at this adventure,
which, indeed, rescued me from a horrible 

suspence in which I had lived since his first
visit. I refused to go to a spunging-house, where
I had heard there was nothing but the most flagrant
imposition; and a coach being called, I was
carried to the Marshalsea, attended by a bailiff and
his follower, who were very much disappointed
and chagrined at my resolution. 
The turnkey guessing, from my appearance,
that I had got money in my pocket, received
me with the repetition of the Latin word depone,
and gave me to understand, that I must pay before-hand
for the apartment I should chuse to
dwell in. —I desired to see his conveniencies,
and hired a small, paultry bed-chamber, for a
crown a week, which, in any other place, would
not have let at eighteen-pence. —Having taken
possession of this dismal habitation, I sent for
Strap, and my thoughts were busied in collecting
matter of consolation to that faithful squire, when
somebody knocked at my door, which I no
sooner opened, than a young fellow entered, in
very shabby cloaths and marvellous foul linnen. 
After a low bow, he called me by my name,
and asked if I had forgot him. His voice assisted
me in recollecting this person, whom I soon recognized
to be my old acquaintance beau Jackson,
of whom mention is made in the first part of
my memoirs. —I saluted him, expressed my satisfaction
at finding him alive, and condoled
with him on his present situation; which, however,
did not seem to affect him much, for he
laughed very heartily at the occasion of our meeting
so unexpectedly in this place. After our
mutual compliments were over, I enquired about
his amour with the lady of fortune, which seem'd
to be so near an happy conclusion when I had the 

pleasure of seeing him last: and after an immoderate
fit of laughter, he gave me to understand,
that he had been egregiously bit in that affair. — 
“You must know, (said she) that a few days
after our adventure with the bawd and her
b&wblank;ches, I found means to be married to that
same fine lady you speak of, and passed the
night with her at her lodgings, so much to
her satisfaction, that early in the morning,
after a good deal of sniveling and sobbing, she
owned, that so far from being an heiress of
a great fortune, she was no other than a common
woman of the town, who had decoyed
me into matrimony, in order to enjoy the privilege
of a femme couverte; and that, unless
I made my escape immediately, I should be
arrested for a debt of her contracting, by bailiffs
employed and instructed for that purpose. 
—Startled at this intimation, I got up in a
twinkling, and taking leave of my spouse with
several hearty damns, got safe into the verge
of the court; where I kept snug, until I was
appointed surgeon's mate of a man of war at
Portsmouth; for which place I set out on a
Sunday, went on board of my ship, in which
I sailed to the Straits, where I had the good
fortune to be made surgeon of a sloop that
came home in a few months after, and was
put out of commission: whereupon I came to
London, imagining myself forgotten and freed
from my wife and her creditors; but had not
been in town a week before I was arrested
for a debt her's, amounting to 20l. and
brought to this place, where I have been fixed
by another action since that time. —However,
you know my disposition; I defy care and 

anxiety; and being on the half-pay list, make
shift to live here tolerably easy.” —I congratulated
him on his philosophy, and remembring
that I was in his debt, repay'd the money he
formerly lent me, which, I believe, was far
from being unseasonable. I then enquired about
the oeconomy of the place, which he explained
to my satisfaction; and after we had agreed to
mess together, he was just going to give orders
for dinner when Strap arrived. 
I never in my life saw sorrow so extravagantly
expressed in any countenance, as in that of my
honest friend, which was, indeed, particularly
adapted by nature for such impressions. —Being
left by ourselves, I communicated to him my
disaster, and endeavoured to console him with
the same arguments he had formerly used to
me, withal representing the fair chance I had
of being relieved, in a short time, by Mr.
Bowling. —But his grief was unutterable; he
seemed to give attention without listening, and
wrung his hands in silence; so that I was in a
fair way of being infected with his behaviour,
when Jackson returned, and perceiving the deference
I payed to Strap, altho' in a footman's
habit, distributed his crumbs of comfort with such
mirth, jollity and unconcern, that the features
of the distressed squire relaxed by degrees,
he recovered the use of speech, and begun to be
a little more reconciled to this lamentable event. 
—We dined together on boiled beef and greens,
brought from a cook's shop in the neighbourhood:
and altho' this meal was served up in a
manner little corresponding with the sphere of
life in which I had lately lived, I made a virtue
of necessity, eat with good appetite, and treated 

my friends with a bottle of wine, which had the
desired effect, of increasing the good humour of
my fellow-prisoner, and exhilarating the spirits
of Strap, who now talked of my misfortune en
Cavalier. 
After dinner Jackson left us to our private affairs; 
when I desired my friend to pack up all
our things, and carry them to some cheap lodging
he should chuse for himself in the neighbourhood
of the Marshalsea, after he had discharged
my lodging, for which I gave him money. —I
likewise recommended to him the keeping my
misfortune secret, and saying to my landlord, or
any other who should enquire for me, that I
was gone into the country for a few weeks: at
the same time I laid strong injunctions upon him
to call every second day upon Banter, in case he
should receive any letters for me from Narcissa,
by the canal of Freeman; and by all means to
leave a direction for himself, at my uncle's lodgings
in Wapping, by which I might be found
when my kinsman should arrive. 
When he departed to execute these orders,
(which, by the bye, were punctually perform'd
that very night) I found myself so little seasoned
to my situation, that I dreaded reflection, and
sought shelter from it in the company of the
beau, who, promising to regale me with a lecture
upon taste, conducted me to the common side,
where I saw a number of naked miserable wretches
assembled together. —We had not been here
many minutes, when a figure appeared, wrapp'd
in a dirty rug, tied about his loins with two pieces
of list, of different colours, knotted together; 
having a black bushy beard, and his head covered
with a huge mass of brown periwig, which 

seemed to have been ravished from the crown of
some scare-crow. —This apparition, stalking in
with great solemnity, made a profound bow to
the audience, who signified their approbation by
a general response of “How d'ye do, doctor?” 
He then turned towards us, and honoured Jackson
with a particular salutation: upon which my
friend, in a formal manner, introduced him to
me, by the name of Mr. Melopoyn. —This ceremony
being over, he advanced into the middle
of the congregation, which crowded around him,
and hemming three times, to my utter astonishment,
pronounced with great significance of voice
and gesture, a very elegant and ingenious discourse
upon the difference between genius and
taste, illustrating his assertions with apt quotations
from the best authors, ancient as well as modern. 
When he had finished his harangue, which lasted
a full hour, he bowed again to the spectators; 
not one of whom (I was informed) understood
so much as a sentence of what he uttered. They
manifested, however, their admiration and esteem
by voluntary contribution, which, Jackson told
me, one week with another, amounted to eighteen
pence. —This moderate stipend, together
with some small presents that he received for
making up differences, and deciding causes amongst
the prisoners, just enabled him to breathe
and walk about in the grotesque figure I have
described. —I understood also, that he was an
excellent poet, and had composed a tragedy,
which was allowed, by every body who had seen
it, to be a performance of great merit; that his
learning was infinite, his morals unexceptionable,
and his modesty invincible. —Such a character
could not fail of attracting my regard; I longed 

impatiently to be better acquainted with him,
and desired Jackson would engage him to spend
the evening in my apartment. —My request was
granted, he favoured us with his company, and
in the course of our conversation, perceiving that
I was not illiterate, and that I had a strong passion
for the Belle Lettres, acquitted himself so
well on that subject, that I expressed a fervent
desire of seeing his productions. —In this too he
gratified my inclination:—he promised to bring
his tragedy to my room next day, and, in the
mean time, entertained me with some detach'd
pieces, which gave me a very advantageous idea
of his poetical talent. —Among other things I
was particularly pleased with some elegies, in
imitation of Tibullus; one of which I beg leave
to submit to the reader, as a specimen of his complexion
and capacity. 

I.
Where now are all my flatt'ring dreams of joy!
Monimia, give my soul her wonted rest;—
Since first thy beauty fix'd my roving eye,
Heart-gnawing cares corrode my pensive breast!

II.
Let happy lovers fly where pleasures call,
With festive songs beguile the fleeting hour;
Lead beauty thro' the mazes of the ball,
Or press her wanton in love's roseate bow'r.


III.
For me, no more I'll range th' empurpled mead,
Where shepherds pipe, and virgins dance around;
Nor wander thro' the woodbine's fragrant shade,
To hear the music of the grove resound.

IV.
I'll seek some lonely church, or dreary hall,
Where fancy paints the glimm'ring taper blue,
Where damps hang mould'ring on the ivy'd wall,
And sheeted ghosts drink up the midnight dew:

V.
There leagu'd with hopeless anguish and despair,
A-while in silence o'er my fate repine;
Then, with a long farewel to love and care,
To kindred dust my weary limbs consign.

VI.
Wilt thou, Monimia, shed a gracious tear
On the cold grave where all my sorrows rest?
Wilt thou strew flow'rs, applaud my love sincere,
And bid the turf lie light upon my breast!
I was wonderfully affected with this pathetic
complaint, which seem'd so well calculated for
my own disappointment in love, that I could not
help attaching the idea of Narcissa to the name 

of Monimia, and of forming such melancholy
presages of my passion, that I could not recover
my tranquility; and was fain to have recourse to
the bottle, which prepared me for a profound
sleep that I would not otherwise have enjoyed. 
—Whether these impressions invited and introduced
a train of other melancholy reflections, or
my fortitude was all exhausted in the effort I made
against despondence, the first day of my imprisonment,
I cannot determine; but I awaked in
the horrors, and found my imagination haunted
with such dismal apparitions, that I was ready to
despair:—and believe the reader will own, that
I had no great cause to congratulate myself,
when I considered my situation. —I was interrupted
in the midst of these gloomy apprehensions
by the arrival of Strap, who contributed
not a little to the re-establishment of my peace,
by letting me know that he had hired himself as
a journeyman-barber; by which means he would
not only save me a considerable expence, but
even make shift to lay up something for my subsistence
after my money should be spent, in case
I should not be relieved before.
