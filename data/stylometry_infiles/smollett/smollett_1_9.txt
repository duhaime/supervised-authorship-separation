Their first attempt: with a digression which
some Readers may think impertinent. 
Be this as it will, our lovers, though real
voluptuaries, amidst the first transports
of their enjoyment, did not neglect the great
political aim of their conjunction. Teresa's
bed-chamber, to which our hero constantly
repaired at midnight, was the scene of their
deliberations, and there it was determined,
that the damsel, in order to avoid suspicion,
should feign herself irritated at the indifference
of Ferdinand, her passion for whom was, by
this time, no secret in the family; and that
with a view to countenance this affectation,
he should upon all occasions treat her with an
air of loftiness and disdain. 
So screened from all imputation of fraud,
she was furnished by him with artful instructions,
how to sound the inclinations of her young
mistress; how to recommend his person and
qualifications by the sure methods of contradiction,
comparison, revilings and reproach; 
how to watch the paroxysms of her disposition,
inflame her passions, and improve, for his advantage,
those moments of frailty, from which
no woman is exempted. In short, this consummate
politician taught his agent to poison
the young lady's mind with insidious conversation,
tending to inspire her with the love of
guilty pleasure, to debauch her sentiments, and
confound her ideas of dignity and virtue. 
After all, the task is not difficult to lead the 

unpractised heart astray, by dint of those opportunities
her seducer possessed. The seeds of
insinuation, seasonably sown upon the warm
luxuriant soil of youth, could hardly fail of
shooting up into such intemperate desires as he
wanted to produce; especially when cultured
and cherished in her unguarded hours, by that
stimulating discourse which familiarity admits,
and the looser passions ingrafted in every
breast, are apt to relish and excuse. 
Fathom had previously reconnoitred the
ground, and discovered some marks of inflammability
in Mademoiselle's constitution; her
beauty was not such as to engage her in those
gaieties of amusement, which could flatter her
vanity, and dissipate her ideas; and she was of
an age, when the little loves and young desires
take possession of the fancy; he therefore concluded,
that she had the more leisure to indulge
those inticing images of pleasure that
youth never fails to create, particularly in
those who, like her, were addicted to solitude
and study. 
Teresa, full fraught with the wily injunctions
of her confederate, took the field, and opened
the compaign with such remakable sourness
in her aspect, when Ferdinand appeared,
that her young lady could not help taking notice
of her affected chagrin, and asked the reason
of such apparent alteration in her way of
thinking. Prepared for this question, the
other replied in a manner calculated for giving
Mademoiselle to understand, that whatever impressions
Ferdinand might have formerly made
on her heart, they were now altogether effaced
by the pride and insolence with which he had 

received her advances; and that her breast now
glowed with all the revenge of a slighted lover. 
To evince the sincerity of this declaration,
she bitterly inveighed against him, and even
affected to depreciate those talents, in which
she knew his chief merit to consist; hoping by
these means to interest Mademoiselle's candour
in his defence. So far the train succeeded:
that the young lady's natural love for truth was
offended at the calumnies that were vented against
Ferdinand in his absence. She chid her
woman for the rancour of her remarks, and
undertook to refute the articles of his dispraise: 
Teresa supported her own assertions with great
obstinacy, and a dispute ensued, in which her
mistress was heated into some extravagant
commendations of our adventurer. 
His supposed enemy did not fail to make a
report of her success, and to magnify every advantage
they had gained; believing in good
earnest, that her lady's warmth was the effect
of a real passion for the fortunate Mr Fathom:
but he himself viewed the adventure in a different
light; and rightly imputed the violence of
Mademoiselle's behaviour to the contradiction
she had sustained from her maid; or to the fire
of her natural generosity, glowing in behalf of
innocence traduced. Nevertheless, he was perfectly
well pleased with the nature of the contest; 
because, in the course of such debates, he
foresaw that he should become habitually her
hero, and that, in time, she would actually believe
those exaggerations of his merit, which
she herself had feigned for the honour of her
own arguments. 
This presage, founded upon that principle of 

self respect, without which no individual exists,
may certainly be justified by manifold occurrences
in life: we ourselves have known a very
pregnant example, which we shall relate,
for the emolument of the reader. A certain
needy author having found means to present a
manuscript to one of those sons of fortune,
who are dignified with the appellation of patrons,
instead of reaping that applause, and advantage,
with which he had regaled his fancy,
had the mortification to find his performance
treated with infinite irreverence and contempt; 
and in high dudgeon and disappointment appealed
to the judgment of another critic, who,
he knew, had no veneration for the first. 
This common consolation, to which all baffled
authors have recourse, was productive of
very happy consequences to our bard: for tho'
the opinions of both judges, concerning the
piece, were altogether the same, the latter, either
out of compassion to the appellant, or desire
of rendering his rival ridiculous in the eye
of taste, undertook to repair the misfortune,
and in this manner executed the plan, in a
meeting of literati, to which both these with
belonged; he who had espoused the poet's
cause, having previously desired another member
to bring his composition on the carpet, no
sooner heard it mentioned than he began to
censure it with flagrant marks of scorn, and
with an ironical air looking at its first condemner,
observed that he must be furiously infected
with the rage of patronizing, who could take
such a deplorable performance into his protection: 
The sarcasm took effect. 
The person against whom it was levelled 

taking umbrage at his presumption, assumed
an aspect of disdain, and replied with great animosity,
that nothing was more easily supported
than the character of a Zoilus, because no production
was altogether free from blemishes,
and any man might pronounce against any piece
by the lump, without interesting his own discernment:
but to perceive the beauties of a work,
it was requisite to have learning, judgment and
taste; and therefore he did not wonder that
the gentleman had overlooked a great many in
the composition which he so contemptuously
decried. A rejoinder succeeded this reply,
and produced a long train of altercation, in
which the gentleman who had formerly treated
the book with such disrespect, now professed
himself its passionate admirer, and held forth in
praise of it with great warmth and elocution. 
Not contented with having exhibited this instance
of regard, he next morning sent a message
to the owner, importing, that he had but
superficially glanced over the manuscript, and
desiring the favour of perusing it a second time; 
being indulged in this request, he recommended
it, in terms of rapture, to all his friends
and dependants, and by dint of unwearied solicitation,
procured a very ample subscription
for the author. 
But, to resume the thread of our story: Teresa's
practices were not confined to simple defamation:
her reproaches were contrived so as
to imply some intelligence in favour of the person
she reviled. In exemplifying his pertness
and arrogance, she repeated his witty repartee; 
on pretence of blaming his ferocity, she recounted
proofs of his spirit and prowess; and in explaining 

the source of his vanity, gave her mistress
to understand, that a certain young lady
of fashion was said to be enamoured of his person. 
Nor did this well-instructed understrapper
omit those other parts of her cue, which the
principal judged necessary for the furtherance
of his scheme. Her conversation became less
guarded, and took a freer turn than usual: she
seized all opportunities of introducing little amorous
stories, the greatest part of which were
invented for the purposes of warming her passions,
and lowering the price of chastity in her
esteem; for she represented all the young
lady's co-temporaries in point of age and situation,
as so many sensualists, who without scruple
indulged themselves in the stolen pleasures
of youth. 
Mean while Ferdinand seconded these endeavours
with his whole industry and address: he
redoubled, if possible, his deference and respect; 
wheted his assiduity to the keenest edge of attention; 
and in short, regulated his dress, conversation
and deportment, according to the
fancy, turn, and prevailing humour of his
young mistress. He moreover attempted to
profit by her curiosity, which he knew to be truly
feminine, and having culled from the library
of his patron, certain dangerous books, calculated
to debauch the minds of young people,
left them occasionally upon the table, in his
apartment, after having directed Teresa to pick
them up, as if by accident, in his absence, and
carry them off for the entertainment of Mademoiselle; 
nay, this crafty projector found means
to furnish his associate with some mischievous
preparations, which were mingled in her chocolate, 

tea or coffee, as povocations to warm
her constitution: yet all these machinations,
ingenious as they were, failed, not only in fulfilling
their aim, but even in shaking the foundations
of her virtue or pride, which stood
their assaults; unmoved, like a strong tower
built upon a rock, impregnable to all the tempestuous
blasts of heaven. 
Not but that the conspirators were more than
once mistaken in the effects of their artifices,
and disposed to applaud themselves on the progress
they had made. When at any time she
expressed a desire to examine those performances
which were laid before her as snares to entrap
her chastity, they attributed that, which
was no other than curiosity, to a looseness of
sentiment; and when she discovered no aversion
to hear those anecdotes concerning the frailty
of her neighbours, they imputed to abatement
of chastity, that satisfaction which was the
result of self-congratulation on her own superior
virtue. 
So far did the treacherous accomplice of Fathom
presume upon these misconstructions,
that she at length divested her tongue of all restraint,
and behaved in such a manner, that the
young lady, confounded and incensed at her indecency
and impudence, rebuked her with great
severity, and commanded her to reform her
discourse, on pain of being dismissed with disgrace
from her service.
