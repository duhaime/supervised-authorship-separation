Pallet conceives an hearty contempt for his fellow-traveller,
and attaches himself to Pickle, who,
nevertheless, persecutes him with his mischievous
talent, upon the road to Flanders. 
In the mean time, his companion having employed
divers pails full of water, in clearing
himself from the squalor of a jail, submitted his
face to the barber, tinged his eye-brows with a
sable hue, and being dressed in his own cloaths,
ventured to visit Peregrine, who was still under
the hands of his valet de chambre, and who gave
him to understand, that his escape had been connived
at, and that the condition of their deliverance
was their departure from Paris in three
days. 
The painter was transported with joy, when
he learnt that he ran no risque of being retaken; 
and far from repining at the terms of his enlargement,
would have willingly set out on his
return to England that same afternoon; for the
Bastile had made such an impression upon him,
that he started at the sound of every coach, and
turned pale at sight of a French soldier. In the
fullness of his heart, he complained of the doctor's
indifference, and related what had passed at
their meeting with evident marks of resentment
and disrespect; which were not at all diminished,
when Jolter informed him of the physician's behaviour,
when he sent for him, to confer about
the means of abridging their confinement. Pickle
himself was incensed at his want of bowels, and
perceiving how much he had sunk in the opinion 

of his fellow-traveller, resolved to encourage
these sentiments of disgust, and occasionally foment
the division to a downright quarrel, which
he foresaw would produce some diversion, and
perhaps expose the poet's character in such a
light, as would effectually punish him for his arrogance
and barbarity. With this view, he levelled
several satirical jokes at the doctor's pedantry
and want of taste, which had appeared so
conspicuous in the quotations he had got by heart,
from ancient authors, in his affected disdain of
the best pictures in the world; which, had he
been endowed with the least share of discernment,
he could not have beheld with such insensibility; 
and lastly, in his ridiculous banquet, which none
but an egregious coxcomb, devoid of all elegance
and sense, would have prepared, or presented to
rational beings. In a word, our young gentleman
played the artillery of his wit against him
with such success, that the painter seemed to
wake from a dream, and went home with the
most hearty contempt for the person he had formerly
adored. 
Instead of using the privilege of a friend, to
enter his apartment without ceremony, he sent
in his servant with a message, importing, that he
intended to set out from Paris next day, in company
with Mr. Pickle, and desiring to know
whether or not he was, or would be prepared
for the journey. The doctor, struck with the
manner as well as the matter of this intimation,
went immediately to Pallet's room, and demanded
to know the cause of such a sudden determination,
without his privity or concurrence; 
and when he understood the necessity of their affairs,
rather than travel by himself, he ordered 

his baggage to be packed up, and signified his
readiness to conform to the emergency of the
case; though he was not at all pleased with the
cavalier behaviour of Pallet, to whom he threw
out some hints of his own importance, and the
immensity of his condescension, in favouring him
with such marks of regard. But by this time
these insinuations had lost their effect upon the
painter, who told him with an arch sneer, that
he did not at all question his learning and abilities,
and particularly his skill in cookery, which
he should never forget while his palate retained
its function; but nevertheless advised him, for
the sake of the degenerate eaters of these days,
to spare a little of his sal armoniac in the next
sillykickaby he should prepare; and bate somewhat
of the devil's dung, which he had so plentifully
crammed into the roasted fowls, unless he
had a mind to convert his guests into patients,
with a view of licking himself whole for the expence
of the entertainment. 
The physician, nettled at these sarcasms, eyed
him with a look of indignation and disdain, and
being unwilling to express himself in English, lest
in the course of the altercation Pallet should be
so much irritated as to depart without him, he
vented his anger in Greek, pronouncing with
great rancour, &GRAs;&grk;&grr;&gri;&grt;&groa;&grm;&gru;&grq;&gre;, &grl;&gri;&grg;&grua;&grst; &grp;&gre;&grr; &gres;&grwg;&grn; &gras;&grg;&gro;&grr;&grh;&grt;&grhg;&grst;,
&GRIs;&grs;&grc;&gre;&gro;, &grm;&grh;&grd;&grap; &gresa;&grq;&gre;&grl;&grap; &gro;&grisc;&gro;&grst; &gres;&grr;&gri;&grz;&grea;&grm;&gre;&grn;&gra;&gri; &grb;&gra;&grs;&gri;&grl;&gre;&gruc;&grs;&gri;&grn;. The painter
though by the sound he supposed this quotation
to be Greek, complimented his friend upon
his knowledge in the Welch language, and
found means to rally him quite out of temper; 
so that he retired to his own chamber in the utmost 

wrath and mortification, and left his antagonist
exulting o'er the victory he had won. 
While these things passed between these originals,
Peregrine waited upon the Embassador,
whom he thanked for his kind interposition, acknowledging
the indiscretion of his own conduct
with such appearance of conviction, and promises
of reformation, that his Excellency freely forgave
him for all the trouble he had been put to
on his account, fortified him with sensible advices,
and assuring him of his continual favour
and friendship, gave him at parting, letters of introduction
to several persons of quality belonging
to the British court. 
Thus distinguished, our young gentleman took
leave of all his French acquaintance, and spent
the evening with some of those who had enjoyed
the greatest share of his intimacy and confidence; 
while Jolter superintended his domestic
concerns, and with infinite joy bespoke a post-chaise
and horses, in orders to convey him from a
place where he lived in continual apprehension of
suffering by the dangerous disposition of his pupil. 
Every thing being adjusted according to
their plan, they and their fellow-travellers next
day dined together, and about four in the afternoon
took their departure in two chaises, escorted
by the valet de chambre, Pipes and the doctor's
lacquey on horseback, well furnished with arms
and ammunition, in case of being attacked by
robbers on the road. 
It was about eleven o'clock at night when they
arrived at Senlis, which was the place at which
they proposed to lodge, and where they were obliged
to knock up the people of the inn, before
they could have their supper prepared. All the 

provision in the house was but barely sufficient to
furnish one indifferent meal; however, the painter
consoled himself for the quantity with the quality
of the dishes, one of which was a fricassee of
rabbit, a preparation that he valued above all the
dainties that ever smoaked upon the table of the
sumptuous Heliogabalus. 
He had no sooner expressed himself to this effect,
than our hero, who was almost incessantly
laying traps for diversion at his neighbour's expence,
laid hold on the declaration; and recollecting
the story of Scipio and the muleteer in
Gil Blas, resolved to perpetrate a joke upon the
stomach of Pallet, which seemed particularly well
disposed to an hearty supper. He accordingly
digested his plan; and the company being seated
at table, affected to gaze with peculiar eagerness
at the painter, who had helped himself to a large
portion of the fricassee, and began to swallow it
with infinite relish. Pallet, notwithstanding the
keenness of his appetite, could not help taking
notice of Pickle's demeanour; and making a
short pause in the exercise of his grinders, “You
are surprized (said he) to see me make so much
dispatch; but I was extremely hungry, and this
is one of the best fricassees I ever tasted: the
French are very expert in these dishes, that I
must allow; and upon my conscience, I would
never desire to eat a more delicate rabbit than this
that lies upon my plate.” 
Peregrine made no other reply to this encomium,
than the repetition of the word rabbit! with
a note of admiration, and such a significant shake
of the head, as effectually alarmed the other,
who instantly suspended the action of his jaws,
and with the morsel half chewed in his mouth, 

stared round him with a certain stolidity of apprehension,
which is easier conceived than described,
until his eyes encountered the countenance
of Thomas Pipes, who being instructed,
and posted opposite to him for the occasion, exhibited
an arch grin, that compleated the painter's
disorder. Afraid of swallowing his mouthful, and
ashamed to dispose of it any other way, he sat
some time in a most distressed state of suspence; 
and being questioned by Mr. Jolter touching his
calamity, made a violent effort of the muscles of
his gullet, which with difficulty performed their
office; and then, with great confusion and concern,
asked if Mr. Pickle suspected the rabbit's
identity. The young gentleman assuming a mysterious
air, pretended ignorance of the matter,
observing, that he was apt to suspect all dishes of
that kind, since he had been informed of the
tricks which were commonly played at inns in
France, Italy and Spain, and recounted that passage
in Gil Blas, which we have hinted at above; 
saying, he did not pretend to be a connoisseur in
animals, but the legs of the creature which composed
that fricassee did not, in his opinion, resemble
those of the rabbits he had usually seen. 
This observation had an evident effect upon the
features of the painter, who with certain signs of
loathing and astonishment, exclaimed, “Lord
Jesus!” and appealed to Pipes for a discovery of
the truth, by asking if he knew any thing of the
affair. Tom very gravely replied, that he did
suppose the food was wholesome enough, for he
had seen the skin and feet of a special ram-cat,
new flea'd, hanging upon the door of a small
pantry adjoining to the kitchen. 

Before this sentence was uttered, Pallet's belly
seemed to move in contact with his back-bone,
his colour changed, no part but the whites of his
eyes were to be seen, he dropped his lower jaw,
and fixing his hands in his sides, reached with
such convulsive agonies, as amazed and disconcerted
the whole company; and what augmented
his disorder, was the tenacious retention of his
stomach, which absolutely refused to part with
its contents, notwithstanding all the energy of
his abhorrence, which threw him into a cold
sweat, and almost into a swoon. 
Pickle, alarmed at his condition, assured him it
was a genuine rabbit, and that he had tutored Pipes
to say otherwise for the joke's sake. But this confession
he considered as a friendly artifice of Pickle's
compassion, and therefore it had little effect upon
his constitution. By the assistance, however, of a
large bumper of brandy, his spirits were recruited,
and his recollection so far recovered, that he was
able to declare, with divers contorsions of face,
that the dish had a particular rankness of taste,
which he had imputed partly to the nature of the
French coney, and partly to the composition of
their sauces; then he inveighed against the infamous
practices of French publicans, attributing
such imposition to their oppressive government,
which kept them so necessitous, that they were
tempted to exercise all manner of knavery upon
their unwary guests. 
Jolter, who could not find in his heart to let
slip any opportunity of speaking in favour of the
French, told him that he was a very great stranger
to their police, else he would know, that if upon
information to the magistrate, it should appear
that any traveller, native or foreigner, has 

been imposed upon, or ill-treated by a publican,
the offender would be immediately obliged to
shut up his house, and if his behaviour had been
notorious, he himself would be sent to the gallies,
without the least hesitation; and as for the
dish which hath been made the occasion of your
present disorder, (said he) I will take upon me
to affirm, it was prepared of a genuine rabbit,
which was skinned in my presence; and in confirmation
of what I assert, though such fricassees
are not the favourites of my taste, I will eat a
part of this without scruple.” So saying, he
swallowed several mouthfuls of the questioned
coney, and Pallet seemed to eye it again with inclination; 
nay, he even resumed his knife and
fork, and being just on the point of applying
them, was seized with another qualm of apprehension,
that broke out in an exclamation of,
“After all, Mr. Jolter, if it should be a real
ram-cat—Lord have mercy upon me! here is
one of the claws.” With these words he presented
the tip of a toe, of which Pipes had snipt
off five or six from a duck that was roasted, and
purposely scattered them in the fricassee: and the
governor could not behold this testimonial without
symptoms of uneasiness and remorse; so that
he and the painter sat silenced and abashed, and
made faces at each other, while the physician,
who hated them both, exulted over their affliction,
bidding them be of good chear, and proceed
with their meal; for he was ready to demonstrate,
that the flesh of a cat was as nourishing
and delicious as veal or mutton, provided
they could prove, that the said cat was not of the
boar-kind, and had fed chiefly on vegetable diet,
or even confined its carnivorous appetite to rats 

and mice, which he affirmed to be dainties of
exquisite taste and flavour. He said, it was a vulgar
mistake to think that all flesh-deavouring creatures
were unfit to be eaten; witness the consumption
of swine and ducks, animals that delight
in carnage, as well as fish, that prey upon
each other, and feed on bait and carrion; together
with the demand for bear, of which the
best hams in the world are made. He then observed,
that the Negroes on the coast of Guinea,
who are a healthy and vigorous people, prefer
cats and dogs to all other fare; and mentioned
from history several sieges, during which the inhabitants,
who were blocked up, lived upon
these animals, and had recourse even to human
flesh, which, to his certain knowledge, was in
all respects preferable to pork; for, in the course
of his studies, he had, for the experiment's sake,
eaten a steak cut from the buttock of a person
who had been hanged. 
This dissertation, far from composing, increased
the disquiet in the stomachs of the governor and
painter, who hearing the last illustration, turned
their eyes upon the orator, at the same instant,
with looks of horror and disgust; and the one
muttering the term Cannibal, and the other pronouncing
the word abomination, they rose from table
in a great hurry, and running towards another
apartment, justled with such violence in the passage,
that both were overturned by the shock,
which also contributed to the effect of their nausea,
that mutually defiled them as they lay.
