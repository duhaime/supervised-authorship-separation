Peregrine amuses his imagination, by slight incursions
upon the territory of vice and folly; reforms
a back-sliding brother, and sends a celebrated
sharper into exile. 
His heart being thus, as it were, suspended
between two objects that lessened the force
of each other's attraction, he took this opportunity
of enjoying some respite, and for the
present detached his sentiments from both; resolving
to indulge himself in the exercise of that
practical satire, which was so agreeable and peculiar
to his disposition. In this laudable determination
he was confirmed by the repeated suggestions
of his friend Cadwallader, who taxed him
with letting his talents rust in indolence, and stimulated
his natural vivacity, with a succession of
fresh discoveries in the world of scandal. 
Thus reinforced, they took the field, and performed
various exploits, to the mortification,
astonishment and dismay of all those coxcombs,
whether male or female, fierce or feeble, insolent
or tame, that hang like tatters on the skirts of
gallantry, and bring the fashion into disgrace. 
As I might trespass upon the patience of the reader,
in giving a minute detail of each adventure
of this kind which they atchieved, I shall content
myself with relating two only, to which indeed
all the rest bore some resemblance. 
Peregrine's intelligencer, who (as we have already
observed) was a privileged person in all
parties, happened one morning to breakfast with
a sort of a great man, who, with a large stock 

of timorous superstition and exterior piety, had
at bottom a spice of carnality, which all his religion
could not extinguish. Among the rest of
his dependants, there was a certain favourite,
who by the most assiduous attention to his humour,
in a course of artful flattery and servile
complaisance, had insinuated himself so far into
his confidence and esteem, that he now acted in
the capacity of his counsellor and director, both
in his spiritual and temporal concerns. 
This cunning parasite having discovered his
patron's infirmity, began to be afraid, that in the
instigations of the flesh, he might be tempted to
employ some other agent for the gratification of
his appetite: and foreseeing that any minister of
this kind would infallibly prove a dangerous rival
to him, in the good graces of his master, he resolved
to anticipate the misfortune, and, with his
other offices, monopolize the functions of a Mercury,
for which his talents were perfectly well
adapted. But this was not the whole of his task; 
he knew there were certain qualms and scruples
of conscience to be removed, as well as other
motives of shyness and distrust, which he durst
not leave to the operation of his friend's own desires,
lest he should choose some other confident; 
he therefore observed the different seasons of his
constitution, and culled the proper opportunities
of expressing a relaxation in his sentiments of chastity; 
which being gratefully received, he proceeded
in the work of conversion, already half
effected by his patron's own passions; and in
conclusion, found a willing dame to quench this
fire that scorched his vitals. He had overnight
obtained her consent, and the particulars of their
meeting were adjusted, in presence of Cadwallader, 

lader, who gave his associate to understand that,
with a view of keeping the rendezvous secret
and mysterious, as well as of saving the lovers
that mutual confusion which the light must have
produced, the scene of their interview was laid
in a summer-house, that stood at the end of his
garden, to which the lady and her conductor
would be admitted in the dark, through backdoor
that should be left open for the purpose. 
Peregrine being made acquainted with these particulars,
together with the hour of assignation,
ordered Pipes to purchase a live calf, and carried
it in a sack, about the twilight, to the back-garden-door,
which our hero entered without hesitation,
disposing himself and his attendants in a
dark alcove immediately under the summer-house,
where (without disengaging the animal from its
covering) he besmeared its front with liquid
phosphorus, and directed Tom to unveil, and
present it to the company at their approach,
while he himself absconded behind a pillar, from
whence he could view the entertainment. They
had continued a whole hour in this situation,
when they perceived by star-light, three persons
enter the postern, and advance towards the place
where they lay; upon which, Pipes began to disentangle
his charge, that he might be ready to
play it off at the proper time; but, as he was not
very expert in this business, the calf finding itself
disengaged from its confinement, sprung all of a
sudden out of his hands, and running directly forwards,
encountered those that approached, and
as it passed them, uttered a loud Baa. 
The gallant, whose passions were exalted to a
pitch of enthusiasm, as susceptible of religious
horror as of love, seeing such an apparition, when 

he was at the point of indulging a criminal appetite,
and hearing the dreadful cry, accompanied
with the terrible word damnation, which Pipes,
in his peculiar tone, exclaimed from the alcove,
when the animal made its escape; he was seized
with consternation and remorse, and falling upon
his face, lay in all the agonies of terror, believing
himself warned by a particular message from
above. His trusty squire, who was not quite so
visionary, recollecting himself from the surprize
he had suffered at the first appearance of such a
glaring phænomenon, which had also such an effect
upon the lady, that she ran out into the
fields, screaming all the way: I say, he no sooner
recovered the faculty of reflection, which this accident
had for some minutes taken away, than
he observed his patron's prostration; and guessing
the condition of his thoughts, resolved to profit
by his sagacity. He accordingly laid himself
gently down upon the cold walk, and lay very
quietly, till the lover, having in a faultring voice
called thrice upon his name, without being favoured
with an answer, raised himself up, and
coming to the spot, shook him by the arm; upon
which he seemed to wake from his trance, and in
a most penitent tone pronounced a very pious
ejaculation, which confirmed the opinion of his
principal who asked him with fear and trembling,
if he had heard the voice and seen the light. Being
an excellent actor, he replied with all the
marks of amazement, that he was struck blind
with a gush of light, far exceeding that of the
sun at noon, and his ears appalled with a voice,
like the sound of many waters, denouncing damnation
to those who obey the lusts of the flesh. 

The converted lover, though he was not sensible
of such extraordinary circumstances of visitation,
implicitely believed every tittle of his account,
imputing the difference of his own perception
to the weakness of his organs, which
were sooner disturbed than those of his purveyor. 
He therefore proposed, that they should adjourn
to the chamber which had been destined for the
scene of his transgression, and with sorrow and
contrition ask pardon of heaven for his intended
offence, acknowledging at the same time, the
seasonable and salutary interposition of providence. 
This duty was accordingly performed, after they
had searched in vain for the nymph, who (the
squire seemed to think) was conveyed by some supernatural
means from the garden; for he said,
as he lay intranced upon the ground, he heard a
rattling like the chariots of Aminadab, and the
shrieks of the young woman gradually sinking in
a distant cadence, as if she had been transported
through the air. 
As this pair of penitents walked up stairs to
the summer-house, the patron, in an extasy
of faith, pronounced, “After this tremendous
scene, who can be so incredulous, so
dead to all conviction, as to doubt the miracle
of the loaves and fishes, or the amazing circumstances
that attended the conversion of St.
Paul?” While they were employed in the exercise
of their devotion, our hero and his attendant
retired by the back-door, which opened into
the fields; and while Pipes went in pursuit of
his calf, which had taken shelter under the wall,
his master proceeded forwards to the place from
whence he had come, where he had agreed to
meet Cadwallader, and communicate the success 

of his enterprize, with which he was perfectly
well pleased. In crossing the field that lay betwixt
him and that part of the town for which
he was bound, he chanced to pass by a heap of
wood, upon which he perceived a woman, tolerably
well dressed, sitting, and holding a smelling-bottle
to her nose. He immediately guessed
her to be the lady whom he had interrupted in
her assignation; and thinking it was incumbent
upon him to make some atonement for the injury
he had done, he accosted her with great politeness
and respect, telling her, he presumed,
from her being in such a solitary place, at such an
hour, that she had met with some misfortune; 
and that, if she would put herself under his protection,
he would defend her from any farther
insult. 
His conjecture was right; this was the individual
inamorata who had fled from the garden,
and who was so terrified at the vision, the meaning
of which she could not comprehend, that
she found herself unable to proceed farther homewards,
and sat down on a log of wood, to enjoy
a little pause of rest, and endeavour to recollect
her dissipated spirits. She had not yet got the
better of her apprehension, which was rather increased
by the darkness of the night and the loneliness
of the place; so that she, without scruple,
embraced the offer of a person who behaved with
such gentle address: and as she was enervated by
fear, he carefully supported her in walking, with
his arm round her waist, encouraging her all the
way with assurances of safety, and expressing his
curiosity to know the adventure, in consequence
of which she had occasion for assistance. She
spoke very little during her passage through the 

field, because, notwithstanding his professions and
appearance, he was still a stranger; and therefore
she could not be altogether easy, while she
thought herself absolutely in his power: but,
when they entered the town, and mingled with
the concourse of people that pass and repass
through all the streets of this metropolis, her diffidence
intirely vanished, and her conversation
became altogether unreserved. 
The remembrance of what had discomposed
her so much in the garden, now afforded subject
for her mirth; and when her conductor still repeated
his desire of information, she could not help
laughing heartily, at the circumstances which his
questions recalled. Encouraged by this manifestation
of good humour, he observed, that as
her spirits were exhausted by the fatigue and disquiet
she had undergone, it would be impossible
for her to walk much farther, and begg'd she
would step with him into the next tavern, where
they might send for an hackney-coach or chair,
in which she would be conveyed to her own lodging. 
After much intreaty, she consented to his
proposal; and he had the pleasure to see, that she
was a very handsome young woman, about the
age of eighteen. 
The joy he felt at this discovery lightened in
his eyes; nor was she able to conceal a certain
alacrity and satisfaction that appeared in her
countenance, when she obtained a distinct view
of her protector's person. In short, she was prevailed
upon to drink a glass of wine; and Peregrine
presuming upon his knowledge of her adventure,
began to make love with great vehemence. 
At first, she pretended to take offence
at his presumption; but, perceiving from certain 

insinuations which he artfully dropp'd, that he
was better acquainted with her character than
she had imagined, her shyness gradually wore off,
and they soon came to a satisfactory explanation; 
in the beginning of which, he frankly unravelled
the whole mystery of the apparition: a discovery
which had almost proved fatal to her, from the
violence of mirth it produced; and she as candidly
disclosed her own private history. She told
him, that her lover's honourable agent had formerly
lived in the house of her mother, who
being a poor widow, supported her family by
letting lodgings; that he had, by the opportunities
of familiarity and friendship, employed
his arts upon her, and actually debauched
this girl, when she was no more than fifteen years
of age; that upon the remonstrances of her mother,
who detected their correspondence, by
perceiving she was with child, he had quitted
the house, with an absolute refusal to provide for
her; so that she was obliged to sue him for the
maintenance of the infant, and reduced to the
necessity of receiving gallants in private; though
she had always managed her occupation in such
a manner, as to preserve her character unsuspected
in the neighbourhood: and lastly, that
her first seducer had lately renewed his correspondence,
by dint of presents and apologies, and
procured her as a virgin for his patron, who
had promised to settle some small provision upon
her for life. 
Peregrine comforted her for her disappointment,
by reciting what he had overheard of the
conversation that passed in the garden, after she
made her elopement; from whence he inferred,
that her interest would suffer no prejudice from 

that interruption; because, in all probability,
her intended lover's flesh would soon get the better
of the spirit again, in spite of a thousand apparitions; 
in which case, he would again have recourse
to her compliance; or, should his superstition
prevail, he would look upon himself as in
duty and conscience bound, to enable her, by a
suitable settlement, to withstand such temptations
for the future. 
She seemed to concur with his opinion, and
was perfectly satisfied with that expectation,
while our hero was more and more engaged by
her easy and agreeable deportment. Her conversation
was that of a gay libertine, who had a
good share of sense and imagination, which, with
a natural vivacity, she employed in accommodating
herself to the humour of her gallant: but
his ears were not disgusted with the nauseous ribaldry
and vulgar-execrations which characterise
the discourse of those nymphs, whose temporary
endearments are solicited by the distinguishing
youth of this refined age. In a word, this accidental
meeting was productive of very agreeable
consequences to both; and an intimacy of intercourse
immediately commenced, the result of
which was, her promising to reserve her favours
for him alone, till farther notice, and to enter
into no measures with the visionary, but such as
he should know and approve. 
Having passed the evening with this new acquaintance,
and informed himself of the particulars
necessary to be known, for the support of the
correspondence they had established, he favoured
her with some marks of his bounty, and repaired
to the lodgings of his friend Crabtree, who was
so much incensed at his breach of punctuality, 

that he ordered himself to be denied; and when
the young gentleman forced his entrance into his
chamber, vi & armis, would not open his mouth; 
but assuming the most grim contraction of his
countenance, sat in sullen silence, till the circumstances
of the adventure, which his associate knew
how to relate to the greatest advantage, gradually
unbended his features to an involuntary smile,
which soon dilated into an unrestrained laugh,
assuring Peregrine of his forgiveness and approbation:
for though (as I have already observed)
this Misanthrope had gained an absolute ascendency
over the muscles of his face, and, when
under the eye of the world, could laugh inwardly,
without betraying the least symptom of mirth,
this self-denial was not exerted without pains; 
and therefore he, in private, indemnified himself
for the trouble he was at, in preserving that inflexible
gravity in public. 
Next day in the evening, our adventurer visited
his fair Phillis, and understood that she had
a message from the new convert, exhorting her
to repentance and reformation, and promising to
support her in her laudable endeavours, as soon as
she should be disposed to begin the great work. 
At the same time, his trusty messenger had talked
of his patron's conversion in the most ludicrous
terms, accounted for the apparition, by affirming,
that it was no other than a dog, with a
paper-lanthorn hanging to his neck, equipped in
that manner by some prentices for their diversion; 
that he had been thrown over the wall, with a
view to frighten the servants of the family; and
not liking his quarters, no sooner perceived the
garden-door opened, than he naturally ran towards
it, in order to make his escape. He likewise 

wise frankly owned, that he had, with a view to
his own interest, encouraged his lord and master
in his superstitious fears, and even counselled him
to execute, in the course of his penitence, a plan
which he had formerly laid, of commencing author,
and espousing in print the cause of miracles,
against the children of perverseness and incredulity:
and in conclusion, this faithful adviser had
made strong love on his own score, proposing to
maintain a correspondence with her, for which
she would be amply recompenced by the bounty
of his patron, whom he undertook to deceive
with a feigned account of her repentance. 
The wench, having an aversion to the character
of this parasite, whom she had too great
reason to know, instead of embracing his proposal
with chearfulness and alacrity, told him
with an affected air of severity, that howsoever
his heart might be hardened against the warnings
of heaven, she had the internal comfort to find
her own breast touched with a due sense of her
unworthiness, and would, by the blessing of providence,
imitate the salutary example of his good
friend, to whom she intended to write an account
of her inward workings, which she hoped were
no other than the motions of the spirit. 
Mr. Mercury hearing this unexpected declaration,
which was delivered with a face of pious
resolution, immediately availed himself of that
hypocrisy, which he possessed to such a consummate
degree; and after having protested with
great earnestness, that what he had said, was uttered
with a view to try whether or not she was
intirely mortified to all the lusts of the flesh, he
applauded her determination with the most lofty
encomiums, and admonished her to perseverance, 

in an enthusiastic harangue; during which, the
tears actually gushed from his eyes, and his looks
adopted a sort of wildness and extatic stare, as if
he had been really transported. 
Though she saw through the disguise, she
seemed convinced of his sincerity; as a confirmation
of which, he gave her his purse, and
took his leave, assuring her that she should never
want, so long as she could retain grace enough
to persist in the happy work she had so righteously
begun. Peregrine approved of her behaviour,
and having instructed her with regard to her future
conduct, returned to his auxiliary and intelligencer,
with whom he concerted another stratagem,
to be practised upon a certain she-gamester
of fashion, and a French adventurer, who, under
the title of count, supported with invincible effrontery,
and a large stock of finesse, had found
means to introduce himself among the quality,
from many of whom he had extracted large sums
of money at play. Among those whom he laid
under contribution, was this lady, who with all
the inclination of a rank sharper, had fallen a sacrifice
to his superior talents, and become his
debtor for five hundred pounds, which she could
not pay without the assistance of her husband,
whom she did not think proper to inform of the
loss. She had for some days evaded the demands
of her creditor, by divers specious pretences,
which, however, were soon exhausted; and he
grew so disagreeably importunate, as to threaten
an application to her lord, if she would not discharge
the debt immediately. 
The lady being a latitudinarian in her principles,
and reduced to great perplexity by these
menaces, could think of no other expedient to 

extricate herself, than that of practising upon
the foreigner's heart, which she accordingly assailed
with all the arts of coquetry, reinforced
by a very agreeable person, to which she had
been often indebted for sundry fortunate events. 
Nevertheless, in all probability she would have
found the count impregnable, had not he, at
this crisis, luckily met with such a flow of success,
as elevated his fancy, and opened his heart
to amorous impressions. In this state of exultation
did he first perceive, or at least acknowledge
the attractions of his debtor, to whom he, in a
billet, declared his passion, and frankly proposed
the alternative, which it was her sole aim to procure. 
After the necessary scruples of decent reluctance,
the affair was compromised, in the hearing
of Cadwallader, who reported to his associate,
that she had given the count an assignation
at the house of a discreet matron, who, under
the denomination of a milliner, kept commodious
apartments for interviews of this kind. 
Peregrine, who was not unknown to this
priestess of love, no sooner received this intelligence,
than he went and bespoke one of her
chambers, contiguous to that which the foreigner
had chosen for his accommodation; and some
time before the hour of their appointment, took
possession of it, accompanied by Crabtree, whom
he had dressed in woman's apparel, because the
Misanthrope would not run the risque of being
observed in propria persona. 
The lovers, true to their contract, met precisely
at the hour; the lady having disguised
herself in an ordinary dishabille, with a capuchin,
the hood of which effectually concealed her 

countenance; and the door of their apartment
being shut, the count found himself on the brink
of enjoying his good fortune, when all of a sudden,
Peregrine, placing himself at the door, pronounced
aloud, in the very voice and manner of
her lord, whom he personally knew, “Stand
firm upon your post, Mr. Constable, and take
care that none shall pass, while I break open the
door, and make sure of the delinquent; for now
I think her ladyship is fairly caught.” 
This exclamation produced an instantaneous
effect in the chamber: the count, terrified at the
prospect of immediate death or prosecution, ran
directly to the window, and throwing up the
sash, would have made his exit into the street,
without ceremony; but my lady, who never
doubted that her husband was at the door, had
recourse to that presence of mind, which never
forsook her upon such occasions; and seizing her
gallant by the collar, exalted her voice, crying,
“Rape! Murder! Rape! Ah villain! do you
attempt my virtue? Are these the laces you invited
me to come and see? Ah, you beastly
monster! Help, good people, help!” 
The noise of these outcries, (in consequence
of which Pickle immediately retreated to his
den) alarmed the whole family. The landlady,
whose reputation was at stake, ran up stairs, accompanied
by two chairmen, who waited for
my lady below; and the door being burst open
by her directions, they found her ladyship in a
violent agitation, holding fast by the count, who
stood without his perriwig, shaking from head
to foot, in all the agony of horror and dismay. 
My lady, finding herself delivered from the attempts
of this ravisher, sunk down upon the 

couch in a swoon; and while the matron of the
house administered to her nostrils, the chairmen
secured the poor gallant, whose faculties were
actually suppressed by the extasy of his fear. 
The lady having a little recollected her spirits,
and looking around, without perceiving her husband,
concluded that he was satisfied of her innocence,
by the artifice of her behaviour, and
omitted to shew himself, that she might not be
shocked at his appearance. On this supposition,
she renewed her clamour against the count, whom
she reviled with the epithets of perfidious wretch,
and abominable ruffian; and expressed her doubts
about the honesty of the house, to which (she
said) he had decoyed her, on pretence of shewing
some laces of a new pattern, that the milliner had
received from abroad. 
The landlady was no stranger to her person
or character, and therefore had never doubted
the truth of the count's information, when he
made her privy to the nature of this interview; 
but her ladyship's present behaviour, (the true
cause of which she did not know) intirely altered
her opinion; and she now believed, that
the count intended to have made her house the
scene of a rape in good earnest. This suggestion
divested her of all regard for her customer,
against whom she exclaimed with great virulence,
as a person who had endeavoured to intail
the curse of infamy upon her house; and
assured the plaintiff, that he had hired the apartment
for a young lady, whom he pretended to
have privately espoused, without the consent of
her parents, from whose inquiries he had reasons
to conceal the place of her abode. 

The rueful foreigner, baited with their joint
invectives, and more than half distracted with
the terrors of an English jury, never dream'd of
attempting to vindicate himself from the imputation
he had incurred; because he imagined the
whole affair was the result of a conspiracy against
his life and fortune; but falling upon his knees
before his accuser, in the most suppliant manner,
implored her pardon, which he offered to acknowledge
by a present of a thousand pounds. 
Had these terms been seasonably proposed, matters
would soon have been brought to an accommodation; 
but she could not decently enter into
a treaty with him, in presence of such witnesses; 
and besides, she believed herself still under the
inspection of her husband. She therefore rejected
his proffer with disdain, observing, that his guilt
was of such a nature, as to preclude all hopes of
forgiveness; and ordered the chairmen to take
charge of his person, until he should be taken into
custody by an officer properly authorized. 
Having given these directions, at which the
poor prisoner wrung his hands in horror and despair,
she withdrew with the matron into another
room, in expectation of being visited by her husband; 
and after having waited some time with
manifest impatience, could not forbear asking if
there were any other lodgers in the house: when
the landlady replied in the negative, she began to
sift her with a variety of questions, in the course
of which she learn'd, that not a soul had entered
the house after her own arrival; and then conjectured,
that the voice she had mistaken for
her husband's, must have been part of a conversation
that passed in the next house, from
which she was separated by a thin party-wall. 

This discovery mortified her in one respect,
and pleased her in another; she was chagrined at
the disagreeable interruption, because it laid her
under the necessity of exposing her character to
the inquiries of those whom her cries had brought
to her assistance; though she was at the same
time very well satisfied to find that her lord was
ignorant of the adventure, and that it was now
in her power to be revenged upon the count, for
the severity of his behaviour, when he acted in
the capacity of her creditor. She therefore resolved
to extort a sum of money from him, by
way of composition; and, under pretence of
hushing up an affair, which might (otherwise)
give scandal an opportunity to be free with her
reputation, signified to her hostess, a desire of
seeing matters compromised. 
The prudent milliner applauded her moderation,
by which she foresaw that her own character
would escape censure; and being favoured
with her ladyship's confidence, went out immediately,
in order to communicate her proposals to
the prisoner; but while these deliberations were
upon the carpet, he had employed his rhetoric so
successfully upon his guard, that they were prevailed
upon to set him at liberty, and make their
own retreat, at the same time. So that her ladyship's
scheme proved abortive, and she was fain
to retire to her own house, meditating further
vengeance upon the fugitive, who did not think
proper to stand the brunt of her indignation; but
decamped that night for his native country, in
which he happily secured his retreat, fully persuaded,
that his ruin had been planned by a powerful
confederacy in England, of which my lady
was the chief instrument. 

Mean while, our young gentleman and his
tutor enjoyed the consternation and perplexity
which they had produced, as an wholesome chastisement
bestowed upon a profligate virago, lost
to all sense of œconomy and decorum, and a just
punishment inflicted upon an infamous adventurer,
who not only pillaged, but also disgraced
the company by whom he was caressed. It was
in consequence of this adventure, that Peregrine
conceived a very ludicrous project, the execution
of which furnished entertainment and admiration
to all the fashionable people in town. The appearance
of Cadwallader in a female dress, was so
uncouth and preternatural, that the good milliner,
who chanced to be favoured with a glimpse
of him, as he went up stairs with his supposed
gallant, was not only astonished, but affrighted
at the peculiarity of his countenance; and notwithstanding
her well-tried discretion, which had
never permitted her curiosity to exceed the
bounds of complaisance, she could not forbear
calling her son Pickle into another room, after
her ladyship's retreat; and asking with manifest
marks of confusion and disquiet, if the person
whom he had brought into her house, was really
and bona fide a woman and a christian; at the
same time, expressing her suspicion, from the
disposition of his companion's wrinkles, and the
bristles that appeared upon her chin, that she
was no better than a witch or a conjurer, whom
he had employed to embroil and expose her customers
by the art of sorcery, for which she
prayed God would forgive him. “Certain I
am (said she) the count and my lady went into
the chamber with the disposition of two lambs,
and in the twinkling of an eye, (Lord have 

mercy upon us!) there was nothing to be heard
but discord and desperation! Ah! Mr. Pickle,
Mr. Pickle! it was for no charitable end, that
you was so anxious to occupy the next room. I
thought there was something unnatural in the
case, when I saw you lead up that old beldame
with the beard. You have ruined the reputation
of my house, Mr. Pickle. My good friends the
countess of Peppermarsh, lady Tickletoe, and
Mrs. Riggle, will never enter my doors again. 
I shall be deprived of getting an honest livelihood; 
and all by the cruelty of one that I loved
as well as if I had been the mother that bore
him. O that ever I was born to see this unlucky
day!” These words she accompanied with sundry
sobs, and a few extempore tears, the nature
of which he perfectly understood; and therefore
prescribed a cordial which in a moment set her
heart at ease.
