Of all kinds of satire, there is none
so entertaining, and universally improving,
as that which is introduced,
as it were, occasionally, in the course
of an interesting story, which brings every
incident home to life; and by representing
familiar scenes in an uncommon and amusing
point of view, invests them with all the
graces of novelty, while nature is appealed
to in every particular. 

The reader gratifies his curiosity, in pursuing
the adventures of a person in whose
favour he is prepossessed; he espouses his
cause, he sympathizes with him in distress,
his indignation is heated against the authors
of his calamity; the humane passions are
inflamed; the contrast between dejected
virtue, and insulting vice, appears with
greater aggravation, and every impression
having a double force on the imagination,
the memory retains the circumstance, and
the heart improves by the example. The
attention is not tired with a bare Catalogue
of characters, but agreeably diverted with
all the variety of invention; and the vicissitudes
of life appear in their peculiar circumstances,
opening an ample field for wit
and humour. 
Romance, no doubt, owes its origin to
ignorance, vanity and superstition. In the
dark ages of the world, when a man had
rendered himself famous for wisdom or valour, 

his family and adherents availed themselves
of his superior qualities, magnified
his virtues, and represented his character
and person as sacred and supernatural. 
The vulgar easily swallowed the bait, implored
his protection, and yielded the tribute
of homage and praise even to adoration; 
his exploits were handed down to posterity
with a thousand exaggerations; they were
repeated as incitements to virtue; divine
honours were paid, and altars erected to his
memory, for the encouragement of those
who attempted to imitate his example; 
and hence arose the heathen mythology,
which is no other than a collection of extravagant
Romances. —As learning advanced,
and genius received cultivation,
these stories were embellished with the
graces of poetry, that they might the better
recommend themselves to the attention; 
they were sung in publick, at festivals, for
the instruction and delight of the audience; 
and rehearsed before battle, as incentives
to deeds of glory. Thus tragedy and the 

epic muse were born, and, in the progress of
taste, arrived at perfection. —It is no
wonder, that the ancients could not relish
a fable in prose, after they had seen so
many remarkable events celebrated in verse,
by their best poets; we therefore, find no
romance among them, during the æra of
their excellence, unless the Cyropædia of
Zenophon may be so called; and it was
not till arts and sciences began to revive,
after the irruption of the Barbarians into
Europe, that any thing of this kind appeared. 
But when the minds of men were
debauched by the imposition of priest-craft
to the most absurd pitch of credulity; the
authors of romance arose, and losing sight
of probability, filled their performances with
the most monstrous hyperboles. If they
could not equal the ancient poets in point of
genius, they were resolved to excel them
in fiction, and apply to the wonder rather
than the judgment of their readers. Accordingly
they brought negromancy to their
aid, and instead of supporting the character 

of their heroes, by dignity of sentiment
and practice, distinguished them by their
bodily strength, activity and extravagance of
behaviour. Although nothing could be
more ludicrous and unnatural than the
figures they drew, they did not want patrons
and admirers, and the world actually
began to be infected with the spirit of
knight-errantry, when Cervantes, by an inimitable
piece of ridicule, reformed the
taste of mankind, representing chivalry in
the right point of view, and converting
romance to purposes far more useful and entertaining,
by making it assume the sock,
and point out the follies of ordinary life. 
The same method has been practised by
other Spanish and French authors, and by
none more successfully than by Monsieur
Le Sage, who in his adventures of Gil Blas,
has described the knavery and foibles of
life, with infinite humour and sagacity. — 
The following sheets I have modelled on
his plan, taking the liberty, however, to 

differ from him in the execution, where I
thought his particular situations were uncommon,
extravagant, or peculiar to the
country in which the scene is laid. — 
The disgraces of Gil Blas, are for the most
part, such as rather excite mirth than compassion; 
he himself laughs at them; and
his transitions from distress to happiness, or
at least case, are so sudden, that neither the
reader has time to pity him, nor himself to
be acquainted with affliction. —This conduct,
in my opinion, not only deviates
from probability, but prevents that generous
indignation, which ought to animate
the reader, against the sordid and vicious
disposition of the world. 
I have attempted to represent modest
merit struggling with every difficulty to
which a friendless orphan is exposed, from
his own want of experience, as well as from
the selfishness, envy, malice, and base indifference
of mankind. —To secure a favourable
prepossession, I have allowed him
the advantages of birth and education, 

which in the series of his misfortunes, will,
I hope, engage the ingenuous more warmly
in his behalf; and though I foresee, that
some people will be offended at the mean
scenes in which he is involved, I persuade
myself the judicious will not only perceive
the necessity of describing those situations
to which he must of course be confined, in
his low estate; but also find entertainment
in viewing those parts of life, where the
humours and passions are undisguised by affectation,
ceremony, or education; and the
whimsical peculiarities of disposition appear
as nature has implanted them. —But I
believe I need not trouble myself in vindicating
a practice authorized by the best
writers in this way, some of whom I have
already named. 
Every intelligent reader will, at first
sight, perceive I have not deviated from
nature, in the facts, which are all true in
the main, although the circumstances are 

altered and disguised to avoid personal satire. 
It now remains, to give my reasons for
making the chief personage of this work
a North-Briton; which are chiefly these: 
I could at a small expence bestow on him
such education as I thought the dignity of
his birth and character required, which
could not possibly be obtained in England,
by such slender means as the nature of my
plan would afford. In the next place, I
could represent simplicity of manners in a
remote part of the kingdom, with more
propriety, than in any place near the capital; 
and lastly, the disposition of the Scots,
addicted to travelling, justifies my conduct
in deriving an adventurer from that country. 
That the delicate reader may not be
offended at the unmeaning oaths which
proceed from the mouths of some persons
in these memoirs, I beg leave to premise, 

that I imagined nothing could more effectually
expose the absurdity of such miserable
expletives, than a natural and verbal representation
of the discourse with which they
are commonly interlarded.
