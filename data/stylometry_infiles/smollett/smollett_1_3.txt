A superficial view of our hero's infancy; 
Having thus bespoke the indulgence of
our guests, let us now produce the particulars
of our entertainment, and speedily
conduct our adventurer through the stage
of infancy, which seldom teems with interesting
incidents. 
As the occupations of his mother would
not conveniently permit her to suckle this her
first-born at her own breast, and those happy
ages were now no more, in which the charge
of nursing a child might be left to the next
goat or the she-wolf, she resolved to improve
upon the ordinances of nature, and foster
him with a juice much more energic than the
milk of goat, or wolf, or woman; this was
no other than that delicious nectar, which, as
we have already hinted, she so cordially distributed
from a small cask that hung before
her, depending from her shoulders by a leathern
zone. Thus determined, 'ere he was yet 

twelve days old, she enclosed him in a canvas
knapsack, which being adjusted to her neck,
fell down upon her back, and ballanced the
cargo that rested on her bosom. 
There are not wanting those who affirm, that
while her double charge was carried about in
this situation, her cag was furnished with a
long and slender flexible tube, which, when the
child began to be clamorous, she conveyed into
his mouth, and strait he stilled himself with
sucking; but this we consider as an extravagant
assertion of those, who mix the marvellous
in all their narrations, because we cannot
conceive how the tender organs of an infant,
could digest such a fiery beverage, which never
fails to discompose the constitutions of the most
hardy and robust: we therefore conclude, that
the use of this potation was more restrained,
and that it was with simple element, diluted
into a composition adapted to his taste and
years. Be this as it will, he certainly was indulged
in the use of it to such a degree, as
would have effectually obstructed his future
fortune, had not he been happily cloyed with
the repetition of the same fare, for which he
conceived the utmost detestation and abhorrence,
rejecting it with loathing and disgust,
like those choice spirits, who, having been
crammed with religion in their childhood, renounce
it in their youth, among other absurd
prejudices of education. 
While he thus dangled in a state of suspension,
a German trooper was transiently smit
with the charms of his mother, who listened
to his honourable addresses, and once more
received the silken bonds of matrimony; the 

ceremony having been performed as usual at
the drum-head. The lady had no sooner taken
possession of her new name, than she bestowed
it upon her son, who was thenceforward
distinguished by the appellation of Ferdinand
de Fadom; nor was the husband offended
at this presumption in his wife, which
he not only considered as a proof of her affection
and esteem, but also as a compliment,
by which he might in time acquire the credit of
being the real father of such an hopeful child. 
Notwithstanding this new engagement with
a foreigner, our Hero's mother still exercised
the virtues of her calling among the English
troops, so much was she biassed by that laudable
partiality, which, as Horace observes, the
natale solum generally inspires: indeed this inclination
was enforced by another reason, that
did not fail to influence her conduct in this
particular; all her knowledge of the high
Dutch language consisted in some words of
traffic, absolutely necessary for the practice of
her vocation; together with sundry oaths and
terms of reproach, that kept her customers in
awe; so that, except among her own countrymen,
she could not indulge that propensity
to conversation, for which she had been remarkable
from her earliest years. Nor did
this instance of her affection fail of turning
to her account in the sequel: She was promoted
to the office of cook to a regimental mess
of officers; and before the peace of Utrecht,
was actually in possession of a suttling-tent,
pitched for the accommodation of the gentlemen
of the army. 
Mean while, Ferdinand improved apace in 

the accomplishments of infancy; his beauty
was conspicuous, and his vigour so uncommon,
that he was with justice likened unto Hercules
in the cradle: the friends of his father in-law,
dandled him on their knees, while he played
with their whiskers, and before he was thirteen
months old, taught, him to suck brandy
impregnated with gun powder, through the
touch-hole of a pistol. At the same time, he
was caressed by divers serjeants of the British
army, who severally and in secret contemplated
his qualifications with a father's pride, excited
by the artful declaration, with which the
mother had flattered each apart. 
Soon as the war was (for her unhappily)
concluded, she, as in duty bound, followed her
husband into Bohemia; and his regiment being
sent into garrison at Prague; she opened a cabaret
in that city, which was frequented by a
good many guests of the Scotch and Irish nations,
who were devoted to the exercise of
arms, in the service of the emperor. It was by
this communication, that the English tongue
became vernacular to young Ferdinand, who,
without such opportunity, would have been a
stranger to the language of his fore fathers, in
spite of all his mother's loquacity and elocution:
though it must be owned, for the credit of
her maternal care, that she let slip no occasion of
making it familiar to his ear and conception; 
for, even at those intervals, in which she could
find no person to carry on the altercation, she
used to hold forth in earnest soliloquies upon
the subject of her own situation, giving vent
to many opprobrious invectives against her
husband's country, between which and old 

England she drew many odious comparisons; 
and prayed without ceasing that Europe might
speedily be involved in a general war, so as
that she might have some chance of reinjoying
the pleasures and emoluments of a Flanders
compaign.
