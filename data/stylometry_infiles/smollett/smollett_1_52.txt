Fathom shifts the scene, and appears in a new
character. 
Fathom's expectations, with respect to
the fair orphan, having thus proved abortive,
he lost no time in bewailing his miscarriage,
but had immediate recourse to other
means of improving his small fortune, which,
at this period, amounted to near two hundred
pounds. Whatever inclination he had to resume
the character he had formerly bore in
the polite world, he durst not venture to launch
out again into the expence necessary to maintain
that station, because his former resources
were now stopt, and all the people of fashion,
by this time, convinced of his being a needy
adventurer. Nevertheless,he resolved to sound
the sentiments of his old friends at a distance,
and judge, from the reception he should meet
with, how far he might presume upon their
countenance and favour: for he rightly supposed,
that, if he could in any shape contribute
to their interest or amusement, they would easily
forgive his former pretensions to quality,
arrogant as they were, and still entertain him
on the footing of a necessary acquaintance. 

With this view, he one day presented himself
at court in a very gay suit of cloaths, and
bowed, at a distance, to many of his old fashionable
friends of both sexes, not one of
whom favoured him with any other notice,
than that of a quarter curt'sy, or slight inclination
of the head: for, by this time, the few
that remembered him knew from what retirement
he now emerged, and avoided him accordingly
as the jail infection: but the greater
part of those who had cultivated him in the
zenith of his fortune, were now utter strangers
to his person, which they had actually
forgot, amidst the succession of novelties that
surrounded them; or, if they did recollect his
name, it was remembered as an old fashion
which had been many months out of date. 
Notwithstanding these mortifying discouragements,
our hero, that same evening, effected a
lodgement in a certain gaming house not far
from St James's; and, as he played pretty high,
and made a parade of his ready money, he was
soon recognized by divers persons of consequence,
who cordially welcomed him to England,
on pretence of believing he had been abroad,
and with great complacency, repeated
their former professions of friendship. Tho'
this was a certain way of retaining the favour
of those worthies, while his finances continued
to flourish, and his payments were prompt,
he knew the weakness of his funds too well,
to think they could bear the vicissitudes of
play; and the remembrance of the two British
Knights who had spoiled him at Paris, hung
over his imagination with the most frightful
presages: besides, he perceived that gaming was 

now managed in such a manner, as rendered
skill and dexterity of no advantage: for the
spirit of play having overspread the land, like
a pestilence, raged to such a degree of madness
and desperation, that the unhappy people
who were infected, laid aside all thoughts of
amusement, œconomy or caution, and risqed
their fortunes upon issues equally extravagant,
childish, and absurd. 
The whole mystery of the art was reduced
to the simple exercise of tossing up a guinea,
and the lust of laying wagers, which they indulged
to a surprising pitch of ridiculous intemperance. 
In one corner of the room might
be heard a pair of lordlings running their grandmothers
against each other, that is, betting sums
on the longest liver; in another, the success of
the wager depended upon the sex of the landlady's
next child; and one of the waiters happening
to drop down in an apoplectic fit, a
certain noble peer exclaimed, “Dead for a
thousand pounds.” The challenge was immediately
accepted; and when the master of
the house sent for a surgeon to attempt the
cure, the nobleman who set the price upon
the patient's head, insisted upon his being left to
the efforts of nature alone, otherwise the wager
should be void; nay, when the landlord harped
upon the loss he should sustain by the death of
a trusty servant, his lordship obviated the objection,
by desiring that the fellow might be charged
in the bill 
In short, the rage of gaming seemed to have
devoured all their other faculties, and to have
equalled the rash enthusiasm of the inhabitants
of Malacca in the East-Indies, who are so possessed 

with that pernicious spirit, that they sacrifice
to it not only their fortunes, but also
their wives and children; and then letting their
hair down upon their shoulders, in imitation
of the ancient Lacedemonians when they devoted
themselves to death, those wretches unsheath
their daggers and murder every living creature
in their way. In this, however, they differ
from the gamesters of our country, who never
find their senses, until they have lost their fortune,
and beggared their families; whereas
the Malayse never run a muck, but in consequence
of misery and despair. 
Such are the amusements, or rather, such is
the continual employment of those hopeful
youths who are destined by birth to be the
judges of our property, and pillars of our constitution; 
such are the heirs and representatives
of those patriots who planned, and those heroes
who maintained the laws and freedom of
their country; who were the patrons of merit,
the fathers of the poor, the terror of
vice and immorality, and, at once, the ornaments
and support of an happy nation. 
Our adventurer considered all these circumstances
with his wonted sagacity, and seeing
upon what precarious footing he must stand,
should he rank himself with such society, he
wisely came to the resolution of descending
one step in the degrees of life, and of taking
upon him the title of physician, under which
he did not despair of insinuating himself into
the pockets of his patients, and into the secrets
of private families, so as to acquire a
comfortable share of practice, or captivate
the heart of some heiress, or rich widow, 

whose fortune would, at once,render him independent
and happy. 
After this determination, his next care was,
to concert measures for his first appearance in
this new character; well knowing, that the
success of a physician, in a great measure, depends
upon the external equipage in which
he first declares himself an adept in the healing
art. He first of all procured a few books
on the subject of medicine, which he studied
with great attention, during the remaining
part of the winter and spring, and repaired to
Tunbridge with the first of the season, where
he appeared in the uniform of Æsculapius,
namely, a plain suit full trimm'd, with a voluminous
tye-perriwig; believing that, in this
place, he might glide, as it were, imperceptibly,
into the functions of his new employment,
and gradually accustom himself to the
method and form of prescription. 
A man so well known in the gay world
could not be supposed to effect such a transformation,
without being observed; and therefore,
in order to anticipate the censure and
ridicule of those who might be tempted to
make themselves merry at his expence, he,
on his arrival at the wells, repaired to the shop
of an apothecary, and, calling for pen, ink
and paper, wrote a prescription, which he desired
might be immediately made up. While
this was doing by the servant, he was invited
into a parlour by the master, with whom he
entered into conversation, touching the properties
of the Tunbridge-water,which seemed
to have been his particular study: and indeed
he had perused Rouzee's treatise on that 

subject, with indefatigable assiduity. From
this theme, he made digressions into other
parts of medicine, upon which he spoke with
such plausible elocution, that the apothecary,
whose knowledge in that art was not very profound,
looked upon him as a physician of
great learning and experience, and hinted a
desire of knowing his name and situation. 
Fathom accordingly gave him to understand,
that he had studied physic, and had taken his
degrees at Padua, rather for his amusement,
than with any view of exercising medicine, as
he then could not possibly foresee the misfortunes
which had since happened to his family,
and by which he was now compelled to have
recourse to a profession that was very much
beneath the expectations of his birth. Yet
he bore his disappointments with resignation,
and even good humour, and blessed his stars
for having inclined him to the study of any
branch of knowledge by which he might be
enabled to laugh at the vicissitudes of fortune. 
He then observed, that he had practised with
some applause at the hot-well, near Bristol,
before he thought he should be ever reduced
to the necessity of taking a fee: and that, in
all probability, his metamorphosis, when
known, would furnish matter of surprise and
merriment to some of his old acquaintance. 
The apothecary was equally struck with his
polite address, and pleased with his agreeable
discourse: he consoled him for the misfortunes
of his family, by assuring him, that, in
England, nothing could be more honourable,
or indeed profitable, than the character of a
physician, provided he could once wriggle 

himself into practice; and insinuated, that,
although he was restricted by certain engagements
with other persons of the faculty, he
should be glad of an opportunity to shew his
regard for Doctor Fathom. This was a very
effectual method which our hero took to intimate
his new character to the public. By
the industry and communicative disposition of
the apothecary, it was circulated in half a day
through every family in the place; and next
morning, when Ferdinand appeared, the company
forthwith assembled in separate groups,
and from each knot he heard his name reverberated
in a whisper. 
Having thus announced himself to all whom
it might concern, and allowed the ladies two
days to discuss the merit of his transfiguration,
together with the novelty of the case,
he ventured to salute, at a distance, a lady
and her daughter, who had been his patients
at the hot-well; and although they honoured
his bow with the return of a slight curtsy, they
gave him not the least encouragement to make
a nearer approach. Notwithstanding this rebuff,
he concluded, that, should the health of
either come in question, they would renew
their application to his skill, and what was refused
by their pride, would be granted by
their apprehension. Here, however, he happened
to be mistaken in his conjecture. 
The young lady being seized with a violent
head-ach and palpitation, her mother desired
the apothecary to recommend a physician; 
and the person, with whom he was contracted,
being at that time absent, he proposed doctor
Fathom as a man of great ability and discretion: 

but the good lady rejected the proposal
with disdain, because she had formerly known
him in the character of a Count; though that
very character was the chief reason that had
then induced her to crave his advice. 
Such is the caprice of the world in general,
that whatever bears the face of novelty captivates,
or rather bewitches the imagination, and
confounds the ideas of reason and common
sense. If, for example, a scullion from the
clinking of pewter should conceive a taste for
the clinking of rhime, and make shift to bring
together twenty syllables, so as that the tenth
and last shall have the like-ending: the composition
is immediately extolled as a miracle; 
and what appeals to the admiration, is not the
wit, the elegance or poetry of the work, but the
uncultivated talent, and humble station of the
author. A reader does not exclaim, “What
a delicate sentiment! what a beautiful simile!
what easy and musical versification!” but cries
in rapture, “Heavens! what a prodigy! a
poet from the scullery! a muse in livery! or,
Apollo with a trowel!” —The public is astonished
into liberality—the scullion eats from
those trenchers he scoured before—the footman
is admitted into the coach, behind which he
was wont to stand; and the bricklayer, instead
of plaistering walls, bedaubs his illustrious part'ner
with the mortar of his praise. Thus, lifted
into an higher sphere, their talents receive cultivation; 
they become professed bards; and
tho' their subsequent works bear evident marks
of improvement, they are neglected among the
rest of their brethren; because that novelty, 

which recommended them in the beginning,
no longer remains. 
So it fared with our adventurer in his new
occupation. There was something so extraordinary
in a nobleman's understanding medicine; 
and so uncommon in a physician's prescribing gratis, that the curiosity and admiration
of the company at Bristol were engaged,
and they followed his advice, as the direction
of some supernatural intelligence: but, now
that he professed himself one of the faculty,
and might be supposed to have refreshed his
memory, and reinforced his knowledge for the
occasion, he was as much overlooked as any
other physician unsupported by interest or cabal; 
or, at least, the notice he attracted was
not at all to the advantage of his character,
because it wholly regarded the decline of his
fortune, which is a never-failing fund of disgrace. 
These mortifications did not overcome the
patience and perseverance of Fathom, who
foresaw that the soothing hand of time would
cast a veil of oblivion over those scenes which
were remembered to his prejudice; and that
in the mean time, though he was excluded
from the private parties of the fair sex, in
which his main hope of success was placed, he
should be able to insinuate himself into some
degree of favour and practice among the
male patients; and some lucky cure, properly
displayed, might be the means of propagating
his fame, and banishing that reserve which at
present interfered with his purpose. Accordingly,
it was not long before he found means
to break that spell of universal prejudice that 

hedged him in. At the ordinary which he
frequented, his polite carriage, facetious remarks,
and agreeable stories, soon conciliated
the regard of his fellow guests, among whom
he sometimes rallied his own transformation
with singular good humour and success: he
was even witty upon his want of employment; 
and used to observe, that a physician, without
practice, had one comfort to which his brethren
were strangers, namely, that the seldomer
he had occasion to prescribe, the less he had
upon his conscience on account of being accessory
to the death of his fellow creatures. 
Nothing so effectually blunts the shafts of
ridicule, and defeats the aims of slander, as this
method of anticipation. In spite of the arrows
that were levelled against his reputation from
every tea-table at Tunbridge, he made his party
good among almost all the gay young gentlemen
that frequented the place: far from
avoiding his company, they began to court his
conversation, and he was commonly seen in the
walks, surrounded with a group of admirers. 
Having thus paved the way for a total removal
of the invidious prepossession that obstructed
his views, he, one night, while every
person was lulled in the arms of repose, and
universal silence prevailed, tuned his violin,
and began to play some masterly airs, in a tone
so uncommonly expressive, and with such ravishing
dexterity of execution, that a certain
lady who lodged in the same house, being waked
by the music, and ignorant of the source
from which it flowed, listened with rapture, as
to the harp of an angel, and wrapping herself
in a loose gown, rose and opened her chamber-door, 

in order to discover in what apartment
the musician resided. She no sooner entered
the passage, than she found her fellow-lodgers
already assembled on the same occasion; and
there they remained during the best part of the
night, transported by the harmony which our
hero produced. 
Doctor Fathom was immediately known to
be the author of this entertainment; and thus
retrieved the benefit of that admiration which
he had forfeited by appearing in the shape of
a physician. For, as people had formerly
wondered to see a Count skilled in medicine; 
they were now amazed to find a physician such
a master in music. 
The good effects of this stratagem were
almost instantaneous. His performance became
the topic of discourse among all the
fashionable company: his male friends complimented
him from the information of the
other sex; and that lady whom he had regaled,
instead of that shyness and disdain with which
she used to receive his salutation, at their very
next meeting in the thorough-fare, returned
his bow with marks of profound respect. 
Nay, at midnight, she, with the rest, took post
in the same place where they had been stationed
before; and by frequent tittering, and repeated
whispers, gave intimation to Fathom, that they
would be glad of a second serenade. But he
was too well acquainted with the human passions
to indulge this their desire: it was his interest
to inflame their impatience, rather than to
gratify their expectation: and therefore he
tantalized them for some hours, by tuning his
violin, and playing some flourishes, which, 

however, produced nothing to fulfill their
wishes. 
At the ordinary, he was accosted by a gentleman
a lodger in the same house, who assured
him, that the ladies would take it as a great
favour, if he would let them know when he
intended to amuse himself again with his instrument,
that they might not, by falling asleep
before-hand, deprive themselves of the pleasure
of hearing his music. To this message he replied
with an air of consequence and reserve,
that, though music was not the art he professed,
he should be always complaisant enough to entertain
the ladies to the utmost of his power,
when their commands were signified to him in
a manner suited to his character; but that he
would never put himself on the footing of an
itinerant harper, whose music is tolerated thro'
the medium of a board partition. The gentleman
having reported this answer to his constituents,
they empowered him to invite doctor
Fathom to breakfast, and he was next morning
introduced with the usual ceremony, and treated
with uncommon regard by all the females of
the house, assembled for his reception. 
Having thus broke the ice of their aversion,
in one part, so as that the beams of his personal
accomplishments had room to operate, he soon
effected a general thaw in his favour, and found
himself growing once more into request among
the most amiable part of the creation. His
company was coveted, and his taste consulted
in their balls, concerts, and private assemblies; 
and he recompenced the regard they paid to
him, with an incessant exertion of his agreeable
talents, politeness, and good humour.
