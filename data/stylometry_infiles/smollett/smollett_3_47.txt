Acquires a distinct idea of the French government; 
quarrels with a mousquetaire, whom he afterwards
fights and vanquishes, after having punished
him for interfering in his amorous recreations. 
Among many other instances of the same
nature, I believe it will not be amiss to
exhibit a few specimens of their administration,
which happened during his abode at Paris, that
those who have not the opportunity of observing
for themselves, or are in danger of being influenced
by misrepresentation, may compare their
own condition with that of their neighbours, and
do justice to the constitution under which they
live. 
A lady of distinguished character having been
lampooned by some obscure scribler, who could
not be discovered, the ministry, in consequence
of her complaint, ordered no fewer than five and
twenty abbés to be apprehended and sent to the
Bastile, on the maxim of Herod, when he commanded
the innocents to be murdered, hoping
that the principal object of his cruelty would
not escape in the general calamity; and the
friends of those unhappy prisoners durst not even
complain of the unjust persecution, but shrugged
up their shoulders, and in silence deplored their
misfortune, uncertain whether or not they should
ever set eyes on them again. 
About the same time, a gentleman of family,
who had been oppressed by a certain powerful
duke that lived in the neighbourhood, found 

means to be introduced to the king, who receiving
his petition very graciously, asked in
what regiment he served; and when the memorialist
answered, that he had not the honour of
being in the service, returned the paper unopened,
and refused to hear one circumstance of his
complaint; so that, far from being redressed, he
remained more than ever exposed to the tyranny
of his oppressors: nay, so notorious is the discouragement
of all those who presume to live
independent of court-favour and connexions,
that one of the gentlemen, whose friendship Peregrine
cultivated, frankly owned he was in possession
of a most romantic place in one of the
provinces, and deeply enamoured of a country
life; and yet he durst not reside upon his own
estate, lest by slackening in his attendance upon
the great, who honoured him with their protection,
he should fall a prey to some rapacious
intendant. 
As for the common people, they are so much
inured to the scourge and insolence of power,
that every shabby subaltern, every beggarly cadet
of the noblesse, every low retainer to the court,
insults and injures them with impunity. A certain
Ecuyer, or horse-dealer, belonging to the
king, being one day under the hands of a barber,
who by accident cut the head of a pimple on his
face, he started up, and drawing his sword,
wounded him desperately in the shoulder. The
poor tradesman, hurt as he was, made an effort
to retire, and was followed by this barbarous assassin,
who not contented with the vengeance he
had taken, plunged his sword a second time into
his body, and killed him on the spot. Having 

performed this inhuman exploit, he dressed himself
with great deliberation, and going to Versailles,
immediately obtained a pardon for what
he had done; triumphing in his brutality with
such insolence, that the very next time he had
occasion to be shaved, he sat with his sword ready
drawn, in order to repeat the murder, in case
the barber should commit the same mistake. Yet
so tamed are those poor people to subjection, that
when Peregrine mentioned this assassination to
his own trimmer, with expressions of horror and
detestation, the infatuated wretch replied, that
without all doubt it was a misfortune, but it proceeded
from the gentleman's passion; and observed,
by way of encomium on the government,
that such vivacity is never punished in
France. 
A few days after this outrage was committed,
our youth, who was a professed enemy to all
oppression, being in one of the first loges at the
comedy, was eye-witness of an adventure which
filled him with indignation: a tall, ferocious fellow
in the parterre, without the least provocation,
but prompted by the meer wantonness of
pride, took hold of the hat of a very decent young
man who happened to stand before him, and
twirled it round upon his head. The party thus
offended turned to his aggressor, and civilly asked
the reason of such treatment; but he received no
answer; and when he looked the other way, the
insult was repeated: upon which he expressed his
resentment as became a man of spirit, and desired
the offender to walk out with him. No sooner
did he thus signify his intention, than his adversary,
swelling with rage, cocked his hat fiercely
in his face, and fixing his hands in his sides, pronounced 

with the most imperious tone, “Heark
ye, Mr. Round Periwig, you must know that I
am a mousquetaire.” Scarce had this awful word
escaped from his lips, when the blood forsook the
lips of the poor challenger, who with the most
abject submission begged pardon for his presumption,
and with difficulty obtained it, on condition
that he should immediately quit the place. 
Having thus exercised his authority, he turned
to one of his companions, and with an air of
disdainful ridicule, told him he was like to have
had an affair with a Bourgeois; adding, by way
of heightening the irony, “Egad! I believe he's
a physician.” 
Our hero was so much shocked and irritated
at this licentious behaviour, that he could not
suppress his resentment, which he manifested, by
saying to this Hector, “Sir, a physician may be
a man of honour.” To this remonstrance,
which was delivered with a very significant countenance,
the mousquetaire made no other reply,
but that of ecchoing his assertion with a loud
laugh, in which he was joined by his confederates; 
and Peregrine glowing with resentment, called
him a Fanfaron, and withdrew, in expectation
of being followed into the street. The other
understood the hint, and a rencounter must have
ensued, had not the officer of the guard, who
overheard what passed, prevented their meeting,
by putting the mousquetaire immediately under
arrest. Our young gentleman waited at the door
of the parterre, until he was informed of this
interposition, and then went home very much
chagrined at his disappintment; for he was an
utter stranger to fear and diffidence on these occasions,
and had set his heart upon chastising the 

insolence of this bully, who had treated him with
such disrespect. 
This adventure was not so private but that
it reached the ears of Mr. Jolter, by the canal
of some English gentlemen who were present
when it happened; and the governor, who entertained
a most dreadful idea of the mousquetaires,
being alarmed at a quarrel, the consequence of
which might be fatal to his charge, waited on
the British embassador, and begged he would
take Peregrine under his immediate protection. 
His excellency having heard the circumstances
of the dispute, sent one of his gentlemen to invite
the youth to dinner; and after having assured
him that he might depend upon his countenance
and regard, represented the rashness and impetuosity
of his conduct so much to his conviction,
that he promised to act more circumspectly for
the future, and drop all thoughts of the mousquetaire
from that moment. 
A few days after he had taken this laudable resolution,
Pipes, who had carried a billet to his
mistress, informed him, that he had perceived a
laced hat lying upon a marble slab in her apartment; 
and that when she came out of her own
chamber to receive the letter, she appeared in
manifest disorder. 
From these hints of intelligence, our young
gentleman suspected, or rather made no doubt of
her infidelity; and being by this time well nigh
cloyed with possession, was not sorry to find that
she had given him cause to renounce her correspondence. 
That he might therefore detect
her in the very breach of duty, and at the same
time punish the gallant who had the presumption
to invade his territories, he concerted with himself 

a plan, which was executed in this manner: 
During his next interview with his Dulcinea,
far from discovering the least sign of jealousy or
discontent, he affected the appearance of extraordinary
fondness; and after having spent the
afternoon with the shew of uncommon satisfaction,
told her he was engaged in a party for
Fountainbleau, and would set out from Paris that
same evening; so that he should not have the
pleasure of seeing her again for some days. 
The lady, who was very well versed in the
arts of her occupation, pretended to receive this
piece of news with great affliction, and conjured
him with such marks of real tenderness, to return
as soon as possible to her longing arms, that he went
away almost convinced of her sincerity. Determined,
however, to prosecute his scheme, he
actually departed from Paris with two or three
gentlemen of his acquaintance, who had hired a
Remise for a jaunt to Versailles; and having accompanied
them as far as the village of Passé, returned
in the dusk of the evening on foot. 
He waited impatiently till midnight, and then
arming himself with a pair of pocket-pistols, and
attended by trusty Tom with a cudgel in his
hand, repaired to the lodgings of his suspected
inamorata; and having given Pipes his cue,
knocked gently at the door, which was no sooner
opened by the lacquey than he bolted in, before
the fellow could recollect himself from the confusion
occasioned by his unexpected appearance; 
and leaving Tom to guard the door, ordered the
trembling valet to light him up stairs into his lady's
apartment. The first object that presented
itself to his view, when he entered the antichamber,
was a sword upon the table, which he 

immediately seized, exclaiming in a loud and menacing
voice, that his mistress was false, and then
in bed with another gallant, whom he would
instantly put to death. This declaration, confirmed
by many terrible oaths, he calculated for
the hearing of his rival, who understanding his
sanguinary purpose, started up in great trepidation,
and naked as he was, dropt from the
balcony into the street, while Peregrine thundered
at the door for admittance; and guessing
his design, gave him an opportunity of making
this precipitate retreat. Pipes, who stood centinel
at the door, observing the fugitive descend,
attacked him with his cudgel, and sweating him
from one end of the street to the other, at last
committed him to the guet, by whom he was
conveyed to the officer on duty in a most disgraceful
and deplorable condition. 
Mean while, Peregrine having burst open the
chamber-door, found the lady in the utmost
dread and consternation, and the spoils of her
favourite scattered about the room: but his resentment
was doubly gratified, when he learnt
upon inquiry, that the person who had been so disagreeably
interrupted, was no other than that individual
mousquetaire with whom he had quarreled
at the comedy. He upbraided the nymph with
her perfidy and ingratitude, and telling her that
she must not expect the continuance of his regard,
or the appointments which she had hitherto
enjoyed from his bounty, went home to his own
lodgings, overjoyed at the issue of the adventure. 
The soldier, exasperated at the disgrace he
had undergone, as well as at the outragious insult
of the English valet, whom he believed his
master had tutored for that purpose, no sooner 

extricated himself from the opprobrious situation
he had incurred, than breathing vengeance against
the author of the affront, he came to Peregrine's
apartment, and demanded satisfaction upon the
ramparts next morning before sun-rise. Our
hero assured him, he would not fail to pay his respects
to him at the time and place appointed; 
and foreseeing that he might be prevented from
keeping this engagement by the officious care of
his governor, who saw the mousquetaire come in,
he told Mr. Jolter, that the Frenchman had visited
him in consequence of an order he had received
from his superiors, to make an apology for
his rude behaviour to him in the playhouse, and
that they had parted very good friends. This
assurance, together with Pickle's tranquil and
unconcerned behaviour thro' the day, quieted the
terrors which had begun to take possession of his
tutor's imagination; so that the youth had an
opportunity of giving him the slip at night, when
he betook himself to the lodgings of a friend,
whom he engaged as his second, and with whom
he immediately took the field, in order to avoid
the search which Jolter, upon missing him, might
set on foot. 
This was a necessary precaution; for as he
did not appear at supper, and Pipes, who usually
attended him in his excursions, could give no account
of his motions, the governor was dreadfully
alarmed at his absence, and ordered his man
to run in quest of his master to all the places
which he used to frequent, while he himself went
to the commissaire, and communicating his suspicions,
was accommodated with a party of the
horse-guards, who patroled round all the environs
of the city, with a view of preventing the rencounter. 

Pipes might have directed them to the
lady, by whose information they could have learnt
the name and lodgings of the mousquetaire, who
being apprehended, the duel would not have happened; 
but he did not choose to run the risk of
disobliging his master, by intermeddling in the
affair, and was, moreover, very desirous that the
Frenchman should be humbled; for he never
doubted that Peregrine was more than a match
for any two men in France. In this confidence,
therefore, he sought his master with great diligence,
not with a view of disappointing his intention,
but in order to attend him to the battle, that
he might stand by him, and see justice done. 
While this inquiry was carried on, our hero
and his companion concealed themselves among
some weeds that grew on the edge of the parapet,
a few yards from the spot where he had agreed to
meet the mousquetaire; and scarce had the morning
rendered objects distinguishable, when they
perceived their men advancing boldly to the place. 
Peregrine seeing them approach, sprung forward
to the ground, that he might have the glory of
anticipating his antagonist; and swords being
drawn, all four were engaged in a twinkling. 
Pickle's eagerness had well nigh cost him his life; 
for, without minding his footing, he flew directly
to his opposite, and stumbling over a stone,
was wounded on one side of his head before he
could recover his attitude. Far from being disspirited
at this check, it served only to animate
him the more; being endowed with uncommon
agility, he retrieved his posture in a moment,
and having parried a second thrust, returned the
longe with such incredible speed, that the soldier
had not time to resume his guard, but was immediately 

run through the bend of his right arm; 
and the sword dropping out of his hand, our hero's
victory was compleat. 
Having dispatched his own business, and received
the acknowledgment of his adversary, who
with a look of infinite mortification observed,
that his was the fortune of the day, he ran to
part the seconds, just as the weapon was twisted
out of his companion's hand: upon which he
took his place; and, in all likelihood, an obstinate
dispute would have ensued, had they not
been interrupted by the guard, at sight of whom
the two Frenchmen scampered off, while our
young gentleman and his friend allowed themselves
to be taken prisoners by the detachment
which had been sent out for that purpose, and
were carried before the magistrate, who having
sharply reprimanded them for presuming to act
in contempt of the laws, set them at liberty, in
consideration of their being strangers, cautioning
them at the same time to beware of such exploits
for the future. 
When Peregrine returned to his own lodgings,
Pipes seeing the blood trickling down upon his
master's neckcloth and solitaire, gave evident tokens
of surprize and concern, not for the consequences
of the wound, which he did not suppose
dangerous, but for the glory of Old England,
which he was afraid had suffered in the engagement; 
for, he could not help saying, with an air
of chagrin, as he followed the youth into his
chamber, “I do suppose as how you gave that
lubberly Frenchman as good as he brought.”
