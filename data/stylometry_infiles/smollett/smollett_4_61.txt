Miss Williams informs me of Narcissa's approbation
of my flame—I appease the
Squire—write to my Mistress, am blessed
with an answer—beg leave of her brother
to dance with her at a ball; obtain
his consent and her's—enjoy a private
conversation with her—am perplexed with
reflections—have the honour of appearing
her partner at the ball—we are
complimented by a certain Nobleman—he discovers
some symptoms of passion for Narcissa
—I am stung with jealousy—Narcissa
alarmed, retires—I observe Melinda
in the company—the Squire is captivated
by her beauty. 
I was met next morning, at the usual place
by Miss Williams, who gave me joy of the
progress I had made in the affection of her mistress,
and blessed me with an account of that dear
creature's conversation with her, after she had
retired the night before from our company. — 
I could scarce believe her information, when
she recounted her expressions in my favour, so much
more warm and passionate were they than my
most sanguine hopes had presaged; and was particularly
pleased to hear that she approved of my
behaviour to her brother, after she withdrew. — 

Transported at the news of my happiness, I
presented my ring to the messenger, as a testimony
of my gratitude and satisfaction; but she was
above such mercenary considerations, and refused
my compliment with some resentment, saying,
she was not a little mortified to see my opinion
of her so low and contemptible. —I did myself a
piece of justice by explaining my behaviour on
this head, and to convince her of my esteem,
promised to be ruled by her directions in the prosecution
of the whole affair, which I had so
much at heart, that the repose of my life depended
upon the consequence. 
As I fervently wished for another interview,
where I might pour out the effusions of my love,
without danger of being interrupted, and perhaps
reap some endearing return from the queen
of my desires, I implored her advice and assistance
in promoting this event;—but she gave me
to understand, that Narcissa would make no precipitate
compliances of this kind, and that I
would do well to cultivate her brother's acquaintance,
in the course of which, I would not want
opportunities of removing that reserve, which my
mistress thought herself obliged to maintain during
the infancy of our correspondence. —In the
mean time, she promised to tell her lady that I
had endeavoured by presents and persuasions, to
prevail upon her, (Miss Williams) to deliver a
letter from me, which she had refused to charge
herself with, until she should know Narcissa's
sentiments of the matter; and said, by these
means she did not doubt of being able to open a
literary communication between us, which could
not fail of introducing more intimate connexions. 

I approved of her counsel, and our appointment
being renewed for next day, left her with an
intent of falling upon some method of being reconciled
to the Squire, who, I supposed, would
be offended with the trick we had put upon him. 
—With this view, I consulted Freeman, who
from his knowledge of the Fox-hunter's disposition,
assured me there was no other method
of pacifying him, than that of sacrificing
ourselves for one night, to an equal match with
him in drinking: This I found myself necessitated
to comply with, for the interest of my passion,
and therefore determined to commit the
debauch at my own lodgings, that I might run
no risk of being discovered by Narcissa, in a
state of brutal degeneracy. —Mr. Freeman, who
was to be of the party, went, at my desire, to the
Squire in order to engage him, while I took care
to furnish myself for his reception. —My invitation
was accepted, my guests honoured me with
their company in the evening, when Bruin gave
me to understand that he had drank many tuns
of wine in his life, but was never served such a
trick as I had played upon him the night before. 
I promised to atone for my trespass, and having
ordered to every man his bottle, began the contest
with a bumper to the health of Narcissa. — 
The toasts circulated with great devotion, the
liquor began to operate, our mirth grew noisy,
and as Freeman and I had the advantage of
drinking small French claret, the savage was effectually
tamed before our senses were in the
least affected, and carried home in a kind of apoplexy
of drunkenness. 
I was next morning, as usual, favoured with a
visit from my kind and punctual confidante, who 

telling me, she was permitted to receive my letters
for her mistress; I took up the pen immediately,
and following the first dictates of my passion,
wrote as follows: 

“Dear Madam,
Were it possible for the powers of utterance,
to reveal the soft emotions of my
soul; the fond anxiety, the glowing hopes,
and chilling fears that rule my breast by turns; 
I should need no other witness than this paper,
to evince the purity and ardour of that flame
your charms have kindled in my heart. But
alas! expression wrongs my love! I am inspired
with conceptions that no language can
convey! Your beauty fills me with wonder!
your understanding with ravishment, and your
goodness with adoration! I am transported
with desire, distracted with doubts, and tortured
with impatience! Suffer me then, lovely
arbitress of my fate, to approach you in person,
to breathe in soft murmurs my passion to your
ear, to offer the sacrifice of a heart overflowing
with the most genuine and disinterested
love; to gaze with exstasy on the divine object
of my wishes, to hear the musick of her
enchanting tongue! to rejoice in her smiles
of approbation, and banish the most intolerable
suspence from the bosom of 
“Your enraptured
R&wblank; R&wblank;,” 

Having finished this effusion, I committed it to
the care of my faithful friend, with an injunction
to second my intreaty with all her eloquence and
influence; and in the mean time went to dress, with
an intention of visiting Mrs. Snapper and Miss,
whom I had utterly neglected and indeed almost
forgot, since my dear Narcissa had resumed the empire
of my soul. The old gentlewoman received me
very kindly, and Miss affected a frankness and gaiety,
which, however, I could easily perceive was forced
and dissembled; among other things, she pretended
to joke me upon my passion for Narcissa, which
she averred was no secret, and asked if I intended
to dance with her at the next assembly. —I was a
good deal concerned to find myself become the
town-talk on this subject, lest the Squire, having
notice of my inclinations, should disapprove of
them, and by breaking off all correspondence
with me, deprive me of the opportunities I now
enjoyed. —But I resolved to use the interest I had
with him, while it lasted; and that very night,
meeting him occasionally, asked his permission to
solicit her company at the ball, which he very
readily granted, to my inexpressible satisfaction. 
Having been kept awake the greatest part of
the night, by a thousand delightful reveries that
took possession of my fancy, I got up betimes,
and flying to the place of rendezvous, had in a
little time the pleasure of seeing Miss Williams
approach with a smile on her countenance, which
I interpreted into a good omen. Neither was I
mistaken in my presage: She presented me with
a letter from the idol of my soul, which, after
having kissed it with great devotion, I opened
with the utmost eagerness, and was blessed with
her approbation in these terms. 


“SIR,
To say I look upon you with indifference,
would be a piece of dissimulation which,
I think, no decorum requires, and no custom
can justify. As my heart never felt an impression
that my tongue was ashamed to declare,
I will not scruple to own myself pleased with
your passion, confident of your integrity, and
so well convinced of my own discretion, that
I should not hesitate in granting you the interview
you desire, were I not over-awed
by the prying curiosity of a malicious world,
the censure of which might be fatally prejudicial
to the reputation of 
“Your
Narcissa.” 
No Anchorite in the exstasy of devotion, ever
adored a relique with more fervour than that
with which I kissed this inimitable proof of my
charmer's candour, generosity and affection! I
read it over an hundred times; was ravished with
her confession in the beginning; but the subscription
of Your Narcissa, yielded me such
delight as I had never felt before! My happiness
was still increased by Miss Williams, who blessed
me with a repetition of her lady's tender expressions
in my favour, when she received and read
my letter. —In short, I had all the reason in the
world to believe that this gentle creature's bosom
was possessed by a passion for me, as warm, 

though perhaps not so impetuous, as mine for
her. 
I informed my friend of the Squire's consent,
with regard to my dancing with Narcissa at the
ball, and desired her to tell her mistress, that I
would do myself the honour of visiting her in
the afternoon, in consequence of his permission,
when I hoped to find her as indulgent as her
brother had been complaisant in that particular. 
—Miss Williams expressed a good deal of joy,
at hearing I was so much in favour with the
fox-hunter, and ventured to assure me, that my
visit would be very agreeable to my mistress,
the rather because Bruin was engaged to dine
abroad. —This was a circumstance, which I
scarce need say, pleased me. —I went immediately
to the long-room, where I found him, and affecting
to know nothing of his engagement, told
him, I would do myself the pleasure to wait
upon him in the afternoon, and to present his
sister with a ticket for the ball. —He shook me
by the hand, according to custom, and giving
me to understand that he was to dine abroad,
desired me to go and drink tea with Narcissa
notwithstanding, and promised to prepare her
for my visit in the mean time. 
Every thing succeeding thus to my wish, I
waited with incredible patience for the time,
which no sooner arrived, than I hastened to the
scene, which my fancy had pre-occupied long before. 
—I was introduced accordingly, to the dear
enchantress, whom I found accompanied by Miss
Williams, who, on pretence of ordering tea, retired
at my approach. —This favourable accident,
which alarmed my whole soul, disordered her
also. —I found myself actuated by an irresistible 

impulse, I advanced to her with eagerness and
awe; and profiting by the confusion that prevailed
over her, clasped the fair angel in my
arms, and imprinted a glowing kiss upon her
lips, more soft and fragrant than the dewy rosebud
just bursting from the stem! Her face was
in an instant covered with blushes, her eyes
sparkled with resentment; I threw myself at her
feet, and implored her pardon. —Her love became
advocate in my cause; her look softened into
forgiveness, she raised me up, and chid me with
so much sweetness of displeasure, that I was
tempted to repeat the offence, had not the coming
of a servant with the tea-board, prevented my
presumption. —While we were subject to be
interrupted or over-heard, we conversed about
the approaching ball, at which she promised to
grace me as a partner; but when the equipage
was removed, and we were left alone, I resumed
the more interesting theme, and expressed myself
with such transport and agitation, that my mistress,
fearing I would commit some extravagance,
rung the bell for her maid, whom she detained
in the room, as a check upon my vivacity. — 
I was not sorry for this precaution, because I could
unbosom myself without reserve, before Miss Williams,
who was the confidante of us both. —I therefore
gave a loose to the inspirations of my passion,
which operated so successfully upon the tender
affections of Narcissa, that she laid aside the restraint
she had hitherto wore, and blessed me
with the most melting declaration of her mutual
flame! —It was impossible for me to forbear taking
the advantage of this endearing condescension. 
—She now gently yielded to my embrace,
while I encircling all that I held dear, within 

my arms, tasted in advance, the joys of that paradise
I hoped in a little time wholly to possess! 
—We spent the afternoon in all the exstacy of
hope that the most fervent love exchanged by
mutual vows could inspire; and Miss Williams
was so much affected with our chaste caresses,
which recalled the sad remembrance of what she
was, that her eyes were filled with tears. 
The evening being pretty far advanced, I
forced myself from the dear object of my flame,
who indulged me in a tender embrace at parting; 
and repairing to my lodgings, communicated to
my friend Strap every circumstance of my happiness,
which filled him with so much pleasure,
that it run over at his eyes; and he prayed heartily,
that no envious devil might, as formerly, dash
the cup of blessing from my lip. —When I reflected
on what had happened, and especially on
the unreserved protestations of Narcissa's love,
I could not help being amazed at her omitting to
enquire into the particular circumstances of the
life and fortune of one whom she had favoured
with her affection, and I began to be a little anxious
about the situation of her finances; well
knowing that I should do an irreparable injury to
the person my soul held most dear, if I should
espouse her, without being enabled to support her
in the rank which was certainly her due. —I had
heard indeed, while I served her aunt, that her
father had left her a considerable sum; and that
every body believed she would inherit the greatest
part of her kinswoman's dowry, but I did not
know how far she might be restricted by the old
gentleman's will, in the enjoyment of what
he left her; and I was too well informed of the
virtuosi's late conduct, to think my mistress could 

have any expectations from that quarter. —I confided,
however, in the good sense and delicacy
of my charmer, who, I was sure, would not
consent to unite her fate with mine, before she
had fully considered and provided for the consequence. 
The Ball-night being arrived, I dressed myself
in a suit I had reserved for some grand occasion; 
and having drank tea with Narcissa and her brother,
conducted my angel to the scene, where
she in a moment eclipsed all her female competitors
for beauty, and attracted the admiration
of the whole assembly. —My heart dilated with
pride on this occasion, and my triumph rejected
all bounds, when, after we had danced together,
a certain nobleman, remarkable for his figure and
influence in the beau monde, came up, and in
the hearing of all present, honoured us with a
very particular compliment, upon our accomplishments
and appearance;—but this transport
was soon checked, when I perceived his lordship
attach himself with great assiduity to my mistress; 
and say some warm things, which I thought, savoured
too much of passion. —It was then I began
to feel the pangs of jealousy—I dreaded the
power and address of my rival—I sickened at
his discourse; when she opened her lips to answer,
my heart died within me—when she
smiled, I felt the pains of the damned! —I was
enraged at his presumption; I cursed her complaisance!
when he quitted her and went to the
other side of the room. —Narcissa suspecting nothing
of the rage that inflamed me, put some
questions to me, as soon as he was gone, to
which I made no other reply than a grim look,
which too well denoted the agitation of my breast, 

and surprized her not a little. —She no sooner
observed my emotion, than she changed colour,
and asked what ailed me; but before I could
make answer, her brother pulling me by the
sleeve, bid me take notice of a lady who sat
fronting us, whom I immediately, to my vast
astonishment, distinguished to be Melinda, accompanied
by her mother and an elderly gentleman,
whom I did not know. —“Wounds! Mr.
Randan, (cried the Squire) is she not a delicate
piece of stuff? —'Sdeath! I have a good
mind—if I thought she was a single person.” 
—Notwithstanding the perplexity I was
in, I had reflection enough to foresee that my
passion might suffer greatly by the presence of
this lady, who in all probability would revenge
herself upon me for having formerly disgraced
her, by spreading reports to my prejudice. —I was
therefore alarmed at these symptoms of the
Squire's admiration; and for some time did not
know what reply to make, when he asked my
opinion of her beauty: At length I came to a
determination, and told him that her name was
Melinda, that she had a fortune of ten thousand
pounds, and was said to be under promise of
marriage to a certain lord, who deferred his nuptials,
until he should be of age, which would happen
in a few months: —I thought this piece of
intelligence, which I had myself invented, would
have hindered him effectually from entertaining
any further thoughts of her; but I was egregiously
mistaken: The fox-hunter had too
much self-sufficiency to despair of success with
any competitor on earth. He therefore made
light of her engagement, saying, with a smile
of self-approbation, “Mayhap she will change
her mind—what signifies his being a 

Lord? —I think myself as good a man as e'er a
Lord in christendom; and I'll see if a commoner
worth three thousand a year won't serve her
turn.” —This determination startled me not a
little; I knew he would soon discover the contrary
of what I advanced, and as I believed he
would find her ear open to his addresses, did not
doubt of meeting with every obstacle in my amour,
that her malice could invent, and her influence
with him execute. —This reflection
increased my chagrin—My vexation was evident
—Narcissa insisted on going home immediately; 
and as I led her to the door, her noble
admirer, with a look full of languishment, directed
to her a profound bow, which stung me
to the soul. —Before she went into the chair,
she asked, with an appearance of concern, what
was the matter with me? and I could pronounce
no more than, “By heaven! I'm distracted!”
