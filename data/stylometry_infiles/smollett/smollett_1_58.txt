In which his fortune is effectually strangled. 
The last resource, and that upon which he
least depended, was the advice and assistance
of his old friend the empirick, with whom
he still maintained a slight correspondence; 
and to whose house he steered his course, in
great perplexity and tribulation. That gentleman,
instead of consoling him with assurances
of friendship and protection, faithfully recapitulated
all the instances of his indiscretion and
misconduct, taxed him with want of sincerity
in the West-India affair, as well as with want
of honesty in this last marriage, while his former
wife was alive; and finally, reminded him
of his notes, which he desired might be immediately
taken up, as he (the quack) had present
occasion for a sum of money. 
Ferdinand seeing it would be impracticable
to derive any succour from this quarter, sneaked
homewards, in order to hold a consultation with
his own thoughts; and the first object that
presented itself to his eyes, when he entered his
apartment, was a letter from the tradesman,
with his account inclosed, amounting to fifty-five
pounds, which the writer desired might be
paid without delay. Before he had time to
peruse the articles, he received a summons, in
consequence of a bill of indictment for bigamy,
found against him in Hicks's-hall, by Sarah
Muddy, widow; and while he was revolving
measures to avert these storms, another billet
arrived from a certain attorney, giving him to
understand, that he had orders from doctor
Buffalo, the quack, to sue him for the payment 

of several notes, unless he would take them up
in three days from the date of this letter. 
Such a concurrence of sinister events, made
a deep impression upon the mind of our adventurer:
all his fortitude was insufficient to bear
him up against this torrent of misfortunes; his
resources were all dried up, his invention failed,
and his reflection began to take a new turn. 
“To what purpose (said he to himself) have I
deserted the paths of integrity and truth, and
exhausted a fruitful imagination, in contriving
schemes to betray my fellow creatures; if, instead
of acquiring a splendid fortune, which
was my aim, I have suffered such a series of
mortifications, and at last brought myself to
the brink of inevitable destruction? By a virtuous
exertion of those talents I inherit from
nature and education, I might, long before this
time, have rendered myself independent, and,
perhaps, conspicuous in life: I might have
grown up like a young oak, which being firmly
rooted in its kindred soil, gradually raises up
its lofty head, expands its leafy arms, projects
a noble shade, and towers the glory of the
plain; I should have paid the debt of gratitude
to my benefactors, and made their hearts sing
with joy for the happy effects of their benevolence; 
I should have been a bulwark to my
friends, a shelter to my neighbours in distress; 
I should have run the race of honour, seen
my fame diffused like a sweet-smelling odour, and
felt the ineffable pleasure of doing good; whereas
I am, after a vicissitude of disappointment,
dangers and fatigues, reduced to misery and
shame, aggravated by a conscience loaded with
treachery and guilt. I have abused the confidence
and generosity of my patron; I have defrauded 

his family under the mask of sincerity and
attachment; I have taken the most cruel and
base advantages of virtue in distress; I have
seduced unsuspecting innocence to ruin and
despair; I have violated the most sacred trust
reposed in me by my friend and benefactor; 
I have betrayed his love, torn his noble
heart asunder, by means of the most perfidious
slander and false insinuations; and finally,
brought to an untimely grave the fairest pattern
of human beauty and perfection. Shall
the author of these crimes pass with impunity? 
Shall he hope to prosper in the midst of such
enormous guilt? It were an imputation upon
providence to suppose it—Ah, no! I begin to
feel myself overtaken by the eternal justice of
heaven! I totter on the edge of wretchedness
and woe, without one friendly hand to save
me from the terrible abyss. 
These reflections, which, perhaps, the misery
of his fellow creatures would never have inspired,
had he himself remained without the
verge of misfortune, were now produced from
the sensation of his own calamities; and, for
the first time, his cheeks were bedewed with
the drops of penitence and sorrow. Contraries,
saith Plato, are productive of each other. 
Reformation is oftentimes generated from unsuccessful
vice; and our adventurer was, at
this juncture, very well disposed to turn over a
new leaf, in consequence of those salutary suggestions; 
though he was far from being cured
beyond the possibility of a relapse: on the contrary,
all the faculties of his soul were so well
adapted, and had been so long habituated to
deceit, that in order to extricate himself from
the evils that environed him, he would not, in 

all probability, have scrupled to practise it upon
his own father, had a convenient opportunity
occurred. 
Be that as it may, he certainly, after a tedious
and fruitless exercise of his invention, resolved
to effect a clandestine retreat from that
confederacy of enemies which he could not
withstand, and once more join his fortune to
that of Renaldo, whom he proposed to serve,
for the future, with fidelity and affection, thereby
endeavouring to attone for the treachery of
his former conduct. Thus determined, he
packed up his necessaries in a portmanteau, attempted
to amuse his creditors with promise of
speedy paymens, and venturing to come forth
in the dark, took a place in the Canterbury
stage-coach, after having converted his superfluities
into ready money. These steps were
not taken with such privacy, as to elude the
vigilance of his adversaries; for although he
had been cautious enough to transport himself
and his baggage to the inn on Sunday evening,
and never doubted, that the vehicle, which
set out at four o'clock on Monday morning,
would convey him out of the reach of his creditors,
before they could possibly obtain a writ
for securing his person; they had actually taken
such precautions as frustated all his finesse:
and the coach being stopt in the Borough of
Southwark, doctor Fathom was seized by virtue
of a warrant obtained on a criminal indictment
and was forthwith conducted to the prison of
the King's Bench: yet not before he had, by
his pathetic remonstrances, excited the compassion,
and even drawn tears from the eyes o
his fellow passengers. 
He no sooner recollected himself from the 

shock which must have been occasioned by this
sinister incident, than he dispatched a letter to
his brother-in-law the counsellor, requesting
an immediate conference, in which he promised
to make such a proposal as would save
him all the expence of a law suit and trial, and
at the same time effectually answer all the purposes
of both. He was accordingly favoured
with a suit from the lawyer, to whom, after the
most solemn protestations of his own innocence
he declared, that, finding himself unable to
wage war against such powerful antagonists,
he had resolved even to abandon his indubitable
right and retire into another country, in order
to screen himself from persecution, and remove
all cause of disquiet from the prosecutrix, when
he was unfortunately prevented by the warrant
which had been executed against him. He
said he was still willing, for the sake of his liberty,
to sign a formal renunciation of his pretensions
to Mrs. Fathom and her fortune, provided
the deeds could be executed, and the warrant
withdrawn, before he should be detained by
his other creditors; and lastly, he conjured the
barrister to spare himself the guilt and the
charge of suborning evidence for the destruction
of an unhappy man, whose misfortune was
his only fault. 
The lawyer felt the force of his expostulations,
and though he would by no means suppose
him innocent of the charge of bigamy,
yet under the pretext of humanity and commiseration,
he undertook to persuade his sister
to accept of a proper release, which he observed
would not be binding, if executed during
the confinement of Fathom; he therefore
took his leave in order to prepare the papers, 

withdraw the action, and take such other
measures as would hinder the prisoner
from giving him the slip. Next day he returned
with an order to release our hero, who being
formally discharged, was conducted; by
the lawyer, to a tavern in the neighbourhood,
where the releases were exchanged, and every
thing concluded with amity and concord. 
This business being happily transacted, Fathom
stept into an hackney coach with his
baggage, and was followed by a bailiff, who
told him, with great composure, that he was
again a prisoner at the suit of doctor Buffalo,
and desired the coachman to reconduct him to
the lodging he had so lately discharged. 
Fathom, whose fortitude had been hitherto
of the pagan temper, was now fain to reinforce
it with the philosophy of christian resignation,
tho' he had not as yet arrived to such
a pitch of self denial, as to forgive the counsellor,
to whose double dealing he imputed
this new calamity. After having received the
compliments of the jailor on his recommitment,
he took pen, ink, and paper, and composed
an artful and affecting epistle to the empirick,
imploring his mercy, flattering his
weakness, and demonstrating the bad policy of
cooping up an unhappy man in a jail, where
he could never have an opportunity of doing
justice to his creditors; nor did he forget to
declare his intention of retiring into another
country, where he might have some chance of
earning a subsistence, which he had so long
toiled for to no purpose in England. This last
declaration he made in consequence of the jealous
disposition of the quack, who, he knew,
had long looked upon him in the odious light 

of an interloping rival. However, he reaped
no benefit from this supplication, which served
only to gratify the pride of Buffalo, who
produced the extravagant encomiums which
Fathom had bestowed upon him, as so many
testimonials of his foe's bearing witness to his
virtue.
