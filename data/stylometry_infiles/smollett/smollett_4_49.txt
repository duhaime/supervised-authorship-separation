I enquire about my uncle, and understand he
is gone to sea—take lodgings at Charing-cross
—go to the play, where I meet
with an adventure—I go to an ordinary; 
the guests described—become acquainted
with Medlar and doctor Wagtail. 
As soon as we alighted at the Inn, I dispatched
Strap to enquire about my uncle, at
the Samson and Lion in Wapping; and he returned
in a little time, with an account of Mr.
Bowling's having gone to sea, mate of a merchant
ship, after a long and unsuccessful application
and attendance at the admiralty; where, it
seems, the interest he depended upon, was not
sufficient to reinstate him, or recover the pay that
was due to him when he quitted the Thunder. 
Next day I hired very handsome lodgings not
far from Charing-cross; and in the evening,
dressed myself in a plain suit of the true Paris cut,
and appeared in a front box at the play, where
I saw a good deal of company, and had vanity
enough to make me believe, that I was observed
with an uncommon degree of attention and applause. 
This silly conceit intoxicated me so much,
that I was guilty of a thousand ridiculous coquetries; 
and I dare say, how favourable soever
the thoughts of the company might be at my
first appearance, they were soon changed by my 

absurd behaviour, into pity or contempt. —I got
up and sat down, covered and uncovered my
head twenty times between the acts; pulled out
my watch, clapped it to my ear, wound it up,
set it, gave it the hearing again;—displayed my
snuff-box, affected to take snuff, that I might
have an opportunity of shewing my brilliant, and
wiped my nose with a perfumed handkerchief;— 
then dangled my cane, and adjusted my sword-knot,
and acted many more fooleries of the same
kind, in hopes of obtaining the character of a
pretty fellow, in the acquiring of which, I found
two considerable obstructions in my disposition; 
namely, a natural reserve, and jealous sensibility. — 
Fain would I have entered into conversation with
the people around me; but was restrained by the
fear of being censured for my assurance, as well
as by reflecting that I was more entitled to a
compliment of this kind from them than they to
such condescension from a stranger like me. — 
How often did I redden at the frequent whispers
and loud laughter of my fellow beaus, which I
imagined were excited by me! and how often
did I envy the happy indifference of those choice
spirits who beheld the distress of the scene, without
discovering the least symptom of approbation
or concern! My attention was engaged in spite
of myself, and I could not help weeping with
the heroine of the stage; though I practised a
great many shifts to conceal this impolite piece of
weakness. —When the play was ended, I sat
waiting for an opportunity of handing some lady
to her coach; but every one was attended by such
a number of officious gallants, that for a long time
I was baulked in my expectation. —At length,
however, I perceived a very handsome creature, 

genteelly dressed, sitting by herself in a box, at
some distance from me; upon which I went up
to her, and offered my service. —She seemed to
to be in some confusion, thanked me for my
complaisance, and with a tender look declined
giving me the trouble; looking at her watch, and
testifying her surprize at the negligence of her
footman, whom she had ordered to have a chair
ready for her at that hour. —I repeated my intreaty
with all the eloquence and compliment I
was master of; and in the event, she was prevailed
upon to accept of a proposal I made, to send
my servant for a chair or coach: Accordingly,
Strap was detached for that purpose, and returned
without success, there being none to be found; 
by this time the play-house was quite empty, and
we were obliged to retire: As I led her through
the passage, I observed five or six young fellows
of fashion, standing in a corner, one of whom,
as I thought, tipt my charmer the wink, and
when we were past, I heard them set up the loud
laugh. —This arroused my attention, and I was
resolved to be fully satisfied of this lady's character,
before I should have any nearer connexion
with her. —As no convenience appeared, I proposed,
that I should conduct her to a tavern,
where we might stay a few minutes, until my servant
could fetch a coach from the Strand. —She
seemed particularly shy of trusting herself in a tavern
with a stranger; but at last, yielded to my pathetic
remonstrances, rather than endanger her health,
by remaining in a cold damp thorough-fare. — 
Having thus far succeeded, I begged to know what
wine she would be pleased to drink a glass of; 
but she professed the greatest aversion to all sorts
of strong liquors; and it was with much difficulty 

that I could persuade her to eat a jelly. 
—In the mean time, I endeavoured to alleviate
the uneasiness she discovered, by saying all the
agreeable things I could think of; at which she
would often sigh, and regard me with a languishing
look, that seemed too near a-kin to the lewd
leer of a courtezan. —This discovery added to
my former suspicion, while it put me upon my
guard against her arts, divested me of reserve,
and enabled me to entertain her with more gaity
and freedom. —In the course of our conversation,
I pressed her to allow me the honour of waiting
upon her next day, at her lodgings, which she,
with many apologies, refused, lest it should give
umbrage to Sir John, who was of a disposition
apt to be fretted with trifles. —This information,
by which I was to understand that her husband was
a knight, did not check my addresses, which became
more and more importunate, and I was even
hardy enough to ravish a kiss. —But, O heavens!
instead of banqueting on the ambrosial flavour, that
her delicacy and complexion promised, I was almost
suffocated with the steams of Geneva! An
exhalation of this kind from a mouth which had
just before declared an utter abhorrence of all
spirituous liquors, not only changed my doubts
into certainty, but my raptures into loathing; 
and it would have been impossible for me to
have preserved common complaisance five minutes
longer, when my servant returned with a
coach. —I took the advantage of this occasion,
and presented my hand to the lady, who put in
practice against me the whole artillery of her
charms, ogling, languishing, sighing, and squeezing,
with so little reserve, that Strap perceived
her tenderness, and rubbed his hands with joy as 

he followed us to the door;—but I was proof against
all her endearments, and handed her into
the coach with an intention to take my leave immediately. 
She guessed my design, and invited
me to her house, whispering, that now Sir John
was gone to bed, she could have the pleasure of
my conversation for half an hour without interruption. 
—I told her, there was no mortification I
would not undergo, rather than endanger the repose
of her ladyship; and bidding the coachman
drive on, wished her a good night. —She lost all
temper at my indifference, and stopping the coach
at the distance of about twenty yards from me,
popped out her head, and bawled with the lungs
of a fish-woman, “D&wblank;n you, you dog, won't
you pay the coach-hire?” I made no answer: 
Upon which she held forth against me with an eloquence
peculiar to herself; calling me pitiful
fellow, scoundrel, and an hundred such appellations; 
and concluding with an oath, that for all
my appearance, she believed I had got no money
in my pocket. 
Having thus vented her indignation, she ordered
the coachman to proceed, and I returned
to the tavern, where I bespoke something for
supper, very well pleased at the issue of this adventure. 
—I dispensed with the attendance of the
waiter at table, on pretence that my own servant
was present, and when we were alone, said to
Strap; “Well, Monsieur d'Estrapes, what d'ye
think of this lady?” My friend, who had not
opened his mouth since her departure, could make
no other reply than the monosyllable “Think!” 
which he pronounced with a note of fear and
astonishment. —Surprized at this emphasis, I surveyed
my valet, and perceiving a wildness in 

his looks, asked if he had seen his grandfather's
ghost? —“Ghost! (said he) I am sure I have
seen a devil incarnate! Who would have
thought that so much devilish malice and Billingsgate,
could lurk under such sweetness of
countenance and modesty of behaviour? Ah!
God help us! Fronti nulla fides—nimium ne
crede colori—but we ought to down on our
knees and bless God for delivering us from
the jaws of that painted sepulchre.” —I was
pretty much of Strap's opinion, and though I did
not believe myself in any danger from the allurements
of that sisterhood, I determined to act
with great circumspection for the future, and shun
all commerce of that kind, as equally prejudicial
to my purse and constitution. 
My next care was to introduce myself into a
set of good acquaintance; for which purpose, I
frequented a certain coffee-house, noted for the
resort of good company, English as well as foreigners,
where my appearance procured all the
civilities and advances I could desire. There being
an ordinary in the same house, I went up
stairs to dinner with the other guests, and found
myself at table with thirteen people, the greatest
part of whom were better dressed than myself. 
—The conversation, which was mostly carried
on in French, turned chiefly on politicks; and I
soon found the whole company was in the French
interest, myself excepted, and a testy old gentleman,
who contradicted every thing that was advanced
in favour of his Most Christian Majesty,
with a surliness truly English. —But this trusty
patriot, who had never been out of his own
country, and drew all his maxims and notions
from prejudice and hearsay, was very unequal to 

his antagonists, who were superior to him in
learning and experience, and often took the liberty
of travellers, in asserting things which were
not strictly true, because they thought themselves
in no danger of being detected by him. —The
claim of the queen of Spain to the Austrian dominions
in Italy, was fully explained and vindicated,
by a person who sat opposite to me, and
by the solemnity of his manner, and the richness
of his apparel, seemed to be a foreign ambassador. 
—This dissertation introduced another on the
Pragmatic Sanction, handled with great warmth
by a young gentleman at my right hand, dressed
in a green frock trimmed with gold, who justified
the French king for his breach of that contract; 
and affirmed that he could not have observed it,
without injuring his own glory. —Although I was
not at all convinced by this gentleman's arguments,
I could not help admiring his vivacity,
which I imagined must be the effect of his illustrious
birth, and noble education, and accordingly
rated him in my conjecture as a young
prince on his travels. —The discourse was afterwards
shifted by an old gentleman of a very martial
appearance, to the last campaign, when the
battle of Dettingen was fought over again, with
so many circumstances to the honour of the
French, and disadvantage of the Allies, that I
began to entertain some doubts of my having
been there in person; and took the liberty to
mention some objections to what he advanced. — 
This introduced a dispute which lasted a good
while, to the mortification of all present; and
was at last referred to the determination of a
grave person, whom they stiled doctor, and who
under a shew of great moderation, decided it against 

me, with so little regard to truth, that I taxed
him with partiality in pretty severe terms, to the
no small entertainment of the true English politician,
who rejoiced at my defence of a cause he
had so often espoused without success: My oponent
pleased with the victory he had gained, affected
a great deal of candour, and told me, he
would not have been so positive, if he had not
been at great pains to inform himself of each particular
—“Indeed, (said he) I am convinced,
that, the previous steps considered, things
could not happen otherwise; for we generals
who have seen service, tho' we may not be on
the spot ourselves, know by the least sketch of
the disposition, what must be the event.” —He
then censured, with great freedom, every circumstance
of the conduct of those who commanded
the Allies; from thence made a transition to the
Ministry, which he honoured with many invectives,
for employing people who had neither experience
nor capacity, to the prejudice of old officers
who had been distinguished for both; dropt
many hints of his own importance; and concluded
with observing, that the French and
Spaniards knew better how to value generals of
merit; the good effects of which are seen in the
conquests they gain, and the admirable discipline
of their troops, which are at the same time better
cloathed and paid than any soldiers in the universe. 
These remarks furnished the green knight with an
opportunity of launching out in the praise of French
government in general, civil as well as military; 
on which occasion he made many odious comparisons
to the disadvantage of the English: Every
body, almost, assented to the observations he made,
and the doctor gave his sanction, by saying, the 

people in France were undoubtedly the happiest
subjects in the world. —I was so much astonished
and confounded at their infatuation and effrontery,
that I had not power to utter one word in
opposition to their assertions; but my morose associate
could not put up with the indignity that was
offered to old England, and therefore with a satirical
grin addressed himself to the general in these
words: “Sir, Sir, I have often heard it said,
She's a villainous bird that befouls her own nest. 
—As for what those people who are foreigners
say, I don't mind it, they know no better; 
but you who were bred and born, and have
got your bread under the English government,
should have more regard to gratitude as well
as truth, in censuring your native country. — 
If the ministry have thought fit to lay you
aside, I suppose they have their own reasons
for so doing; and you ought to remember
that you still live on the bounty of this nation. 
—As for these gentlemen, (meaning the prince
and ambassador) who make so free with our
constitution, laws and genius of our people, I
think they might shew a little more respect
for their benefactors, who, I must own, are
to blame in harbouring, protecting and encouraging
such ungrateful vagrants as they are.” 
—At these words the chevalier in green started up
in a great passion, and laying his hand on the
hilt of his hanger, exclaimed, “Ha! foutre!” 
—The Englishman on the other hand, grasping
his cane, cried, “Don't foutre me, sirrah, or
by G&wblank;d, I'll knock you down.” —The company
interposed, the Frenchman sat down again,
and his antagonist proceeded—“Lookee, monsieur,
you know very well, that had you 

dared to speak so freely of the administration
of your own country in Paris, as you have done
of ours in London, you would have been sent
to the Bastile without ceremony, where you
might have rotted in a dungeon, and never
seen the light of the sun again. —Now, Sir,
take my word for it, although our constitution
screens us from such oppression, we want not
laws to chastise the authors of seditious discourse; 
and if I hear another syllable out of
your mouth, in contempt or prejudice of this
kingdom, I will give you a convincing proof of
what I advance, and have you laid by the heels
for your presumption.” —This declaration had
an effect on the company, as sudden as surprizing. 
—The young prince became supple as a spaniel,
the ambassador trembled, the general sat silent
and abashed, and the doctor, who, it seems, had
felt the rod of power, grew pale as death, and assured
us all, that he had no intention to affront
any person or people. —“Your principles, doctor,
(resumed the old gentleman) are no secret
—I have nothing to say upon that head; but
am very much surprized, that a man who despises
us so much, should notwithstanding live
among us, when he has no visible motive for
so doing. —Why don't you take up your habitation
in your beloved France, where you
may rail at England without censure?” — 
To this the doctor thought proper to make no
reply; and an unsocial silence ensued; which I
perceiving, took notice, that it was pity such idle
disputes, maintained very often for whim or diversion,
should create any misunderstanding among
gentlemen of good sense; and proposed to drink
down all animosity in another bottle. —This motion 

was applauded by the whole company: The
wine was brought, and the English champion declaring
he had no spleen against any man for differing
in opinion from him, any more than for
difference of complexion, drank to the good
health of all present; the compliment was returned,
and the conversation once more became
unreserved, though more general than before. — 
Among other topicks, the subject of war was
introduced, on which the general declaimed with
great eloquence, recounting many of his own
exploits by way of illustration. —In the course of
his harrangue he happened to mention the word
epaulement, upon which the testy gentleman asked
the meaning of that term. —“I'll tell you what
an epaulement is, (replied he)—I never saw
an epaulement but once—and that was at the
siege of Namur—in a council of war, monsieur
Cohorn, the famous engineer, affirmed
that the place could not be taken.” —“Yes,
(said the prince of Vaudemont) it may be
taken by an epaulement.” —“This was immediately
put in execution, and in twenty-fourhours
Mareschal Boufflers was fain to capitulate.” — 
Here he made a full stop, and the old gentleman
repeated the question, “But pray what is an
epaulement?” —To this the officer made
no immediate reply, but rung the bell and called
for a bill, which being brought, he threw down
his proportion of the reckoning, and telling the
company, he would shew them what an epaulement
is, when his Majesty thought fit to entrust
him with the command of our army abroad,
strutted away with great dignity. —I could not
imagine why he was so shy of explaining one of
the most simple terms of fortification; which I 

forthwith described as a side-work composed of
earth, gabions, or faschins; but I was very much
surprized when I afterwards understood that his
reserve proceeded from his ignorance. —Having
paid our bill, we adjourned to the coffee-room,
where my fellow-labourer insisted on treating me
with a dish, giving me to understand at the same
time, that I had acquired his good opinion, both
with respect to my principles and intellects. — 
I thanked him for his compliment, and professing
myself an utter stranger in this part of the world,
begged he would have the goodness to inform
me of the quality and characters of the people
who dined above. —This request was a real favour
to one of his disposition, which was no less
communicative than curious; he therefore complied
with great satisfaction, and let me know, to my
extreme astonishment, that the supposed young
prince was a dancer at one of the theatres; and
the ambassador no other than a fidler belonging
to the opera. “The doctor (said he) is a Roman
Catholick priest, who sometimes appears
in the character of an officer, and assumes the
name of captain; but more generally takes the
garb, title and behaviour of a physician, in
which capacity he wheedles himself into the
confidence of weak-minded people, and by arguments
no less specious than false, converts
them from their religion and allegiance. —He
has been in the hands of justice more than
once for such practices; but he is a fly dog,
and manages matters with so much craft, that
hitherto he has escaped for a short imprisonment. 
—As for the general, you may see he
has owed his promotion more to his interest
than his capacity; and now that the eyes of 

the ministry are opened, his friends dead, or
become inconsiderable, he is struck off the
lift, and obliged to put up with a yearly pension; 
in consequence of this reduction, he is
become malecontent, and enveighs against the
government in all companies, with so little discretion,
that I am surprised at the lenity of
the administration in overlooking his insolence,
but the truth of the matter is, he owes his
safety to his weakness and want of importance. 
—He has seen a little, and but a little service,
and yet if you will take his word for it, there
has not been a great action performed in the
field since the revolution, in which he was not
principally concerned. When a story is told of
any great general, he immediately matches it
with one of himself, though he is often unhappy
in his invention, and commits such gross
blunders in the detail, that every body is in
pain for him. —Cæsar, Pompey, and Alexander
the Great are continually in his mouth; and as
he reads a good deal without any judgment to
digest it, his ideas are confused, and his harrangues
as unintelligible as infinite; for, once
he begins, there is no chance of his leaving
off speaking, while one person remains to
yield attention; therefore the only expedient
I know, of putting a stop to his loquacity,
is to lay hold of some incongruity he has uttered,
and demand an explanation; or ask
the meaning of some difficult term that he
knows by name only, this will effectually put
him to silence, if not to flight, as it happened
when I enquired about an epaulement. —Had he
been acquainted with the signification of that
word, his triumph would have been intolerable,
and we must have quitted the field first, or 

been worried with impertinence.” —Having
thus gratified my curiosity, the old gentleman began
to discover his own, in questions relating to
myself, to which I thought proper to return ambiguous
answers. —“I presume, Sir, (said he)
you have travelled.” —I answered, “Yes.” 
“—I dare say, you would find it very expensive
(said he.)” —I replied, “To be sure, one
cannot travel without money.” —“That I
know by experience (said he) for I myself
take a trip to Bath or Tunbridge every season; 
and one must pay sauce for what he has on
the road as well in other countries as in this. — 
That's a very pretty stone in your ring,—give
me leave, Sir,—the French have attained to a
wonderful skill in making compositions of this
kind. —Why now, this looks almost as well as a
diamond.” —“Almost as well, Sir, (said I) why
not altogether? —I'm sure if you understand
any thing of jewels, you must perceive at first
sight, that this stone is a real diamond, and
that of a very fine water. —Take it in your
hand, and examine it.” —He did so, with
some confusion, and returned it, saying, “I
ask your pardon, I see it is a true brilliant of immense
value.” —I imagined his respect for me
increased after this inquiry; therefore to captivate
his esteem the more, I told him, I would shew him
a seal of composition, engraved after a very valuable
antique; upon which I pulled out my
watch with a rich gold chain, adorned with three
seals set in gold, and an opal ring. —He viewed
each of them with great eagerness, handled the
chain, admired the chafed case, and observed
that the whole must have cost me a vast sum
of money. I affected indifference, and replied
in a careless manner, “Some trifle of sixty or 

seventy guineas.” Upon which he stared in
my face for some time, and then asked if I was
an Englishman. —I answered in the negative. — 
“You are from Ireland then, Sir, I presume,
(said he.)” I made the same reply. “O!
perhaps (said he) you was born in one of our
settlements abroad.” —I still answered no. — 
He seemed very much surprized, and said, he was
sure I was not a foreigner. I made no reply,
but left him upon the tenter-hooks of impatient
uncertainty. —He could not contain his anxiety,
but asked pardon for the liberties he had taken,
and to encourage me the more to disclose my situation,
display'd his own without reserve. — 
“I am (said he) a single man, have a considerable
annuity, on which I live according to
my own inclination; and make the ends of the
year meet very comfortably. —As I have no
estate to leave behind me, I am not troubled
with the importunate officiousness of relations, or
legacy hunters, and I consider the world as made
for me, not me for the world: It is my maxim
therefore to enjoy it while I can, and
let futurity shift for itself.” —While he thus
indulged his own talkative vein, and at the same
time, no doubt, expected a retaliation from me; 
a young man entered, dressed in black velvet and
an enormous tye-wig, with an air in which natural
levity and affected solemnity were so jumbled
together, that on the whole, he appeared
a burlesque on all decorum. This ridiculous
oddity danced up to the table at which we sat,
and after a thousand grimaces, asked my friend
by the name of Mr. Medlar, if we were not engaged
upon business. —My companion put on a
surly countenance, and replied, “No great business, 

doctor—but however.” —“O! then
(cried the physician) I must beg your indulgence
a little, pray pardon me, gentlemen. — 
Sir, (said he, addressing himself to me) your
most humble servant, I hope you will forgive
me, Sir—I must beg the favour to sit—Sir
—Sir—I have something of consequence to
impart to my friend Mr. Medlar—Sir, I hope
you will excuse my freedom in whispering,
Sir.” —Before I had time to give this complaisant
person my permission, Mr. Medlar cried,
“I'll have no whispering—if you have any
thing to say to me, speak with an audible
voice.” —The doctor seemed a little disconcerted
at this exclamation, and turning again to
me, making a thousand apologies for pretending
to make a mystery of any thing, which he said
was owing to his ignorance of my connexion
with Mr. Medlar; but now he understood I was
a friend, he would communicate what he had to
say, in my hearing. —He then began, after two
or three hems, in this manner: —“You must
know Sir, I am just come from dinner at my
lady Flareit's, (then addressing himself to me)
a lady of quality, Sir, at whose table I have
the honour of dining sometimes. —There was
lady Stately, and my lady Larum, and Mrs.
Dainty, and Miss Biddy Gigler, upon my
word, a very good natured young lady, with
a very pretty fortune, Sir. —There was also
my Lord Straddle, Sir John Shrug, and master
Billy Chatter, who is actually a very facetious
young gentleman. —So, Sir, her ladyship
seeing me excessively fatigued, for she
was the last of fifteen patients (people of distinction,
Sir) whom I had visited this forenoon, 

—insisted upon my staying dinner,— 
though upon my word, I protest I had no appetite:
however, in compliance with her
ladyship's request, Sir, I sat down, and the conversation
turning on different subjects, among
other things, Mr. Chatter asked very earnestly
when I saw Mr. Medlar. —I told him I had
not had the pleasure of seeing you these nineteen
hours and a half; for you may remember,
Sir, it was nearly about that time; I won't be
positive as to a minute.” —“No! (says he) then
I desire you will go to his lodgings immediately
after dinner, and see what is the matter with
him, for he must certainly be very bad from
having eat last night such a vast quantity of raw
oysters.” —The crusty gentleman, who from the
solemnity of his delivery, expected something extraordinary,
no sooner heard his conclusion, than
he started up in a testy humour, crying, “Pshaw,
pshaw! d&wblank;n your oysters;” and walked away
after a short compliment of “Your servant, Sir,” 
to me. —The doctor got up also, saying, “I
vow and protest, upon my word, I am actually
amazed.”—and followed Mr. Medlar to
the bar, which was hard by, where he was paying
for the coffee; there he whispered so loud
that I could over-hear, “Pray, who is this gentleman?” 
—His friend replied hastily, “I
might have known that before now, if it had
not been for your impertinent intrusion,”— 
and walked away very much disappointed. — 
The ceremonious physician returned immediately
and sat down by me, asking a thousand pardons
for leaving me alone; and giving me to understand
that what he had communicated to Mr.
Medlar at the bar was an affair of the last importance, 

that would admit of no delay. —He
then called for some coffee, and launched out into
the virtues of that berry, which, he said, in cold
phlegmatic constitutions, like his, dried up the
superfluous moisture, and braced the relaxed
nerves. —He let me know, that it was utterly
unknown to the ancients; and derived its
name from an Arabian word, which I might
easily perceive by the sound and termination. — 
From this topick he transferred his disquisitions to
the verb drink, which he affirmed, was improperly
applied to the taking of coffee, in as much
as people did not drink, but sip or sipple that liquour; 
—that the genuine meaning of drinking
is to quench one's thirst, or commit a debauch
by swallowing wine;—that the Latin word,
which conveyed the same idea, was bibere or
potare, and that of the Greeks pinein or poteein,
though he was apt to believe they were differently
used on different occasions: For example; 
to drink a vast quantity, or, as the vulgar express
it, to drink an ocean of liquor, was in Latin
potare, and in Greek poteein; and on the other
hand, to use it moderately, was bibere and pinein; 
—that this was only a conjecture of his own,
which, however, seemed to be supported by the
word bibulous, which is particularly applied to the
pores of the skin, that can only drink a very
small quantity of the circumambient moisture, by
reason of the smallness of their diameters;— 
whereas, from the verb poteein, is derived the
substantive potamos, which signifies a river, or
vast quantity of liquor. —I could not help smiling
at this learned and important investigation; and
to recommend myself the more to my new acquaintance,
whose disposition I was by this time 

well informed of, I observed, that what he alledged,
did not, to the best of my remembrance,
appear in the writings of the ancients; for, Horace
uses the words poto and bibo indifferently
for the same purpose, as in the twentieth Ode of
his first Book. 

Vile potabis modicis sabinum cantharis,—
—Et prælo domitam caleno tu bibes uvam.
That I had never heard of the verb poteein, but
that potamos, potema, and potos, were derived from
pino, poso, pepoka; in consequence of which, the
Greek poets never use any other word for festal
drinking. —Homer describes Nestor at his cups in
these words: 

Nestora d' ouk elathen jache pinonta perempes.
And Anacreon mentions it on the same occasion
almost in every page, 

Pionti d' oinon bedun
Otan pino ton oinon.
Opliz' eo de pino.
And in a thousand other places. —The doctor,
who, doubtless, intended by his criticism, to give
me an high idea of his erudition, was infinitely
surprized to find himself schooled by one in my
appearance; and after a considerable pause, cried,
“Upon my word! you are in the right, Sir. — 
I find I have not considered this affair with
my usual accuracy.” —Then accosting me, in
Latin, which he spoke very well, the conversation
was maintained full two hours, on a variety
of subjects, in that language; and indeed, he
spoke so judiciously, that I was convinced, notwithstanding
his whimsical appearance, and attention 

to trifles, of his being a man of extensive
knowledge, especially in books; he looked upon
upon me, as I afterwards understood from Mr.
Medlar, as a prodigy in learning, and proposed
that very night, if I was not engaged, to introduce
me to several young gentlemen of fortune
and fashion, with whom he had an appointment
at the Bedford coffee-house.
