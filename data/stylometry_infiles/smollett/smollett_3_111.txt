The young gentleman is introduced to a virtuoso
of the first order, and commences Yelper. 
Hitherto Peregrine had professed himself an
author, without reaping the fruits of that
occupation, except the little fame he had acquired
by his late satire; but now he thought it high
time to weigh solid pudding against empty praise; 

and therefore engaged with some booksellers in a
certain translation, which he obliged himself to
perform for the consideration of two hundred
pounds. The articles of agreement being drawn,
he began his task with great eagerness, rose early
in the morning to his work, at which he laboured
all day long, went abroad with the bats in the
evening, and appeared in the coffee-house, where
he amused himself with the news-papers and
conversation till nine o'clock; then he retired to
his own apartment, and after a slight repast, betook
himself to rest, that he might be able to
unroost with the cock. This sudden change
from his former way of life agreed so ill with his
disposition, that, for the first time, he was troubled
with flatulencies and indigestion, which produced
anxiety and dejection of spirits, and the
nature of his situation began in some measure to
discompose his brain; a discovery which he no
sooner made, than he had recourse to the advice
of a young physician, who was a member of
the college, and at this time one of our hero's
most intimate acquaintance. 
This son of Æsculapius having considered his
case, imputed his disorder to the right cause,
namely, want of exercise; dissuaded him from
such close application to study, until he should
be gradually familiarized to a sedentary life, advised
him to enjoy his friend and his bottle in moderation,
and wean himself from his former customs
by degrees; and, above all things, to rise
immediately after his first sleep, and exercise himself
in a morning-walk. In order to render this
last part of the prescription the more palatable,
the doctor promised to attend him in these early
excursions, and even to introduce him to a certain 

personage of note, who gave a sort of public
breakfasting to the minor virtuosi of the age,
and often employed his interest in behalf of those
who properly cultivated his countenance and approbation. 
This proposal was extremely acceptable to our
young gentleman, who, besides the advantage
which might accrue to him from such a valuable
connexion, foresaw much entertainment and satisfaction
in the discourse of so many learned
guests. The occasions of his health and interest,
moreover, coincided in another circumstance,
the minister's levee being kept betimes in
the morning; so that he could perform his walk,
yield his attendance, and breakfast at this philosophical
board, without incroaching a great deal
upon his other avocations. 
Measures being thus preconcerted, the physician
conducted our adventurer to the house of
this celebrated sage, to whom he recommended
him as a gentleman of genius and taste, who
craved the honour of his acquaintance; but he
had previously smoothed the way to this introduction,
by representing Peregrine as a young
fellow of great ambition, spirit and address, who
could not fail to make a figure in the world; 
that, therefore, he would be a creditable addition
to the subordinates of such a patron, and by
his qualifications, intrepidity and warmth of temper,
turn out a consummate herald of his fame. 
Upon these considerations, he met with a most
engaging reception from the entertainer, who
was a well-bred man, of some learning, generosity
and taste; but his foible was the desire of
being thought the inimitable pattern of all three. 

It was with a view to acquire and support this
character, that his house was open to all those
who had any pretensions to literature; consequently
he was surrounded by a strange variety
of pretenders; but none were discouraged, because
he knew that even the most insignificant
might, in some shape, conduce to the propagation
of his praise. A babbler, tho' he cannot run
upon the scent, may spring the game, and by his
yelping help to fill up the cry: no wonder then,
that a youth of Pickle's accomplishments was admitted
and even invited into the pack. After
having enjoyed a very short private audience in
the closet, our young gentleman was shewn into
another room, where half a dozen of his fellow-adherents
waited for their Mæcenas, who in a
few minutes appeared, with a most gracious aspect,
received the compliments of the morning,
and sat down to breakfast, in the midst of them,
without any further ceremony. 
The conversation at first turned upon the weather,
which was investigated in a very philosophical
manner by one of the company, who
seemed to have consulted all the barometers and
thermometers that ever were invented, before
he would venture to affirm that it was a chill
morning. This subject being accurately discussed,
the chief inquired about the news of the learned
world; and his inclination was no sooner expressed
than every guest opened his mouth, in order
to gratify his curiosity: but he that first captivated
his attention was a meager, shrivelled antiquary,
who looked like an animated mummy,
which had been scorched among the sands of the
desert. He told the patron, that he had by accident
met with a medal, which, tho' it was defaced 

by time, he would venture to pronounce a
genuine antique, from the ringing and taste of the
metal, as well as from the colour and composition
of the rust: so saying, he produced a piece
of copper coin, so consumed and disguised by age,
that scarce a vestige of the impression was to be
perceived. Nevertheless this connoisseur pretended
to distinguish a face in profil, from which
he concluded that the piece was of the Upper empire,
and on the reverse he endeavoured to point
out the bulb of the spear, and part of the parazonium,
which were the insignia of the Roman Virtus,
together with the fragment of one fold of
the multicium in which she was cloathed. He likewise
had discovered one angle of the letter N, and,
at some distance, an intire I: from these circumstances
conjecturing, and indeed concluding,
that the medal was struck by Severus, in honour
of the victory he obtained over his rival Niger,
after he had forced the passes of mount Taurus. 
This criticism seemed very satisfactory to the entertainer,
who having examined the coin by the
help of his spectacles, plainly discerned the particulars
which the owner had mentioned, and was
pleased to term his account of the matter a very
ingenious explanation. 
The curiosity was circulated through the hands
of all present, and every virtuoso, in his turn,
licked the copper, and rung it upon the hearth,
declaring his assent to the judgment which had
been pronounced. At length, it fell under the inspection
of our young gentleman, who, tho' no
antiquarian, was very well acquainted with the
current coin of his own country, and no sooner
cast his eyes upon this valuable antique, than he
affirmed, without hesitation, that it was no other 

than the ruins of an English farthing, and that
same spear, parazonium, and multicium, the remains
of the emblems and drapery with which the
figure of Britannia is delineated on our copper-money. 
This hardy asseveration seemed to disconcert
the patron, while it incensed the medallist, who
grinning like an enraged baboon, “What d'ye
tell me of a brass farthing? (said he) Did you
ever know modern brass of such a relish? Do but
taste it, young gentleman; and sure I am, if you
have ever been conversant with subjects of this kind,
you will find as wide a difference in the favour between
this and an English farthing, as can possibly
be perceived betwixt an onion and a turnip:
besides, this medal has the true Corinthian
ring; then the attitude is upright, whereas that
of Britannia is reclining; and how is it possible
to mistake a branch of palm for a parazonium?” 
All the rest of the company espoused the virtuoso's
side of the question, because the reputation
of each was concerned; and the patron finding
himself in the same predicament, assumed a solemnity
of feature, dashed with a small mixture
of displeasure, and told Peregrine, that as he had
not made that branch of literature his particular
study, he was not surprised to see him mistaken
in his opinion. Pickle immediately understood
the reproof; and tho' he was shocked at the vanity
or infatuation of his entertainer and fellow-guests,
asked pardon for his presumption, which
was accordingly excused, in consideration of his
inexperience; and the English farthing dignified
with the title of a true antique. 
The next person that addressed himself to the
chief was a gentleman of a very mathematical 

turn, who valued himself upon the improvements
he had made in several domestic machines, and
now presented the plan of a new contrivance for
cutting cabbages, in such a manner as would secure
the stock against the rotting rain, and enable
it to produce a plenteous after-crop of delicious
sprouts. In this important machine he had united
the whole mechanic powers, with such massy
complication of iron and wood, that it could not
have been moved without the assistance of an
horse, and a road made for the convenience of
the draught. These objections were so obvious,
that they occurred at first sight to the inspector-general,
who greatly commended the invention,
which, he observed, might be applied to several
other useful purposes, could it once be rendered
a little more portable and commodious. 
The inventor, who had not foreseen these
difficulties, was not prepared to surmount them; 
but he took the hint in good part, and promised
to task his abilities anew, in altering the constitution
of his design. Not but that he underwent
some severe irony from the rest of the virtuosi,
who complimented him upon the momentous improvement
he had made, by which a family
might save a dish of greens in a quarter, for so
trifling an expence as that of purchasing, working
and maintaining such a stupendous machine:
but no man was more sarcastic in his remarks
upon this piece of mechanism than the naturalist,
who next appealed to the patron's approbation
for a curious disquisition he had made, touching
the procreation of muck flies, in which he had
laid down a curious method of collecting, preserving
and hatching the eggs of these insects,
even in the winter, by certain modifications of 

artificial heat. The nature of this discovery was
no sooner communicated, than Peregrine, unable
to contain himself, burst into a fit of laughter,
which infected every person at the table, the
landlord himself not excepted, who found it impossible
to preserve his wonted gravity of face. 
Such unmannerly mirth did not fail to mortify
the philosopher, who, after some pause, during
which indignation and disdain were painted in his
countenance, reprehended our young gentleman
for his unphilosophical behaviour, and undertook
to prove, that the subject of his inquiry was of infinite
consequence to the progress and increase of
natural knowledge: but he found no quarter
from the vengeful engineer, who now retorted
his ironical compliments, with great emphasis,
upon this hot-bed for the generation of vermin,
and advised him to lay the whole process before
the Royal Society, which would, doubtless, present
him with a medal, and give him a place
among their memoirs, as a distinguished promoter
of the useful arts. If (said he) you had
employed your studies in finding out some effectual
method to destroy those insects which
prejudice and annoy mankind, in all probability
you must have been contented with the contemplation
of the good you had done; but this curious
expedient for multiplying maggots, will
surely intitle you to an honourable rank in the
list of learned philosophers.” “I don't wonder
(replied the naturalist) that you should be so
much adverse to the propagation of insects, because,
in all likelihood, you are afraid that they
will not leave you a cabbage to cut down with
that same miraculous machine.” “Sir (answered
the mechanic, with great bitterness of voice and 

aspect) if the cabbage be as light-headed as some
muck-worm philosophers, it will not be worth
cutting down.” “I never dispute upon cabbage
with the son of a cucumber,” said the fly-breeder,
alluding to the pedigree of his antagonist; 
who, impatient of the affront, started up
with fury in his looks, exclaiming, “'Sdeath!
meaning me, Sir?” 
Here the patron, perceiving things drawing
towards a rupture, interposed his authority, rebuking
them for their intemperance, and recommending
to them amity and concord against the
Goths and Vandals of the age, who took all
opportunities of ridiculing and discouraging the
adherents of knowledge and philosophy. After
this exhortation, they had no pretence for carrying
on the dispute, which was dropt, in all appearance,
tho' the mechanick still retained his
resentment; and after breakfast, when the company
broke up, accosted his adversary in the
street, desiring to know how he durst be so insolent
as to make that scurrilous reflection upon
his family: the fly-fancier, thus questioned, accused
the mathematician of having been the aggressor,
in likening his head to a light cabbage; 
and here the altercation being renewed, the
engineer proceeded to the illustration of his mechanicks,
tilting up his hand like a ballance,
thrusting it forward by way of lever, embracing
the naturalist's nose like a wedge betwixt two of
his fingers, and turning it round, with the momentum
of a screw or peritrochium. Had they
been obliged to decide the dispute, with equal
arms, the assailant would have had a great advantage
over the other, who was very much his inferior
in muscular strength; but the philosopher, 

being luckily provided with a cane, no sooner
disengaged himself from this opprobrious application,
than he handled his weapon with great
dexterity about the head and shoulders of his
antagonist, who, finding this shower of blows
very disagreeable, was fain to betake himself to
his heels for shelter, and was pursued by the
angry victor, who chased him from one end of
the street to the other, affording unspeakable satisfaction
to the multitude, as well as to our hero
and his introductor, who were spectators of the
whole scene. 
Thus was our adventurer initiated in the society
of Yelpers, tho' he did not as yet fully understand
the nature of his office, which was explained
by the young physician, who chid him
for his blunt behaviour in the case of the medal; 
and gave him to understand, that their patron's
favour was neither to be gained, nor preserved by
any man that would pretend to convict him of a
mistake: he therefore counselled him to respect
this foible, and cultivate the old gentleman with
all the zeal and veneration, which a regard to his
own character would permit him to pay. This
task was the easier to one of our young gentleman's
pliant disposition, because the virtuoso's
behaviour was absolutely free from that insolent
self-conceit, which he could not bear without
disgust: the senior was, on the contrary, mild
and beneficent; and Pickle was rather pleased
than shocked at this weakness, because it flattered
his vanity with the supposition of his own
superior sense. 
Cautioned in this manner, Peregrine profited
so much by his insinuating qualifications, that, in
a very little time, he was looked upon as one of 

the chief favourites of the patron, to whom he
dedicated a small occasional poem; and every
body believed he would reap the fruits of his
attachment, among the first of the old gentleman's
dependants.
