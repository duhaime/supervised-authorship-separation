The doctor prepares an entertainment in the manner
of the ancients, which is attended with divers
ridiculous circumstances. 
In a word, our young gentleman, by his insinuating
behaviour, obtained the full confidence
of the doctor, who invited him to an entertainment,
which he intended to prepare in the
manner of the ancients. Pickle, struck with
this idea, eagerly embraced the proposal, which
he honoured with many encomiums, as a plan
in all respects worthy of his genius and apprehension; 
and the day was appointed at some distance
of time, that the treater might have leisure
to compose certain pickles and confections
which were not to be found among the culinary
preparations of these degenerate days. 
With a view of rendering the physician's taste
more conspicuous, and extracting from it the
more diversion, Peregrine proposed that some foreigners
should partake of the banquet; and the
task being left to his care and discretion, he actually
bespoke the company of a French marquis,
an Italian count and a German baron, whom he
knew to be egregious coxcombs, and therefore
more likely to enhance the joy of the entertainment. 
Accordingly, the hour being arrived, he conducted
them to the hotel where the physician
lodged, after having regaled their expectations with
an elegant meal in the genuine old Roman taste; 
and they were received by Mr. Pallet, who did
the honours of the house, while his friend superintended 

the rotisseur below. By this communicative
painter, the guests understood that the doctor
had met with numerous difficulties in the execution
of his design; that no fewer than five cooks had been
dismissed, because they could not prevail upon
their own consciences to obey his directions in
things that were contrary to the present practice
of their art; and that although he had at last engaged
a person, by an extraordinary premium,
to comply with his orders, the fellow was so
astonished, mortified and incensed at the commands
he had received, that his hair stood on
end, and he begged on his knees, to be released
from the agreement he had made: but finding
that his employer insisted upon the performance
of his contract, and threatened to introduce him
to the commissaire, if he should flinch from the
bargain, he had, in the discharge of his office,
wept, sung, cursed and capered for two whole
hours without intermission; so that his brain
seemed to have received a rude shock, and, in
all probability, he would never be his own man
again. 
While the company listened to this odd information,
by which they were prepossessed with
strange notions of the dinner, their ears were
invaded by a piteous voice that exclaimed in
French, “For the love of God! dear Sir! for
the passion of Jesus Christ! spare me the mortification
of the honey and oil!” But this pathetic
supplication having no effect upon the
physician, who in all likelihood poured in, with
his own hand, the sauce against which the cook
had objected, the same voice was heard to utter
a sort of yell, which was followed by a string of
execrations in the French language, that gradually 

died away, as if the swearer had been forcibly
conveyed into a more distant apartment. 
Their ears still vibrated with the sound, when
the doctor entering, was by Peregrine made acquainted
with the strangers, to whom he, in the
transports of his wrath, could not help of complaining
of the want of complaisance he had found
in the Parisian vulgar, by which his plan had
been almost entirely ruined and set aside. The
French marquis, who thought the honour of his
nation was concerned at this declaration, professed
his sorrow for what had happened, so contrary
to the established character of the people,
and undertook to see the delinquents severely punished,
provided he could be informed of their
names or places of abode. The mutual compliments
that passed on this occasion were scarce
finished, when a servant coming into the room,
announced dinner; and the entertainer led the
way into another apartment, where they found
a long table, or rather two boards joined together,
and furnished with a variety of dishes, the
steams of which had such evident effect upon the
nerves of the company, that the marquis made
frightful grimaces, under pretence of taking snuff; 
the Italian's eyes watered, the German's visage
underwent violent distortion of features; our hero
found means to exclude the odour from his sense
of smelling, by breathing only through his mouth; 
and the poor painter running into another room,
plugged his nostrils with tobacco. The doctor
himself, who was the only person then present
whose organs were not discomposed, pointing to
a couple of couches placed on each side of the
table, told his guests, that he was sorry he could
not procure the exact triclinia of the ancients, 

which were somewhat different from these conveniencies,
and desired they would have the goodness
to repose themselves without ceremony, each
in his respective couchette, while he and his
friend Mr. Pallet would place themselves upright
at the ends, that they might have the pleasure of
serving those that lay along. This disposition,
of which the strangers had no previous idea, disconcerted
and perplexed them in a most ridiculous
manner; the marquis and baron stood bowing
to each other, on pretence of disputing the
lower seat, but in reality with a view of profiting
by the example of one another, for neither of
them understood the manner in which they were
to loll; and Peregrine, who enjoyed their confusion,
handed the count to the other side, where,
with the most mischievous politeness, he insisted
upon his taking possession of the upper place. 
In this disagreeable and ludicrous suspence they
continued acting a pantomime of gesticulations,
until the doctor earnestly intreated them to wave
all compliment and form, lest the dinner should
be spoiled before the ceremonial could be adjusted. 
Thus conjured, Peregrine took the lower
couch on the left-hand side, laying himself gently
down, with his face towards the table. The
marquis, in imitation of this pattern (though he
would have much rather fasted three days than
run the risk of discomposing his dress by such an
attitude) stretched himself upon the opposite place,
reclining upon his elbow in a most painful and
aukward situation, with his head raised above the
end of the couch, that the œconomy of his hair
might not suffer by the projection of his body. 
The Italian being a thin, limber creature, planted
himself next to Pickle, without sustaining any 

misfortune, but that of his stocking being torn
by a ragged nail of the seat, as he raised his legs
on a level with the rest of his limbs. But the
baron, who was neither so wieldy nor supple in
his joints as his companions, flounced himself
down with such precipitation, that his feet suddenly
tilting up, came in furious contact with
the head of the marquis, and demolished every
curl in a twinkling, while his own skull, at the
same instant, descended upon the side of his couch
with such violence, that his periwig was struck
off, and the whole room filled with pulvilio. 
The drollery of distress that attended this disaster
entirely vanquished the affected gravity of
our young gentleman, who was obliged to suppress
his laughter by cramming his handkerchief
in his mouth; for the bare-headed German asked
pardon with such ridiculous confusion, and the
marquis admitted his apology with such rueful
complaisance, as were sufficient to awake the
mirth of a quietist, whose insensibility was not
utterly extinguished. 
This misfortune being repaired as well as the
circumstances of the occasion would permit, and
every one settled according to the arrangement
already described, the doctor graciously undertook
to give some account of the dishes as they
occurred, that the company might be directed in
their choice; and with an air of infinite satisfaction
thus began: “This here, gentlemen, is
a boiled goose, served up in a sauce composed of
pepper, lovage, coriander, mint, rue, anchovies
and oil; I wish for your sakes, gentlemen, it
was one of the geese of Ferrara, so much celebrated
among the ancients for the magnitude of
their livers, one of which is said to have weighed 

upwards of two pounds: with this food, exquisite
as it was, did the tyrant Heliogabalus regale his
hounds. But I beg pardon, I had almost forgot
the soup, which I hear is so necessary an article
at all tables in France. At each end there
are dishes of the salacacabia of the Romans, one
is made of parsley, pennyroyal, cheese, pine-tops,
honey, vinegar, brine, eggs, cucumbers,
onions and hen livers; the other is much the
same as the soup-maigre of this country. Then
there is a loin of veal boiled with fennel and caraway-seed,
on a pottage composed of pickle,
oil, honey and flour, and a curious hachis of the
lights, liver and blood of an hare, together with
a dish of roasted pigeons. Monsieur le baron,
shall I help you to a plate of this soup?” The
German, who did not at all disapprove of the ingredients,
assented to the proposal, and seemed
to relish the composition; while the marquis, being
asked by the painter which of the silly-kickabys
he chose, was in consequence of his desire
accommodated with a portion of the soup
maigre; and the count, in lieu of spoon-meat, of
which he said he was no great admirer, supplied
himself with a pigeon, therein conforming to
the choice of our young gentleman, whose example
he determined to follow through the whole
course of the entertainment. 
The Frenchman having swallowed the first
spoonful, made a full pause, his throat swelled,
as if an egg had stuck in his gullet, his eyes
rolled, and his mouth underwent a series of involuntary
contractions and dilatations. Pallet,
who looked stedfastly at this connoisseur, with a
view of consulting his taste, before he himself
would venture upon the soup, began to be disturbed 

at these emotions, and observed with
some concern, that the poor gentleman seemed to
be going into a fit; when Peregrine assured him
that these were symptoms of extasy, and for further
confirmation, asked the marquis how he
found the soup. It was with infinite difficulty
that his complaisance could so far master his disgust,
as to enable him to answer, “Altogether
excellent, upon my honour!” And the painter
being certified of his approbation, lifted the spoon
to his mouth without scruple; but, far from
justifying the elogium of his taster, when this
precious composition diffused itself upon his palate,
he seemed to be deprived of all sense and
motion, and sat like the leaden statue of some
river god, with the liquor flowing out at both
sides of his mouth. 
The doctor, alarmed at this indecent phænomenon,
earnestly inquired into the cause of it; 
and when Pallet recovered his recollection, and
swore that he would rather swallow porridge made
of burning brimstone, than such an infernal mess
as that which he had tasted, the physician, in his
own vindication, assured the company, that, except
the usual ingredients, he had mixed nothing
in the soup but some sal armoniac instead of the
ancient nitrum, which could not now be procured; 
and appealed to the marquis, whether
such a succedaneum was not an improvement on
the whole. The unfortunate petit maitre, driven
to the extremity of his condescension, acknowledged
it to be a masterly refinement; and
deeming himself obliged, in point of honour, to
evince his sentiments by his practice, forced a
few more mouthfuls of this disagreeable potion
down his throat, till his stomach was so much 

offended, that he was compelled to start up of a
sudden, and in the hurry of his elevation overturned
his plate into the bosom of the baron. 
The emergency of his occasions would not permit
him to stay and make apologies for this abrupt
behaviour, so that he flew into another apartment,
where Pickle found him puking, and
crossing himself with great devotion; and a chair,
at his desire, being brought to the door, he slipt
into it more dead than alive, conjuring his friend
Pickle to make his peace with the company, and
in particular excuse him to the baron, on account
of the violent fit of illness with which he had
been seized. It was not without reason that he
employed a mediator; for when our hero returned
to the dining-room, the German got up,
and was under the hands of his own lacquey,
who wiped the grease from a rich embroidered
waistcoat, while he, almost frantic with his misfortune,
stamped upon the ground, and in High
Dutch cursed the unlucky banquet, and the impertinent
entertainer, who all this time, with
great deliberation, consoled him for the disaster,
by assuring him, that the damage might be repaired
with some oil of turpentine and an hot
iron. Peregrine, who could scarce refrain from
laughing in his face, appeased his indignation,
by telling him how much the whole company,
and especially the marquis, was mortified at the
accident; and the unhappy salacacabia being removed,
the places were filled with two pies,
one of dormice liquored with syrup of white poppies,
which the doctor had substituted in the room
of toasted poppy-seed, formerly eaten with honey,
as a desert; and the other composed of an
hock of pork baked in honey. 

Pallet hearing the first of these dishes described,
lifted up his hands and eyes, and with signs of
loathing and amazement pronounced, “A pye
made of dormice and syrup of poppies; Christ
in heaven! what beastly fellows these Romans
were!” His friend checked him for his irreverent
exclamation with a severe look, and recommended
the veal, of which he himself chearfully
ate, with such encomiums to the company,
that the baron resolved to imitate his example,
after having called for a bumper of Burgundy,
which the physician, for his sake, wished to have
been the true wine of Falernum. The painter
seeing nothing else upon the table which he would
venture to touch, made a merit of necessity, and
had recourse to the veal also; although he could
not help saying, that he would not give one slice of
the roast beef of old England for all the dainties of
a Roman emperor's table. But all the doctor's invitations
and assurances could not prevail upon his
guests to honour the hachis and the goose; and
that course was succeeded by another, in which
he told them were divers of those dishes, which
among the antients had obtained the appellation
of politeles, or magnificent. “That which smoaks
in the middle (said he) is a sow's stomach, filled
with a composition of minced pork, hog's brains,
eggs, pepper, cloves, garlick, anniseed, rue, ginger,
oil, wine and pickle. On the right hand
side are the teats and belly of a sow, just farrowed,
fried with sweet wine, oil, flour, lovage
and pepper. On the left is a fricassee of snails,
fed, or rather purged with milk. At that end
next Mr. Pallet are fritters of pompions, lovage,
origanum and oil; and here are a couple of pullets, 

roasted and stuffed in the manner of Apicius. 
The painter, who had by wry faces, testify'd
his abhorrence of the sow's stomach,
which he compared to a bagpipe, and the snails
which had undergone purgation, no sooner heard
him mention the roasted pullets, than he eagerly
sollicited a wing of the fowl; upon which the
doctor desired he would take the trouble of cutting
them up, and accordingly sent them round,
while Mr. Pallet tucked the table-cloth under
his chin, and brandished his knife and fork with
singular address: but scarce were they set down
before him, when the tears ran down his cheeks,
and he called aloud, in manifest disorder, “Z&wblank;ds!
this is the essence of a whole bed of garlic!” 
That he might not, however, disappoint or disgrace
the entertainer, he applied his instruments
to one of the birds, and when he opened up the
cavity, was assaulted by such an irruption of intolerable
smells, that without staying to disengage
himself from the cloth, he sprung away,
with an exclamation of, “Lord Jesus!” and
involved the whole table in havock, ruin and
confusion. 
Before Pickle could accomplish his escape, he
was sauced with the syrup of the dormouse pye,
which went to pieces in the general wreck; and
as for the Italian count, he was overwhelmed by
the sow's stomach, which bursting in the fall,
discharged its contents upon his leg and thigh,
and scalded him so miserably, that he shrieked
with anguish, and grinned with a most ghastly
and horrible aspect. 
The baron, who sat secure without the vortex
of this tumult, was not at all displeased at seeing 

his companions involved in such a calamity as
that which he had already shared; but the doctor
was confounded with shame and vexation. After
having prescribed an application of oil to the
count's leg, he expressed his sorrow for the misadventure,
which he openly ascribed to want
of taste and prudence in the painter, who did not
think proper to return, and make an apology in
person; and protested, that there was nothing in
the fowls which could give offence to a sensible
nose, the stuffing being a mixture of pepper,
lovage and assa fœtida, and the sauce consisting
of wine and herring-pickle, which he had used
instead of the celebrated garum of the Romans; 
that famous pickle having been prepared sometimes
of the scombri, which were a sort of tunny
fish, and sometimes of the silurus, or shad-fish:
nay, he observed that there was a third kind,
called garum hæmation, made of the guts, gills
and blood of the thynnus. 
The physician, finding it would be impracticable
to re-establish the order of the banquet, by
presenting again the dishes which had been discomposed,
ordered every thing to be removed, a
clean cloth to be laid, and the desert to be
brought in. 
Mean while, he regretted his incapacity to
give them a specimen of the alieus, or fish meals
of the ancients, such as the jus diabaton, the
conger-eel, which in Galen's opinion is hard of
digestion, the cornuta, or gurnard, described by
Pliny in his Natural History, who says, the horns
of many of them were a foot and a half in
length; the mullet and lamprey, that were in
the highest estimation of old, of which last Julius
Cæsar borrowed six thousand for one triumphal 

supper. He observed, that the manner of dressing
them was described by Horace, in the account
he gives of the entertainment to which
Mæcenas was invited by the epicure Nasiedenus: 

Affertur squillas inter Murena natantes, &c.
And told them, that they were commonly eaten
with the rhus syriacum, a certain anodyne and
astringent seed, which qualified the purgative nature
of the fish. Finally, this learned physician
gave them to understand, that though this was
reckoned a luxurious dish in the zenith of the
Roman taste, it was by no means comparable, in
point of expence, to some preparations in vogue
about the time of that absurd voluptuary Heliogabalus,
who ordered the brains of six hundred
ostriches to be compounded in one mess. 
By this time the desert appeared, and the company
were not a little rejoiced to see plain olives
in salt and water: but what the master of the
feast valued himself upon, was a sort of jelly,
which he affirmed to be preferable to the hypotrimma
of Hesychius, being a mixture of vinegar,
pickle and honey, boiled to a proper consistence,
and candied assa fœtida, which he asserted,
in contradiction to Humelbergius and
Lister, was no other than the laser syriacum, so
precious, as to be sold among the ancients to the
weight of a silver penny. The gentlemen took
his word for the excellency of this gum, but contented
themselves with the olives, which gave
such an agreeable relish to the wine, that they
seemed very well disposed to console themselves
for the disgraces they had endured; and Pickle, 

unwilling to lose the least circumstance of entertainment
that could be enjoyed in their company,
went in quest of the painter, who remained in
his penitentials in another apartment, and could
not be persuaded to re-enter the banqueting-room,
until Peregrine undertook to procure his
pardon from those whom he had injured. Having
assured him of this indulgence, our young gentleman
led him in like a criminal, bowing on
all hands with an air of humility and contrition; 
and particularly addressing himself to the count,
to whom he swore in English, as God was his
saviour, he had no intent to affront man, woman,
or child; but was fain to make the best
of his way, that he might not give the honourable
company cause of offence, by obeying the
dictates of nature in their presence. 
When Pickle interpreted this apology to the
Italian, Pallet was forgiven in very polite terms,
and even received into favour by his friend the
doctor, in consequence of our hero's intercession:
so that all the guests forgot their chagrin, and
paid their respects so piously to the bottle, that
in a short time the Champaigne produced very
evident effects in the behaviour of all present.
