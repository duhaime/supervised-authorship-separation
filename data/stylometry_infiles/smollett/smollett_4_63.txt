I receive an extraordinary message at the
door of the long room, which I however
enter, and affront the Squire, who threatens
to take the law of me—I rebuke Melinda
for her malice—She weeps with
vexation—Lord Quiverwit is severe
upon me—I retort his sarcasm—am
received with the utmost tenderness by Narcissa,
who desires to hear the story of my
life—we vow eternal constancy to one
another—I retire—am waked by a
messenger, who brings a challenge from
Quiverwit, whom I meet, engage, and
vanquish. 
I thanked him for his advice, which, however,
my pride and resentment would not
permit me to follow; for he no sooner left me,
in order to do justice to my character among his
friends and acquaintance, than I sallied out, and
went directly to the long-room. —I was met at
the door by a servant, who presented to me a
billet without a subscription, importing that my
presence was disagreeable to the company, and desiring
I would take the hint without further disturbance,
and bestow myself elsewhere for the future. 
—This peremptory message filled me with indignation. 
—I followed the fellow who delivered it,
and seizing him by the collar, in presence of all 

the company, threatned to put him instantly to
death, if he did not discover the scoundrel who
had charged him with such an impudent commission,
that I might punish him as he deserved. — 
The messenger, affrighted at my menaces and furious
looks, fell upon his knees, and told me, that
the gentleman who ordered him to deliver the
letter was no other than Narcissa's brother, who
at that time stood at the other end of the room,
talking to Melinda. —I went up to him immediately,
and in the hearing of his inamorata, accosted
him in these words: “Lookee, Squire, was
it not for one consideration that protects you
from my resentment, I would cane you where you
stand, for having had the presumption to send
me this scurrilous intimation,” which I tore to
pieces and threw in his face; at the same time darting
an angry regard at his mistress, and telling her,
I was sorry she had put it out of my power to
compliment her upon her invention, but at the
expence of her good nature and veracity. —Her
admirer, whose courage never rose but in proportion
to the wine he had swallowed, instead
of resenting my address in what is called an honourable
way, threatned to prosecute me for an
assault, and took witnesses accordingly; while she,
piqued at his pusilanimous behaviour, and enraged
at the sarcasm I had uttered against her, endeavoured
to make her quarrel a publick cause, and
wept aloud with spite and vexation. —The tears
of a lady could not fail of attracting the notice
and concern of the spectators, to whom she complained
of my rudeness, with great bitterness,
saying, If she was a man I durst not use her so. 
—The greatest part of the gentlemen, already
prejudiced against me, were offended at the liberty 

I had taken, as appeared from their looks; 
though none of them signified their disgust any
other way, except my Lord Quiverwit, who ventured
to say with a sneer, that I was in the right
to establish my own character, of which he had
now no longer any doubt. —Nettled at this severe
equivoque, which raised a laugh at my expence,
I replied with some warmth, “I am
proud of having in that particular got the
start of your lordship.” —He made no answer
to my repartee, but with a contemptuous smile,
walked off, leaving me in a very disagreeable
situation. —In vain did I make up to several
people of my acquaintance, whose conversation, I
hoped, would banish my confusion; every body
shunned me like a person infected, and I should
not have been able to bear my disgrace, had not
the idea of the ever faithful and fond Narcissa
come to my relief. —I quitted the scene of my
mortification, and sauntering about the town,
happened to wake from my contemplation, when
I found myself just opposite to a toy-shop, which
I entered, and purchased a ring set with a ruby
in the form of a heart, surrounded by diamond
sparks, for which I paid ten guineas, intending
it for a present to the charmer of my soul. 
I was introduced, at the hour appointed, to this
divine creature, who, notwithstanding what she
had heard to my disadvantage, received me with
the utmost confidence and tenderness; and having
been informed of the general sketches of my
life, by Miss Williams, expressed a desire of
knowing the particular circumstances, which I
related with great candour, omitting however,
some things which I concluded altogether improper
for her ear, and which the reader's reflection 

will easily suggest. —As my story was little else
than a recital of misfortunes, the tear of sympathy
ceased not to trickle from her inchanting eyes,
during the whole of the narration, which when
I had finished, she recompensed me for my trouble,
with the most endearing protestations of eternal
love. —She bewailed her restricted condition,
as it was the means of retarding my happiness; 
told me, that Lord Quiverwit, by her brother's
permission, had been to drink tea with her that
very afternoon, and actually proposed marriage; and
seeing me extremely affected with this piece of information,
offered to give me a convincing proof
of her affection, by espousing me in private, and
leaving the rest to fate. —I was penetrated with
this instance of her regard, but that I might not
be outdone in generosity, resisted the bewitching
temptation, in consideration of her honour and
interest; at the same time, presented my ring
as a pledge of my inviolable attachment, and on
my knees, implored heaven to shower its curses
on my head, if ever my heart should entertain
one thought unworthy of the passion that I then
avowed. —She received my token, gave me in
return her picture in miniature, exquisitely drawn
and set in gold; and in the same posture called
heaven to witness and to judge her flame. —Our
vows thus reciprocally breathed, a confidence of
hope ensued, and our mutual fondness becoming
as intimate as innocence would allow, I grew
insensible of the progress of time, and it was
morning before I could tear myself from this
darling of my soul! —My good angel foresaw
what would happen, and prompted me to indulge
myself on this occasion, in consideration of the
fatal absence I was doomed to suffer. 

I went to bed immediately on my return to
my lodging, and having slept about two hours,
was waked by Strap, who, in great confusion,
told me, there was a footman below with a letter
for me, which he would deliver to no body
but myself. —Alarmed at this piece of news, I
desired my friend to shew him up to my chamber,
and received a letter from him, which, he
said, required an immediate answer: Upon which
I opened it, and read 

“SIR,
When any man injures my honour,
let the difference of rank between us be
ever so great, I am contented to wave the
privilege of my quality, and seek reparation
from him on equal terms. —The insolence
of your reply to me yesterday, in the long-room,
I might have overlooked, had not
your presumptive emulation in a much more
interesting affair, and a discovery which I made
this morning, concurred in persuading me to
chastise your audacity with my sword. —If
you therefore, have spirit enough to support
the character you assume, you will not fail
to follow the bearer immediately to a convenient
place, where you shall be met by 
“Quiverwit.” 
Whether I was enervated by the love and
favour of Narcissa, or awed by the superior station
of my antagonist, I know not, but I never
had less inclination to fight than at this time: 
However, finding there was a necessity for vindicating 

the reputation of my mistress, as well as
for asserting my own honour, I forthwith rose,
and dressing in a hurry, put on my sword, bid
Strap attend me, and set out with my conductor,
cursing my bad fortune all the way, for having
been observed in my return from my angel
—So I interpreted his lordship discovery. —When
I came within sight of my rival, his lacquey
told me, he had orders to stop; upon which, I
commanded Strap to halt also, while I walked
forward; resolved, if possible, to come to an explanation
with my challenger, before we should
come to battle. —Nor was an opportunity wanting; 
for I no sooner approached, than he asked
with a stern countenance, what business I had in
Mr. Tophall's garden, so early in the morning: 
—“I don't know, my Lord, (said I) how to
answer a question put to me with such a magisterial
haughtiness. —If your lordship will
please to expostulate calmly, you will have
no cause to repent of your condescension— 
Otherwise, I am not to be intimidated into
any confession.” —“There's no room for
denial (answered he) I saw you come out
with my own eyes.” —“Did any other person
see me?” (said I.) —“I neither know
nor care (said he) I want no other evidence
than that of my own senses.” —Pleased to hear
that the suspicion was confined to him alone, I
endeavoured to appease his jealousy, by owning
an intrigue with the waiting-maid; but he had
too much discernment to be so easily imposed
upon, and told me there was only one way to
convince him of the truth of what I alledged; 
which was no other than renouncing all claim to
Narcissa upon oath, and promising upon honour, 

never to speak to her for the future. —Exasperated
at this proposal, I unsheathed my sword,
saying, “Heavens! what title have you, or any
man on earth, to impose such terms on me!” 
He did the same, and making towards me with a
contracted brow, said I was a villain, and had
dishonoured Narcissa. “He's a scandalous villain
(I replied, in a transport of fury) who
brands me with that imputation! She is a
thousand times more chaste than the mother
who bore you; and I will assert her honour
with my heart's blood!” —So saying, I rushed
upon him with more eagerness than address,
and endeavouring to get within his point, received
a wound in my neck, which redoubled my rage. 
—He excelled me in temper as well as in skill,
by which means he partied my thrusts with great
calmness, until I had almost exhausted my spirits; 
and when he perceived me beginning to
flag, attacked me fiercely in his turn. —Finding
himself however better opposed than he expected,
he resolved to follow his longe, and close with me; 
accordingly, his sword entered my waistcoat,
on the side of the breast-bone, and running up
between my shirt and skin, appeared over my
left shoulder: I imagined that his weapon had
perforated my lungs, and of consequence, that
the wound was mortal; therefore determined
not to die unrevenged, I seized his shell, which
was close to my breast, before he could disintangle
his point, and keeping it fast with my left hand,
shortned my own sword with my right, intending
to run him through the heart; but he received
the thrust in the left arm, which penetrated
up to the shoulder-blade. —Disappointed in
this expectation, and afraid still that death 

would frustrate my revenge, I grappled with him,
and being much the stronger, threw him upon
the ground, where I wrested his sword out of his
hand, and so great was my confusion, instead of
turning the point upon him, struck out three of
his fore-teeth with the hilt. —In the mean time,
our servants seeing us fall, run up to separate and
assist us; but before their approach, I was upon
my feet, and had discovered, that my supposed
mortal wound was only a slight scratch. The
knowledge of my own safety, disarmed me of a
good deal of my resentment, and I began to enquire
with some concern into the situation of
my antagonist, who remained on the ground
bleeding plentifully at his mouth and arm. —I
helped his footman to raise him, and having
bound up his wound with my handkerchief, assured
him it was not dangerous; I likewise restored
his sword, and offered to support him to
his own house. —He thanked me, with an air of
sullen dignity; and whispering to me, that I should
hear from him soon, went away, leaning on his
servant's shoulder. 
I was surprized at this promise, which I construed
into a threat, and resolved, if ever he
should call me out again, to use whatever advantage
fortune might give me over him, in another
manner. —In the mean time, I had leisure
to take notice of Strap, who seemed quite stupified
with horror; and (after having recovered him
from his exstasy, with an assurance that I had
received no damage) to explain the nature of
this affair as we walked homeward. —By that
time I had got into my apartment, I found the
wound in my neck stiff and uneasy, and a good
deal of clotted blood run down upon my shirt: 

Upon which I pulled off my coat and waistcoat,
and unbuttoned my collar, that I might dress it
with more ease. —My friend no sooner perceived
my shirt quite dyed with blood, than imagining I
had got at least twenty dreadful wounds, he cried,
“O Jesus!” and fell flat on the floor. —I stopt
the bleeding with a little dry lint, and applying a
plaister over it, cleaned myself from the gore,
shifted and dressed, while he lay senseless at my
feet; so that when he recovered, and saw me
perfectly well, he could scarce believe his own
eyes. —Now that the danger was past, I was
very well pleased with what had happened, which
I did not doubt, would soon become known,
and consequently dignify my character not a
little in this place. —I was also proud of having
shewn myself, in some shape, worthy of the love
of Narcissa, who, I was persuaded, would not
think the worse of me for what I had done.
