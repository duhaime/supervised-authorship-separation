He attends his uncle with great affection, during
a fit of illness. Sets out again for London; 
meets with his friend Godfrey, who is prevailed
upon to accompany him to Bath; on the road to
which place, they chance to dine with a person,
who entertains them with a curious account of a
certain company of adventurers. 
Thus determined, he took leave of Emilia
and her mother, on pretence of going
to London upon some urgent business, and returned 

turned to the garison, leaving the good old lady
very much concerned, and the daughter incensed
at his behaviour, which was the more unexpected,
because Godfrey had told them, that the
commodore approved of his nephew's passion. 
Our adventurer found his uncle so ill of the
gout, which, for the first time, had taken possession
of his stomach, that his life was in imminent
danger, and the whole family in disorder:
he therefore took the reins of government in his
own hands, sent for all the physicians in the
neighbourhood, and attended him in person with
the most affectionate care, during the whole fit,
which lasted a fortnight, and then retired before
the strength of his constitution. 
When the old gentleman recovered his health,
he was so penetrated with Peregrine's behaviour,
that he actually would have made over to him his
whole fortune, and depended upon him for his
own subsistence, had not our youth opposed the
execution of the deed with all his influence and
might, and even persuaded him to make a will,
in which his friend Hatchway, and all his other
adherents, were liberally remembered, and his
aunt provided for, on her own terms. This
material point being settled, he, with his uncle's
permission, departed for London, after having
seen the family-affairs established under the direction
and administration of Mr. Jolter and the
lieutenant: for, by this time, Mrs. Trunnion
was wholly occupied with her spiritual concerns. 
On his first arrival at London, he sent a card
to the lodgings of Gauntlet, in consequence of
a direction from his mother; and that young
gentleman waited on him next morning, though
not with that alacrity of countenance and warmth 

of friendship, which might have been expected
from the intimacy of their former connexion. 
Nor was Peregrine himself actuated by the same
unreserved affection for the soldier, which he
had formerly entertained. Godfrey, over and
above the offence he had taken at Pickle's omission,
in point of corresponding with him, had
been informed, by a letter from his mother, of
the youth's cavalier behaviour to Emilia, during
his last residence at Winchester; and our young
gentleman (as we have already observed) was
disgusted at the supposed discovery which the soldier
had made, in his absence, to the commodore. 
They perceived their mutual umbrage at
meeting, and received each other with that civility
of reserve, which commonly happens between
two persons, when their friendship is in
the wane. 
Gauntlet at once divined the cause of the
other's displeasure; and, in order to vindicate his
own character, after the first compliments were
passed, took the opportunity of inquiring after
the health of the commodore, to tell Peregrine,
that while he tarried at the garison, in his return
from Dover, the subject of the conversation, one
night, happening to turn on our hero's passion,
the old gentleman had expressed his concern
about that affair; and, among other observations,
said, he supposed the object of his love was
some paultry hussy, whom he had picked up
when he was a boy at school. Upon which,
Mr. Hatchway assured him, that she was a young
woman of as good a family as any in the county; 
and after having prepossessed him in her favour,
ventured (out of the zeal of his friendship) to
tell who she was: wherefore, the discovery was 

not to be imputed to any other cause: and he
hoped Mr. Pickle would acquit him of all share
in the transaction. 
Peregrine was very well pleased to be thus undeceived; 
his countenance immediately cleared
up, the formality of his behaviour relaxed into
his usual familiarity; he asked pardon for his unmannerly
neglect of Godfrey's letter, which, he
protested, was not owing to any disregard, or
abatement of friendship, but to a hurry of youthful
engagements, in consequence of which, he
had procrastinated his answer from time to time,
until he was ready to return in person. 
The young soldier was contented with this
apology; and as Pickle's intention, with respect
to his sister, was still dubious and undeclared, he
did not think it was incumbent upon him, as
yet, to express any resentment on that score; 
but was wise enough to foresee, that the renewal
of his intimacy with our young gentleman,
might be the means of reviving that flame which
had been dissipated by a variety of new ideas. 
With those sentiments he laid aside all reserve,
and their communication immediately resumed its
former channel. Peregrine made him acquainted
with all the adventures in which he had been engaged
since their parting; and he, with the same
confidence, related the remarkable incidents of
his own fate; among other things, giving him
to understand, that upon obtaining a commission
in the army, the father of his dear Sophy, without
once inquiring about the occasion of his promotion,
had not only favoured him with his
countenance in a much greater degree than heretofore,
but also contributed his interest, and even
promised the assistance of his purse, in procuring 

for him a lieutenancy, which he was then soliciting
with all his power; whereas, if he had
not been enabled, by a most accidental piece of
good fortune, to lift himself into the sphere of
an officer, he had all the reason in the world to
believe, that this gentleman, and all the rest of
his wealthy relations, would have suffered him to
languish in obscurity and distress; and, by turning
his misfortune into reproach, made it a plea
for their own want of generosity and friendship. 
Peregrine, understanding this situation of his
friend's affairs, would have accommodated him,
upon the instant, with a sum to accelerate the
passage of his commission through the offices; 
but, being too well acquainted with his scrupulous
disposition, to manifest his benevolence in
that manner, he found means to introduce himself
to one of the gentlemen of the war-office,
who was so well satisfied with the arguments he
used in behalf of his friend, that Godfrey's business
was transacted in a very few days, though
he himself knew nothing of his interest's being
thus reinforced. 
By this time, the season at Bath was begun; 
and our hero, panting with the desire of distinguishing
himself at that resort of the fashionable
world, communicated his design of going thither
to his friend Godfrey, whom he importuned to
accompany him in the excursion: and leave of
absence from his regiment being obtained, by
the influence of Peregrine's new quality-friends,
the two companions departed from London in a
post-chaise, attended, as usual, by the valet de
chambre and Pipes, who were become almost as 

necessary to our adventurer as any two of his
own organs. 
At the inn, when they alighted for dinner,
Godfrey perceived a person walking by himself
in the yard, with a very pensive air, and upon
observing him more narrowly, recognized him
to be a professed gamester, whom he had formerly
known at Tunbridge. On the strength
of this acquaintance, he accosted the peripatetic,
who knew him immediately; and, in the fulness
of his grief and vexation, told him, that he
was now on his return from Bath, where he had
been stripp'd by a company of sharpers, who resented
that he should presume to trade upon his
own bottom. 
Peregrine, who was extremely curious in his
inquiries, imagining that he might learn some
entertaining and useful anecdotes from this artist,
invited him to dinner, and was accordingly fully
informed of all the political systems at the Bath. 
He understood, that there was at London one
great company of adventurers, who employed
agents, in all the different branches of imposition,
throughout the whole kingdom of England,
allowing these ministers a certain proportion
of the profits accruing from their industry
and skill, and reserving the greatest share for the
benefit of the common stock, which was chargeable
with the expence of fitting out individuals
in their various pursuits, as well as with the loss
sustained in the course of their adventures. Some,
whose persons and qualifications are by the company
judged adequate to the task, exert their talents
in making love to ladies of fortune, being
accommodated with money and accoutrements 

for that purpose, after having given their bonds
payable to one or other of the directors, on the
day of marriage, for certain sums, proportioned
to the dowries they are to receive. Others,
versed in the doctrine of chances, and certain
secret expedients, frequent all those places where
games of hazard are allowed; and such as are
masters in the arts of billiards, tennis and bowls,
are continually lying in wait, in all the scenes of
these diversions, for the ignorant and unwary. 
A fourth class attend horse-races, being skilled in
those mysterious practices, by which the knowing-ones
are taken in. Nor is this community unfurnished
with those who lay wanton wives and
old rich widows under contribution, and extort
money, by prostituting themselves to the embraces
of their own sex, and then threatening
their admirers with prosecution. But their most
important returns are made by that body of their
undertakers who exercise their understandings in
the innumerable stratagems of the card-table, at
which no sharper can be too infamous to be received,
and even caressed by persons of the highest
rank and distinction. Among other articles of
intelligence, our young gentleman learn'd, that
those agents, by whom their guest was broke,
and expelled from Bath, had constituted a bank
against all sporters, and monopolized the advantage
in all sorts of play. He then told Gauntlet,
that if he would put himself under his direction,
he would return with them, and lay
such a scheme, as would infallibly ruin the whole
society at billiards, as he knew that Godfrey excelled
them all in his knowledge of that game. 
The soldier excused himself from engaging in
any party of that kind; and after dinner the travellers 

parted; but, as the conversation between
the two friends turned upon the information
they had received, Peregrine projected a plan for
punishing those villanous pests of society, who
prey upon their fellow creatures; and it was put
in execution by Gauntlet, in this manner.
