I discover a subornation against me, by means
of a quarrel between two of the evidences; 
in consequence of which, I am set at liberty,
and prevail upon Morgan to accept of
his freedom on the same terms—Mackshane's
malice—we arrive at Jamaica,
from whence in a short time we beat up to
Hispaniola, in conjunction with the West-Indian
squadron—we take in water, sail
again, and arrive at Carthagena— 
reflections on our conduct there. 
Mean while, a quarrel happening between
the two modern Greeks, the
one to be revenged of the other, came and
discovered to us the mystery of Mackshane's dialogue,
as I have explained it above. This
detection coming to the ears of the doctor, who
was sensible that (now we were in sight of Jamaica)
we should have an opportunity of clearing
ourselves before a court-martial, and at the
same time, of making his malice and ignorance
conspicuous, he interceeded for us with the captain
so effectually, that in a few hours we
were set at liberty, and ordered to return to our
duty. —This was a happy event for me, my
whole body being blistered by the sun, and my
limbs benumbed for want of motion: But I could
not persuade the Welchman to accept of this indulgence, 

he persisting in his obstinacy to remain
in irons until he should be discharged by a court-martial,
which he believed would also do him
justice on his enemies; at length, I represented
to him the precarious issue of a trial, the power
and interest of his adversaries, and flattered his
revenge with the hope of wreaking his resentment
with his own hands upon Mackshane after
our return to England: This last argument had
more weight with him than all the rest, and prevailed
upon him to repair with me to the cockpit,
which I no sooner entered, than the idea of
my departed friend presented itself to my remembrance,
and filled my eyes with tears. —We
discharged from our mess the boy who had acted
so perfidiously, notwithstanding his tears, intreaties,
and professions of penitence for what he
had done; but not before he had confessed that
the surgeon had bribed him to give evidence against
us, with a pair of stockings and a couple
of old-check shirts, which his servant had since
plundered him of. 
The keys of our chests and lockers being sent
to us by the doctor, we detained the messenger
until we had examined the contents; and my
fellow-mate finding all his Cheshire cheese consumed
to a crust, his brandy exhausted, and his
onions gone, was seized with a fit of choler,
which he discharged on Mackshane's man in oaths
and execrations, threatning to prosecute him as a
thief. —The fellow swore in his turn that he never
had the keys in his possession till that time, when
he received them from his master, with orders to
deliver them to us. —“As Got is my judge
(cried Morgan) and my salsation, and my
witness, whosoever has pilfered my provisions, 

is a lousy, beggarly, rascally knave! and by
the soul of my grandsire! I will impeach, and
accuse, and indict him of a roppery, if I did
but know who he is.” —Had this happened
at sea where we could not repair the loss, in all
probability, this descendant of Cadwallader would
have lost his wits entirely: but when I observed,
how easy it would be to make up for this paultry
misfortune, he became more calm, and reconciled
himself to the occasion. —A little while after,
the surgeon came into the birth, under pretence
of taking something out of the medicine-chest,
and with a smiling aspect, wished us joy of our
deliverance, which (he said) he had been at great
pains to obtain of the captain, who was very
justly incensed at our behaviour; but he (the
doctor) had passed his word for our conduct in
time to come, and he hoped we should give him
no cause to repent of his kindness. —He expected
(no doubt) an acknowledgment from us for this
pretended piece of service, as well as a general
amnesty of what was past; but he had to do
with people who were not quite so apt to forgive
injuries as he imagined, or to forget that if our
deliverance was owing to his mediation, our calamity
was occasioned by his malice; I therefore
sat silent while my companion answered, “Ay,
ay, 'tis no matter—Got knows the heart— 
there is a time for all things, as the wise man
saith, there is a time for throwing away stones,
and a time to gather them up again.” —He
seemed to be disconcerted at this reply, and went
away in a pet, muttering something about “Ingratitude” 
and “Fellows,” which we did not
think fit to take any notice of. 

Our fleet having joined another that waited for
us, lay at anchor about a month in the harbour
of Port-Royal in Jamaica, during which time
something of consequence was certainly transacted,
notwithstanding the insinuations of some who affirmed
we had no business at all in that place— 
that in order to take the advantage of the season
proper for our enterprize, the West-Indian squadron,
which had previous notice of our coming,
ought to have joined us at the west end of Hispaniola
with necessary stores and refreshments,
from whence we could have sailed directly to
Carthagena, before the enemy could put themselves
in a good posture of defence, or indeed
have an inkling of our design. Be this as it
will, we sailed from Jamaica, and in ten days or
a fortnight, beat up against the wind as far as
the isle of Vache, with an intention, as was
said, to attack the French fleet, then supposed to
be lying near that place; but before we arrived
they had sailed for Europe, having first dispatched
an advice-boat to Carthagena with an account of
our being in these seas, as also of our strength
and destination. —We loitered here some days
longer, taking in wood, and brackish water, in
the use whereof, however, our admiral seemed
to consult the health of the men, by restricting
each to a quart a day. —At length we set sail,
and arrived in a bay to the windward of Carthagena,
where we came to an anchor, and lay at
our ease ten days longer. —Here again, certain
malicious people take occasion to blame the conduct
of their superiors, by saying, this was not
only throwing away time, which was very precious
considering the approach of the rainy season,
but also giving the Spaniards time to recollect 

themselves, and recover from the consternation
they were thrown into at the approach of an
English fleet, at least three times as numerous as
ever appeared in that part of the world before. 
But if I might be allowed to give my opinion of
the matter, I would ascribe this delay to the generosity
of our chiefs, who scorned to take any
advantage that fortune might give them, even
over an enemy. At last, however, we weighed,
and anchored again somewhat nearer the harbour's
mouth, where we made shift to land our marines,
who encamped on the beach, in despite of the enemy's
shot, which knocked a good many of them
on the head. —This piece of conduct in chusing
a camp under the walls of an enemy's fortification,
which I believe never happened before,
was practised, I presume, with a view of accustoming
the soldiers to stand fire, who were not
as yet much used to discipline, most of them having
been taken from the plough-tail a few months
before. —This again has furnished matter for censure
against the Ministry, for sending a few raw
recruits on such an important enterprize, while
so many veteran regiments lay inactive at home: 
But surely our governours had their reasons for
so doing, which possibly may be disclosed with other
secrets of the deep. Perhaps they were loth
to risk their best troops on such desperate service; 
or, may be the colonels and field officers of the old
corps, who, generally speaking, enjoyed their commissions
as fine-cures or pensions, for some domestick
services tendered to the court, refused to
embark in such a dangerous and precarious undertaking; 
for which, no doubt, they are to be
much commended.
