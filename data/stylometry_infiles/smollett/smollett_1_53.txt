Triumphs over a medical rival. 
Yet, in the midst of all this attention, his
medical capacity seemed to be quite forgot. 
They respected his good breeding, were
charmed with his voice, and admired the fine
touches of his hand upon the violin; but, in
cultivating the fidler they utterly neglected the
physician; and in vain did he attempt to divide
their regard, by taking all opportunities to
turn the conversation into a more interesting
channel. It was to little purpose he endeavoured
to arouse the wonder of his audience
with frequent descriptions of portentuous maladies
and amazing cures he had seen and performed
in the course of his study and practice
abroad: and to no effect did he publickly busy
himself in making experiments on the mineral
water, in which he pretended to have made
several new and important discoveries. These
efforts did not make a lasting impression upon
the minds of the company; because they saw
nothing surprizing in a physician's being acquainted
with all the mysteries of his art; and,
as their custom was already bespoke for others
of the profession, whom it was their interest to
employ, our adventurer might have starved
amidst the caresses of his acquaintance, had not
he derived considerable advantage from a lucky
accident in the course of his expectancy. 
A gentlewoman's daughter, of a weakly constitution,
by drinking the waters, had so far
reovered her health and complexion, as to 

allure the affection of a young squire in the
neighbourhood, who amused her for some
time with his addresses, until his heart was
seduced by the charms of another young lady
lately arrived at the wells. The forsaken
nymph, shocked at this disgrace and mortification,
relapsed into her former languishing
disorder, and was by her mother put under
the management and prescription of a physician,
who had been an industrious enemy of Fathom,
from his first appearance at Tunbridge. The
patient, tho' violently chagrined at the levity
of her quondam admirer, was not altogether
without hope, that the very same inconstancy
which had prompted him to leave her, might
in time induce him to return, after the novelty
of his new passion should be wore off; and this
hope served to support her under the sorrow
and disgrace of her disappointment. At
length, however, the squire and his new mistress
disappeared, and some busy body was officious
enough to communicate this piece of news to
the forlorn shepherdess, with this additional
circumstance, that they were gone to a neighbouring
parish, to be joined in the bands of
wedlock. 
These fatal tidings were no sooner imparted
to the abandoned Phillis, than she was seized
with an hysteric fit; and, what rendered the
accident more unfortunate, her physician had
been called to the country, and was not expected
at Tunbridge till next day. The apothecary
was immediately summoned; and, being
either puzzled by the symptoms, or afraid
of encroaching upon the province of his superiors,
advised the old lady to send for doctor 

Fathom without delay. She had no other
objection to this expedient, but the enmity
which she knew subsisted between the two
leeches: yet hearing that her own doctor
would not consult with Fathom upon his return,
but, perhaps, renounce the patient, by
which means her daughter's health might be
endangered, she would not sollicit our hero's
assistance, until the young lady had remained
seven hours speechless and insensible; when
her fear prevailing over every other consideration,
she implored the advice of our adventurer,
who having made the necessary interrogations,
and felt the patient's pulse, which
was regular and distinct, found reason to conclude,
that the fit would not last much longer; 
and after having observed, that she was in
a very dangerous way, prescribed some medicines
for external application; and, to enhance
their opinion of his diligence and humanity,
resolved to stay in the room, and
observe their effect. 
His judgment did not fail him on this occasion. 
In less than half an hour after his embrocations
had been applied, she recovered the
use of her tongue, opened her eyes, and having
in delirious exclamations, upbraided her
perfidious lover, became quite sensible and
composed; though she continued extremely
low and dejected: to remedy these sinkings,
certain cordials were immediately administered,
according to the prescription of doctor
Fathom, upon whom extraordinary encomiums
were bestowed by all present, who believed
he had actually rescued her from the
jaws of death; and as he was, by this time, let 

into the secrets of the family, he found himself
in a fair way of being an egregious favourite
of the old gentlewoman; when, unluckly,
his brother having dismissed his country
patient with uncommon dispatch, entered
the apartment, and eyed his rival with looks
of inexpressible rage; then surveying the patient,
and the vials that stood upon the table,
by turns, “What, in the name of God!
(cried he) is the meaning of all this trash?” 
“Really, doctor, (replied the mother, a
little confounded at being thus taken by surprize)
Biddy has been taken dangerously ill, and
lain seven or eight hours in a severe fit, from
which, I am confident, she would never have
recovered, without the help of a physician; 
and as you were absent, we had recourse to
this gentleman, whose prescription hath had
an happy and surprising effect” “Effect!
(cried this offended member of the faculty)
pshaw! stuff, who made you judge of effects
or causes? (then advancing to the patient)
what has been the matter, miss Biddy, that
you could not wait till my return?” 
Here Fathom interposing, “Sir, (said he)
if you will step into the next room, I will
communicate my sentiments of the case, together
with the method upon which I have
proceeded, that we may deliberate upon the
next step that is to be taken.” Instead of complying
with this proposal, he seated himself in
a chair, with his back to our adventurer, and
while he examined miss Biddy's pulse, gave
him to understand, that he should not consult
with him about the matter. 
Fathom, not in the least disconcerted at this 

uncival answer, walked round his antagonist,
and placing himself in his front, desired to
know his reason for treating him with such supercilious
contempt. “I am resolved (said
the other) never to consult with any physician
who has not taken his degrees at either of the
English universities.” “Upon the supposition
(replied our adventurer) that no person
can be properly educated for the profession at
any other school.” “You are in the right:
swered doctor Looby) that is one of many
reasons I have to decline the consultation.” 
“How far you are in the right, (retorted
Fathom) I leave the world to judge, after I
have observed, that in your English universities,
there is no opportunity of studying the
art; no, not so much as a lecture given on
the subject: nor is there one physician of
note, in this kingdom, who has not derived
the greatest part of his medical knowledge,
from the instructions of foreigners.” 
Looby, incensed at this asseveration, which
he was not prepared to refute, exclaimed in a
most infuriate accent, “Who are you? whence
came you? where was you bred? you are one
of those, I believe, who graduate themselves,
and commence doctors, the Lords knows
how: an interloper, who, without licence or
authority, come hither to take the bread out
of the mouths of gentlemen, who have been
trained to the business in a regular manner,
and bestowed great pains and expence to qualify
themselves for the profession: for my own
part, my education cost me fifteen hundred
pounds.” 
“Never was money laid out to less purpose: 

(said Ferdinand) for it does not appear, that
you have learned so much as the basis of medical
acquirements, namely, that decorum and
urbanity which ought to distinguish the deportment
of every physician: you have even
debased the noblest and most beneficial art that
ever engaged the study of mankind, which
cannot be too much cultivated, and too little
restrained, in seeking to limit the practice of
it, to a set of narrow-minded illiberal wretches,
who, like the lowest handicraftsmen, claim
the exclusive privileges of a corporation: had
you doubted my ability, you ought to have satisfied
yourself in a manner consistent with decency
and candour: but your behaviour, on
this occasion, is such a malicious outrage upon
good manners and humanity, that, were it not
for my regard to these ladies, I would chastise
you for your insolence, on the spot. Mean
while, madam, (addressing himself to the mother)
you must give me leave to insist upon
your dismissing either that gentleman, or me,
without hesitation.” 
This peremptory language had an instantaneous
effect upon the hearers. Looby's face
grew pale, and his nether lip began to tremble:
the patient was dismayed, and the old gentlewoman
concerned and perplexed: she earnestly
besought the gentlemen to be reconciled to
each other, and enter into a friendly consultation
upon her daughter's distemper: but, finding
both equally averse to accommodation, and
Fathom becoming more and more importunate
in his demand, she presented him with a double
fee; and giving him to understand, that
doctor Looby had long attended the family, 

and was intimately acquainted with her own
and Biddy's constitution, said, she hoped he
would not take it amiss, if she retained her old
physician. 
Though our hero was much mortified at this
triumph of his rival, he made a virtue of necessity,
and retired with great complaisance,
wishing, that Miss Biddy might never again be
the subject of such a disagreeable dispute. 
Whether the patient was frighted at this altercation,
or displeased with her mother's decision
against an agreeable young fellow, who
had, as it were, recalled her from the grave,
and made himself master of the secret that
rankled at her heart; or the disease had wound
up her nerves for another paroxysm; certain
it is, she, all of a sudden, broke forth into a
violent peal of laughter, which was succeeded
by the most doleful cries, and other expressions
of grief; then she relapsed into a fit, attended
with strong convulsions, to the unspeakable
terror of the old gentlewoman, who
intreated doctor Looby to be expeditious in his
prescription: accordingly, he seized the pen
with great confidence, and a whole magazine
of anti-hysteric medicines were, in different
forms, externally and internally applied. 
Nevertheless, either nature was disturbed,
in her own efforts, by these applications, or
the patient was resolved to disgrace the doctor:
for the more remedies that were administered,
her convulsions became the more violent; 
and in spite of all his endeavours, he
could not overcome the obstinacy of the distemper. 
Such a miscarriage upon the back
of his rival's success, could not fail to overwhelm 

him with confusion; especially as the
mother baited him with repeated intreaties, to
do something for the recovery of her daughter; 
at length, after having exercised her patience
in vain, for several hours, this affectionate
parent could no longer suppress the suggestions
of her concern, but, in an incoherent
strain, told him, that her duty would
not suffer her to be longer silent in an affair on
which depended the life of her dear child:
that she had seen enough, to believe he had
mistaken the case of poor Biddy, and he could
not justly blame her for recalling doctor Fathom,
whose prescription had operated in a
miraculous manner. 
Looby, shocked at this proposal, protested
against it with great vehemence, as an expedient
highly injurious to himself. “My remedies
(said he) are just beginning to take effect,
and, in all probability, the fit will not
last much longer; so that by calling in another
person, at this juncture, you will defraud me
of that credit which is my due, and deck my
adversary with trophies, to which he has no
pretension.” She was prevailed upon, by
this remonstrance, to wait another half hour,
when perceiving, as yet, no alteration for the
better, and being distracted with her fears
which reproached her with want of natural
affection, she sent a message to doctor Fathom,
desing to see him with all possible dispatch. 
He was not slow in obeying the call, but hastening
to the scene of action, was not a little
surprized to find Looby still in the apartment. 
This gentleman, since better might not be, resolved 

to sacrifice his pride to his interest, and,
rather than lose his patient altogether, and run
the risque of forfeiting his reputation at the
same time, staid with intention to compromise
his difference with Fathom, that he might
not be wholly excluded from the honour of
the cure, in case it could be effected: but he
had reckoned without his host, in his calculation
of the count's placability; for when he
put on his capilating face, and after a slight
apology for his late behaviour, proposed that
all animosity should subside in favour of the
young lady, whose life was at stake, our hero
rejected his advances with infinite disdain, and
assured the mother, in a very solemn tone,
that, far from consulting with a man who had
treated him so unworthily, he would not stay
another minute in the house, unless he should
see him discarded; a satisfaction barely sufficient
to attone for the affront he himself had
suffered by the unjust preference she had before
given to his rival. 
There was no remedy: Looby was obliged
to retreat in his turn; then our adventurer
approaching the bed side, reconnoitered the
patient, examined the medicines which had
been administered, and lifting up his eyes in
expressive silence, detached the footman with
a new order to the apothecary. It was well
the messenger used expedition, otherwise doctor
Fathom would have been anticipated by
the operation of nature; for, the fit having
almost run its carreer, miss Biddy was on the
point of retrieving her senses, when the frontal
prescribed by Fathom was applied; to the
efficacy of this, therefore, was ascribed her 

recovery, when she opened her eyes, and began
to pour forth unconnected ejaculations; and
in a few moments after, she was persuaded to
swallow a draught prepared for the purpose,
her perception returned, and Ferdinand gained
the reputation of having performed a second
miracle. 
But he was furnished with a piece of intelligence,
of much more energy than all she had
taken, and so soon as he concluded she was
capable to bear the news, without any dangerous
emotion, he, among other articles of chitchat
culled for her amusement, took the opportunity
of telling the company, that 'squire
Stub (the cause of miss Biddy's disorder) had,
in his way to matrimony, been robbed of his bride
by a gentleman to whom she had been formerly
engaged. He had waited for her, on purpose
at an inn on the road, where he found means
to appease her displeasure, which he had, it
seems, incurred, and to supersede her new
lover, whom she quitted without ceremony; 
upon which the squire had returned to Tunbridge,
cursing her levity, yet blessing his good
stars for having so seasonably prevented his
ruin, which would have infallibly been the consequence
of his marrying such an adventurer. 
It would be superfluous to observe, that these
tidings operated, like an admirable specifick,
on the spirits of the young lady, who, while
she affected to pity the 'squire, was so much
overjoyed at his disappointment, that her eyes
began to sparkle with uncommon vivacity, and
in less than two hours after the last of those
terrible attacks, she was restored to a better
state of health than she had enjoyed for many 

weeks. Fathom was not forgot amidst the rejoicings
of the family: besides an handsome
gratuity for the effects of his extraordinary skill,
the old lady favoured him with a general invitation
to her house, and the daughter not
only considered him as the restorer of her health
and angel of her good fortune, but also began
to discover an uncomnom relish for his conversation; 
so that he was struck with the prospect
of succeeding 'squire Stub in her affection; a
conquest, which, if sanctioned by the approbation
of the mother, would console him for all
the disappointments he had sustained; for Miss
Biddy was intitled to a fortune of ten thousand
pounds, provided she should marry with the
consent of her parent, who was the sole executrix
of the father's will. 
Animated with the hope of such an advantageous
match, our adventurer missed no opportunity
of improving the lodgement he had
made; while the two ladies failed not to extol
his medical capacity, among all their female
acquaintance. By means of this circulation,
his advice was demanded in several other cases,
which he managed with such an imposing air
of sagacity and importance, that his fame began
to spread, and before the end of the season, he
had ravished more than one half of the business
from his competitor. Notwithstanding these
fortunate events, he foresaw, that he should
find great difficulty in transplanting his reputation,
so as to take root in London, which was
the only soil in which he could propose to rise
to any degree of prosperity and independance; 
and this reflection was grounded upon a maxim
which universally prevails among the English 

people, namely, to overlook and wholly neglect
on their return to the metropolis, all the connexions
they may have chanced to acquire during
their residence at any of the medical wells; 
and this social disposition is so scrupulously maintained,
that two persons, who lived in the most
intimate correspondence at Bath or Tunbridge,
shall, in four and twenty hours, so totally forget
their friendship, as to meet in St James's
park, without betraying the least token of
recognition; so that one would imagine those
mineral waters were so many streams issuing
from the river Lethe, so famed of old, for
washing away all traces of memory and recollection. 
Aware of this oblivious principle, doctor Fathom
collected all his qualifications, in order to
make such an impression upon the heart of
Miss Biddy, as would resist all her endeavours
to shake him from her remembrance: and
his efforts succeeded so well, that 'squire Stub's
advances to a reconciliation, were treated with
manifest indifference. In all probability, our
hero would have made a very advantageous
campaign, had not his good fortune been retarded
by an obstruction, which (as he did not
perceive it) he could not possibly surmount:
in displaying his accomplishments to captivate
the daughter, he had unwittingly made an absolute
conquest of the mother, who superintended
the conduct of Miss Biddy, with such jealous
vigilance, that he could find no opportunity
of profiting by the progress he had made in
her heart; for the careful matron would never
lose sight of her, no, not for one moment. 

Had the old lady given the least intimation
to our adventurer, of the sentiments she entertained
in his behalf, his complaisance was of
such a pliable texture, that he would have
quitted his other pursuit, and made her the sole
object of his attention: but she either depended
upon the effect of his own good taste and discernment,
or was too proud to disclose a passion
which he had hitherto overlooked.
