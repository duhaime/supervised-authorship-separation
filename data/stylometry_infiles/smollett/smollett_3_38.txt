Peregrine takes leave of his aunt and sister, sets
out from the garison, parts with his uncle and
Hatchway on the road, and with his governor
arrives in safety at Dover. 
This, however, was the last effort of invention
which they practised upon him; 
and every thing being now prepared for the departure
of his godson, that hopeful youth in two
days took leave of all his friends in the neighbourhood,
was closeted two whole hours with
his aunt,
who inriched him with many pious advices,
recapitulated all the benefits which, through
her means, had been conferred upon him since 

his infancy, cautioned him against the temptations
of lewd women, who bring many a man
to a morsel of bread, laid strict injunctions upon
him, to live in the fear of the Lord and the true
protestant faith, to eschew quarrels and contention,
to treat Mr. Jolter with reverence and regard,
and above all things to abstain from the
beastly sin of drunkenness, which exposeth a
man to the scorn and contempt of his fellow-creatures,
and by divesting him of reason and reflection,
renders him fit for all manner of vice
and debauchery. She recommended to him œconomy
and the care of his health, bad him remember
the honour of his family, and in all the
circumstances of his behaviour, assured him, that
he might always depend upon the friendship and
generosity of the commodore; and finally, presenting
him with her own picture set in gold,
and an hundred guineas from her privy purse,
embraced him affectionately, and wished him all
manner of happiness and prosperity. 
Being thus kindly dismissed by Mrs. Trunnion,
he locked himself up with his sister Julia, whom
he admonished to cultivate her aunt with the most
complaisant and respectful attention, without
stooping to any circumstance of submission that
she should judge unworthy of her practice; he
protested, that his chief study should be to make
her amends for the privilege she had forfeited
by her affection for him; intreated her to enter
into no engagement without his knowledge and
approbation, put into her hand the purse which
he had received from his aunt, to defray her
pocket expences in his absence, and parted from
her, not without tears, after she had for some
minutes hung about his neck, kissing him and
weeping in the most pathetic silence. 

Having performed these duties of affection and
consanguinity over-night, he went to bed, and
was by his own direction, called at four o'clock
in the morning, when he found the post-chaise,
coach and riding-horses ready at the gate, his
friends Gauntlet and Hatchway on foot, the commodore
himself almost dressed, and every servant
in the garison assembled in the yard, to wish him
a good journey. Our hero shook each of these
humble friends by the hand, tipping them at the
same time with marks of his bounty; and was
very much surprized when he could not perceive
his old attendant Pipes among the number. When
he expressed his wonder at this disrespectful omission
of Tom, some of those present ran to his
chamber, in order to give him a call, but his
hammock and room were both deserted, and they
soon returned with an account of his having eloped. 
Peregrine was disturbed at this information, believing
that the fellow had taken some desperate
course, in consequence of his being dismissed from
his service, and began to wish that he had indulged
his inclination, by retaining him still about his
person. However, as there was now no other
remedy, he recommended him strenuously to the
particular favour and distinction of his uncle and
Hatchway, in case he should appear again; and
as he went out at the gate, was saluted with three
chears by all the domestics in the family. The
commodore, Gauntlet, lieutenant, Peregrine and
Jolter went into the coach together, that they
might enjoy each other's conversation as much as
possible, resolving to breakfast at an inn upon the
road, where Trunnion and Hatchway intended
to bid our adventurer farewel; the valet de chambre
got into the post-chaise, the French lacquey
rode one horse and led another, one of the valets 

of the garison mounted at the back of the coach; 
and thus the cavalcade set out on the road to Dover. 
As the commodore could not bear the fatigue
of jolting, they travelled at an easy pace
during the first stage; so that the old gentleman
had an opportunity of communicating his exhortations
to his godson, with regard to his conduct
abroad; he advised him, now that he was going
into foreign parts, to be upon his guard against
the fair weather of the French politesse, which
was no more to be trusted than a whirlpool at sea. 
He observed that many young men had gone to
Paris with good cargoes of sense, and returned
with a great deal of canvas, and no ballast at all,
whereby they became crank all the days of their
lives, and sometimes carried their keels above water. 
He desired Mr. Jolter to keep his pupil out
of the clutches of those sharking priests who lie in
wait to make converts of all young strangers, and
in a particular manner cautioned the youth against
carnal conversation with the Parisian dames, who,
he understood, were no better than gaudy fire-ships
ready primed with death and destruction. 
Peregrine listened with great respect, thanking
him for his kind admonitions, which he faithfully
promised to observe. They halted and breakfasted at
the end of the stage, where Jolter provided himself
with a horse, and the commodore settled the method
of corresponding with his nephew; and the
minute of parting being arrived, the old commander
wrung his godson by the hand, saying, “I
wish thee a prosperous voyage and good cheer,
my lad; my timbers are now a little crazy, d'ye
see; and God knows if I shall keep afloat till
such time as I see thee again; but, howsomever,
hap what will, thou wilt find thyself in a condition
to keep in the line with the best of thy fellows.” 

He then reminded Gauntlet of his promise
to call at the garison in his return from Dover,
and imparted something in a whisper to the
governor, while Jack Hatchway unable to speak,
pulled his hat over his eyes, and squeezing Peregrine
by the hand, gave him an iron pistol of curious
workmanship, as a memorial of his friendship. 
Our youth, who was not unmoved on this
occasion, received the pledge, which he acknowledged
with the present of a silver tobacco-box,
that he had bought for that purpose; and the two
lads of the castle getting into the coach, were
driven homewards, in a state of silent dejection. 
Godfrey and Peregrine seated themselves in the
post-chaise, and Jolter, the valet de chambre and
lacquey bestriding their beasts, they proceeded for
the place of their destination, at which they arrived
in safety that same night, and bespoke a passage
in the pacquet-boat which was to sail next day.
