DEAR DOCTOR,
I HAVE now reached the northern extremity
of England, and see, close to my chamber-window,
the Tweed gliding through the arches of that bridge
which connects this suburb to the town of Berwick. 
—Yorkshire you have seen, and therefore I shall
say nothing of that opulent province. The city of
Durham appears like a confused heap of stones and
brick, accumulated so as to cover a mountain, round
which a river winds its brawling course. The streets
are generally narrow, dark, and unpleasant, and
many of them almost impassible in consequence of
their declivity. The cathedral is a huge gloomy
pile; but the clergy are well lodged. —The bishop
lives in a princely manner—the golden prebends
keep plentiful tables—and, I am told, there is
some good sociable company in the place; but
the country, when viewed from the top of Gateshead
Fell, which extends to Newcastle, exhibits
the highest scene of cultivation that ever I beheld. 

As for Newcastle, it lies mostly in a bottom, on
the banks of the Tyne, and makes an appearance
still more disagreeable than that of Durham; but it
is rendered populous and rich by industry and commerce; 
and the country lying on both sides the
river, above the town, yields a delightful prospect
of agriculture and plantation. Morpeth and Alnwick
are neat, pretty towns, and this last is famous
for the castle which has belonged so many ages to
the noble house of Piercy, earls of Northumberland. 
—It is, doubtless, a large edifice, containing
a great number of apartments, and stands in a
commanding situation; but the strength of it seems
to have consisted not so much in its site, or the
manner in which it is fortified, as in the valour of
its defendants. 
Our adventures since we left Scarborough, are
scarce worth reciting; and yet I must make you
acquainted with my sister Tabby's progress in husband-hunting,
after her disappointments at Bath
and London. She had actually begun to practise upon
a certain adventurer, who was in fact a highwayman
by profession; but he had been used to
snares much more dangerous than any she could lay,
and escaped accordingly. —Then she opened her
batteries upon an old weather-beaten Scotch lieutenant,
called Lismahago, who joined us at Durham,
and is, I think, one of the most singular personages
I ever encountered. —His manner is as
harsh as his countenance; but his peculiar turn of
thinking, and his pack of knowledge made up of the
remnants of rarieties, rendered his conversation desirable,
in spite of his pedantry and ungracious address. 
—I have often met with a crab-apple in a
hedge, which I have been tempted to eat for its flavour,
even while I was disgusted by its austerity. 
The spirit of contradiction is naturally so strong in
Lismahago, that I believe in my conscience he has 

rummaged, and read, and studied with indefatigable
attention, in order to qualify himself to refute
established maxims, and thus raise trophies for the
gratification of polemical pride. —Such is the asperity
of self-conceit, that he will not even acquiesce
in a transient compliment made to his own
individual in particular, or to his country in general. 
When I observed, that he must have read a vast
number of books to be able to discourse on such a
variety of subjects, he declared he had read little
or nothing, and asked how he should find books
among the woods of America, where he had spent
the greatest part of his life. My nephew remarking
that the Scots in general were famous for their
learning, he denied the imputation, and defied him
to prove it from their works. —“the Scots (said
he) have a slight tincture of letters, with which
they make a parade among people who are more
illiterate than themselves; but they may be said
to float on the surface of science, and they have
made very small advances in the useful arts.” 
“At least, (cried Tabby) all the world allows
that the Scots behave gloriously in fighting
and conquering the savages of America.” “I can
assure you, madam, you have been misinformed
(replied the lieutenant); in that continent
the Scots did nothing more than their duty, nor
was there one corps in his majesty's service that
distinguished itself more than another. —Those
who affected to extol the Scots for superior merit,
were no friends to that nation.” 
Though he himself made free with his countrymen,
he would not suffer any other person to
glance a sarcasm at them with impunity. One of
the company chancing to mention lord B&wblank;'s inglorious
peace, the lieutenant immediately took up
the cudgels in his lordship's favour, and argued
very strenuously to prove that it was the most honourable 

and advantageous peace that England
had ever made since the foundation of the monarchy. 
—Nay, between friends, he offered such reasons
on this subject, that I was really confounded,
if not convinced. —He would not allow that the
Scots abounded above their proportion in the army
and navy of Great-Britain, or that the English had
any reason to say his countrymen had met with extraordinary
encouragement in the service. — 
“When a South and North-Briton (said he) are
competitors for a place or commission, which is
in the disposal of an English minister or an English
general, it would be absurd to suppose that
the preference will not be given to the native of
England, who has so many advantages over his
rival. —First and formost, he has in his favour
that laudable partiality, which, Mr. Addison says,
never fails to cleave to the heart of an Englishman; 
secondly, he has more powerful connexions,
and a greater share of parliamentary interest,
by which those contests are generally decided; 
and lastly, he has a greater command of
money to smooth the way to his success. For
my own part, (said he) I know no Scotch officer,
who has risen in the army above the rank of a
subaltern, without purchasing every degree of
preferment either with money or recruits; but
I know many gentlemen of that country, who,
for want of money and interest, have grown grey
in the rank of lieutenants; whereas very few
instances of this ill-fortune are to be found
among the natives of South-Britain. —Not that
I would insinuate that my countrymen have the
least reason to complain. —Preferment in the
service, like success in any other branch of traffic,
will naturally favour those who have the
greatest stock of cash and credit, merit and capacity
being supposed equal on all sides.” 

But the most hardy of all this original's positions
were these: —That commerce would, sooner
or later, prove the ruin of every nation, where it
flourishes to any extent —That the parliament was
the rotten part of the British constitution—that
the liberty of the press was a national evil—and
that the boasted institution of juries, as managed in
England was productive of shameful perjury and
flagrant injustice. He observed, that traffic was
an enemy to all the liberal passions of the soul,
founded on the thirst of lucre, a sordid disposition
to take advantage of the necessities of our fellow-creatures. 
—He affirmed, the nature of commerce
was such, that it could not be fixed or perpetuated,
but, having slowed to a certain height, would immediately
begin to ebb, and to continue till the
channels should be left almost dry; but there was
no instance of the tide's rising a second time to any
considerable influx in the same nation. Mean while
the sudden affluence occasioned by trade, forced
open all the sluices of luxury, and overflowed the
land with every species of profligacy and corruption,
a total pravity of manners would ensue, and this
must be attended with bankruptcy and ruin. He
observed of the parliament, that the practice of
buying boroughs, and canvassing for votes, was an
avowed system of venality, already established on
the ruins of principle, integrity, faith, and good
order, in consequence of which the elected and the
elector, and, in short, the whole body of the people,
were equally and universally contaminated and
corrupted. He affirmed, that of a parliament thus
constituted, the crown would always have influence
enough to secure a great majority in its dependence,
from the great number of posts, places, and pensions
it had to bestow; that such a parliament would
(as it had already done) lengthen the term of its sitting
and authority, whenever the prince should 

think it for his interest to continue the representatives; 
for without doubt, they had the same right
to protract their authority ad infinitum, as they had
to extend it from three to seven years —With a
parliament, therefore, dependent upon the crown,
devoted to the prince, and supported by a standing
army, garbled and modelled for the purpose, any
king of England may, and probably some ambitious
sovereign will, totally overthrow all the bulwarks
of the constitution; for it is not to be supposed
that a prince of a high spirit will tamely submit
to be thwarted in all his measures, abused and
insulted by a populace of unbridled ferocity, when
he has it in his power to crush all opposition under
his feet with the concurrence of the legislature. 
He said, he should always consider the liberty of
the press as a national evil, while it enabled the vilest
reptile to soil the lustre of the most shining merit,
and furnished the most infamous incendiary
with the means of disturbing the peace, and destroying
the good order of the community. He owned,
however, that, under due restrictions, it would
be a valuable privilege; but affirmed, that at present
there was a no law in England sufficient to restrain
it within proper bounds, 
With respect to juries, he expressed himself to
this effect: —Juries are generally composed of illiterate
plebeians, apt to be mistaken, easily misled,
and open to sinister influence; for if either of the
parties to be tried, can gain over one of the twelve
jurors, he has secured the verdict in his favour; 
the jurymen thus brought over, will, in despight of
all evidence and conviction, generally hold out till
his fellows are fatigued, and harassed, and starved
into concurrence; in which case the verdict is unjust,
and the jurors are all perjured: but cases will
often occur, when the jurors are really divided in
opinion, and each side is convinced in opposition to 

the other; but no verdict will be received, unless
they are unanimous, and they are all bound, not
only in conscience, but by oath, to judge and declare
according to their conviction. —What then will be
the consequence? —They must either starve in
company, or one side must sacrifice their conscience
to their convenience, and join in a verdict
which they believe to be false. This absurdity is
avoided in Sweden, where a bare majority is sufficient; 
and in Scotland, where two thirds of the
jury are required to concur in the verdict. 
You must not imagine that all these deductions
were made on his part, without contradiction on
mine—No—the truth is, I found myself piqued in
point of honour, at his pretending to be so much
wiser than his neighbours. —I questioned all his
assertions, started innumerable objections, argued
and wrangled with uncommon perseverance, and
grew very warm, and even violent in the debate. — 
Sometimes he was puzzled, and once or twice, I
think, fairly refuted; but from those falls he rose
again, like Antæus, with redoubled vigour, till at
length I was tired, exhausted, and really did not
know how to proceed, when luckily he dropped a
hint, by which he discovered he had been bred to
the law; a confession which enabled me to retire
from the dispute with a good grace, as it could not
be supposed that a man like me, who had been bred
to nothing, should be able to cope with a veteran
in his own profession. I believe, however, that I
shall for some time continue to chew the cud of
reflection upon many observations which this original
discharged. 
Whether our sister Tabby was really struck with
his conversation, or is resolved to throw at every
thing she meets in the shape of a man, till she can
fasten the matrimonial noose, certain it is, she has
taken desperate strides towards the affection of Lismahago, 

who cannot be said to have met her half
way, tho' he does not seem altogether insensible to
her civilities —She insinuated more than once how
happy we should be to have his company through
that part of Scotland which we proposed to visit,
till at length he plainly told us, that his road was
totally different from that which we intended to
take; that, for his part, his company would be of
very little service to us in our progress, as he was
utterly unacquainted with the country, which he
had left in his early youth, consequently, he could
neither direct us in our inquiries, nor introduce us
to any family of distinction. He said, he was stimulated
by an irresistible impulse to revisit the paternus
lar, or patria domus, though he expected
little satisfaction, inasmuch as he understood that
his nephew, the present possessor, was but ill qualified
to support the honour of the family. —He
assured us, however, as we design to return by the
west road, that he will watch our motions, and
endeavour to pay his respects to us at Dumsries. 
—Accordingly he took his leave of us at a place
half way betwixt Morpeth and Alnwick, and
pranced away in great state, mounted on a tall,
meagre, raw-boned, shambling grey gelding, without
e'er a tooth in his head, the very counter-part
of the rider; and, indeed, the appearance of the
two was so picturesque, that I would give twenty
guineas to have them tolerably represented on
canvas. 
Northumberland is a fine county, extending to
the Tweed, which is a pleasant pastoral stream; 
but you will be surprised when I tell you that the
English side of that river is neither so well cultivated
nor so populous as the other. —The farms are
thinly scattered, the lands uninclosed, and scarce a
gentleman's seat is to be seen in some miles from
the Tweed; whereas the Scots are advanced in 

crowds to the very brink of the river, so that you
may reckon above thirty good houses, in the compass
of a few miles, belonging to proprietors whose
ancestors had fortified castles in the same situations,
a circumstance that shews what dangerous
neighbours the Scots must have formerly been to
the northern counties of England. 
Our domestic oeconomy continues on the old
footing —My sister Tabby still adheres to methodism,
and had the benefit of a sermon at Wesley's
meeting in Newcastle; but I believe the passion of
love has in some measure abated the fervour of
devotion both in her and her woman, Mrs. Jenkins,
about whose good graces there has been a violent
contest betwixt my nephew's valet, Mr. Dutton,
and my man, Humphry Clinker. —Jery has
been obliged to interpose his authority to keep the
peace; and to him, I have left the discussion of
that important affair, which had like to have kindled
the flames of discord in the family of 
Yours always,
