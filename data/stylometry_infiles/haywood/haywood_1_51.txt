CHAP. I.

Relates only such things, as the reader may
reasonably expect would happen. 

I
CHAP. II.

Contains only some few particulars of little moment
in themselves, but serve to usher in matters of
mone importance. 

12
CHAP. III.

Has somewhat more business in it than the
former. 

27
CHAP. IV.

If it were not for some few particulars, might as
well be passed over as read. 

39
CHAP. V.

Seems to be calculated rather for the instruction
than entertainment of the reader. 

51

CHAP. VI.

Shews the different operations of the same passion,
in persons of different principles and dispositions. 

65
CHAP. VII.

May be called an appendix to the former, as it
contains only some passages subsequent to the preceding
occurrences. 

82
CHAP. VIII.

Is more full of business than entertainment. 

95
CHAP. IX.

Contains very little to the purpose. 

106
CHAP. X.

Contains an account of some transactions, which
though they may not be very pleasing in the repetition,
nor are of any great consequence to
miss Betsy, would render this history extremely
deficient, if omitted. 

121
CHAP. XI.

Is very well deserving the attention of all those
who are about to marry. 

131
CHAP. XII.

Miss Betsy's innocence, as to the Denham affair,
fully cleared up to mr. Trueworth, by a very extraordinary
accident. 

143

CHAP. XIII.

Seems to promise a very great change for the better,
both in the humour and conduct of miss Betsy,
in regard to those who professed themselves her
lovers. 

154
CHAP. XIV.

Shews that miss Betsy, whenever she pleased to
exert herself, had it in her power to be discreet,
even on occasions the most tempting to her humour
and inclination. 

164
CHAP. XV.

The terrible consequences, which may possibly attend
our placing too great a dependance on persons
whose principles we are not well assured of, are
here exemplified, in a notable act of villany and
hypocrisy. 

180
CHAP. XVI.

Will not tire the reader. 

200
CHAP. XVII.

Love in death,â€”an example rather to be wondered
at than imitated. 

212
CHAP. XVIII.

Displays miss Betsy in her penitentials, and the
manner in which she behaved after having met
with so much matter for the humiliation of her 

vanity, as also some farther particulars, equally
worth the attention of the curious. 

222
CHAP. XIX.

Presents the reader with some occurrences, which
from the foregoing preparations, might be expected,
and also with others that may seem more
surprising. 

238
CHAP. XX.

Contains divers things. 

253
CHAP. XXI.

Presents the reader with some prognostics on events
in futuro. 

265
CHAP. XXII.

Will prove by a remarkable instance of a high
raised hope suddenly disappointed, the extreme
weakness of building our expectations upon
mere conjecture.
