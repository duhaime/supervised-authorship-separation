How little are those blest with a paternal
Protection, able to comprehend
the thousand Dangers which
attend a wandring and unguarded
State of Life! The unhappy Idalia,
accompany'd by that honest goodnatur'd
poor Fellow, who had preserved
her from the Sea, had gone above half her
Journey to Rome without meeting any Opposition; 
but happening to overtake three Gentlemen,
who falling into Discourse with her on the Road,
had told her, they were travelling that Way, she discharg'd
her Guide, as believing she should have no
further need of him. Her Men's Clothes, which
she became exceeding well, she thought was Security
enough from any of those Insults she had of late
been so terrify'd with, and the Company of these 

Gentlemen from the Danger of losing her Way, or
any other Inconvenience. But, alas! as much as she
imagined she knew of the World, and as great a Variety
of Adventures as she had gone through, she
was now entring into a Misfortune she had not the
least Notion of: She had not parted from her Conducter
above a quarter of an Hour, before her new
Companions began to ask her, what her Business was
at Rome; how far she had travelled; the Names of
her Parents; and a thousand other impertinent Questions,
which she was not a little puzzled in what
Manner to answer: But she thought there was no
great Occasion for disguising the Story of her Shipwreck,
therefore gave them a brief Account of that; 
and as to the rest of their Enquires, only told them,
That her Design was for Naples, but having suffered
so much by the Uncertainty of the Weather, she
chose rather to take so long a Journey by Land, than
trust any more to the Mercy of the Sea. They did
not seem satisfy'd with this Reply, but press'd her
very much to let them know to what Study she had
been bred. You appear, said one of them, to be a very
pretty Youth; I cannot think you are of Quality,
because you are without an Equipage, therefore must
imagine your Education has been either for the Gown,
or the Army. Doubtless it is so, added the other, and
you have no Reason to conceal the Truth of your Affairs
from us, who probably may be of Service to you. 
Ay, resumed he that spoke first, that we may, provided
he has but Resolution. Hark ye, (continued he,
looking on Idalia,) can you handle Arms? ––––Have
you ever learn'd to Fence? ––––Interrogatories like these
took from her all Capacity of answering! She grew
both terrified and amazed, though she knew not the
Cause, till one of them, who seemed to be the fiercest,
gave her to understand they were of those who were
called the Banditti, and that if she would consent to
list herself among them, she would never want for any
Thing. At this Information it was as much as she
could do to keep herself from fainting away; but 

summoning all the little Spirit she had left, at last she
had Courage to tell them, she had neither need, nor
was fit for any such Employ: But that she thank'd
them for their kind Intentions; and endeavoured to
make her Refusal as civil as she could, fearing, and
not without Reason, that Men who lived as they did,
were not of a Humour to endure Plain-dealing. But
all she could say, palliated not the Biterness of her first
Words, so much as to engage them to forgive the
Contempt with which they found themselves treated; 
and one of them looking on his Fellow, presently
cry'd, Damn the little saucy Rascal, let us stick him
against a Tree. ––––No, (replied the other, who seem'd
something more pitiful,) let the foolish Boy live to repent
his refusing so good an Offer; 'tis not worth our
Trouble to kill him. Well then, said the first, we'll
see what a Stock of Money he has that makes him so
Proud; and since he thinks himself above societing with
us, he shall help to support us without his Company. 
Ay, ay, rejoin'd the other, with all my Heart. 
Poor Idalia was too much frighted all this while
to be able to utter one Word more, though by it she
had been sure to save both her Life, and that which
was now almost as precious to her, that little Money
which had been raised on the last Thing she had of
Value in the World, but suffered herself to be stripp'd
of it without either entreating, or complaining. After
they had ransacked her Pockets, they contented
themselves with what they found there, and killing
the Beast she rode on, (to prevent her making any
Pursuit after them, in case any Persons should chance
to come that Way, and join with her in it,) left her
to get to Rome as she could. 
It was some Time before the Terror this Accident
had put her in, gave her leave even to reflect on
the Misfortune that was befallen her; but when she
did, scarce any Thing could seem more dreadful to
her: Had they not destroyed her Horse, she might
have hoped either to have found her Way to Rome,
or some other Town, from whence she might have 

writ to Venice for a Supply; but to travel on Foot,
was little agreeable to the Weakness and Delicacy of
her Sex and Constitution: Besides, to be entirely destitute
of Money in a Place so altogether unknown,
was what might have shocked a Courage infinitely
exceeding her's. She vented some Part of the Anguish
of her Soul in Tears, but they unavailing to help her
forward in her Journey, and the Necessity there was
of prosecuting it, she at length rose from the Ground
she had been sitting on, and began her weary Pilgrimage; 
the Thoughts of which, and the little Probability
there was she should ever be able to go through
it, render'd her yet more uncapable. She went on
a slow Pace, yet too fast for her to continue long, and
her Strength and Spirits failing, a thousand tormenting
Considerations all at once assaulting her, Despair,
which the natural Chearfulness of her Disposition
had so often repelled, now seiz'd on her whole Soul; 
she yielded to the black Idea of her Woe, and thinking
it vain to struggle any more against the o'erpowering
Tide of strong Afflicton, suffer'd herself to
be born away with it, and for some Moments lost
the Pain of Thought. –––She was stretched at her
Length in a kind of Slumber, or rather Fit, by the
side of a little Stream which ran through a Meadow
in sight of the great Road: Her Hat, when she lay
down, had fallen off her Head, and her delicate Hair
was blown by the Wind to and fro, now shading,
now disclosing all her lovely Face to the Sun's burning
View, who, if capable of those Desires which
Poets have described him with, must have forsaken
his Car, and stoop'd to be more blest than Daphne,
had she been kind, could ever have made him. 
It was in this Love and Pity-moving Posture
she was discovered by a Lady; who passing by in her
Chariot had seen something lie at that Distance, and
had Curiosity enough to alight and walk to the
Place where she was. ––––But when she beheld the
Features of the beautiful Idalia, which neither the Fatague,
nor Fright, nor Grief she had endured could 

render unlovely, she began to feel a Trembling at her
Heart, which she was too well acquainted with, not
to comprehend: But not being of a Humour to constrain
her Inclinations, indulged the growing Flame
by gazing on, till the seeming Chevalier beginning a
little to recover, looking up with Astonishment to
see a Lady of a most dazzling Appearance, and attended
by a Number of Servants in a Place where but
a Moment before (as she imagined) she had been alone,
and without Hope of meeting any Body, had such
an additional Charm to what her sleeping Graces
wore, that the already enflamed Lady, taking her for
what her Dress bespoke her, was now half mad with
wild Desires; but endeavouring to conceal her Sentiments
from the Observation of her Servants, she
turned to them, and being of a ready Invention, presently
told them, that lovely Youth was one of her
near Relations, and she supposed by some Villany
had been betray'd, and left there in that Manner. Idalia
was enough come to herself to hear what she
said, but had not Presence of Mind at that Juncture to
determine how she should behave: At first she thought
of discovering her Sex, believing it might be an Inducement
to one of the same to afford her some Reliet; 
but her speaking in that Manner to her Attendants,
prevented her, and she remained silent, as not
being able to guess what 'twas she meant, till the Lady
asking her how she came to be alone; and in a
Disorder which was visible in her Face, she told her
she had been in the Hands of Robbers, who had left
her nothing but her Life. Thank Heaven for that,
said the enamoured Lady, all other Misfortunes may
be redeem'd; and since I know you are a great Way from
your own Home, be pleas'd to accept of mine for some
time: My House is not above three Miles distant from
hence; I have a Chariot waits, and you shall go with
me to take that Repose which the Condition I find you
in seems to require. Idalia had not the Power of answering
her any otherwise than with a low Bow, so
much had one Surprise on the Back of another depriv'd 

her of her wonted Readiness of Apprehension; 
but thinking whatever Design this unknown Lady
had, either in the Civilities she shew'd her, or the
Tale she had invented of her being a Relation, it could
not be any Thing to her Prejudice, or if it were, it
was still shifting the Scene of Vexation, which to the
Wretched is some Ease, she gave her Hand, and suffered
her to lead her to the Chariot; where as soon as they
were seated, I perceive, said the Lady, that you are surpris'd
at what I told my Servants; but it was a
Stratagem which my Prudence inspir'd me with: My
Pity to see a Person of your Appearance in so dejected
a Posture, first led me to a Resolution to remedy your
Misfortunes, if it be in my Power; and the Regard
every Woman ought to have for her Reputation, join'd
to the common Safety of us both, to make you pass as
a Relation, lest at the Return of my Husband, who is
now Absent, and will be for some Days, my Behaviour
should be reported to him in a different Manner
from what I would have it. ––––There is, continued
she, a curs'd Necessity in Wedlock, which obliges one
sometimes to disguise the Truth, and for that Reason
Fools should never Marry. These Words, and the
Air which accommpany'd them, made the pretended
Chevalier guess to what Motive she was indebted
for this unexpected Relief, and in spite of the
various Disquiets which possess'd her, could scarce forbear
smiling to herself at the Oddness of such an Adventure; 
but thinking it could not be to her Detriment
to humour the Caprice, and having too well
been acquainted with what Men say on those Occasions,
answered her in Terms which were infinitely
obliging to her. Donna Antonia, (for that was
the Name of this Lady) already began to flatter herself
with a Belief she was secure of the Heart of
this young Charmer; and free from all those Fears
which generally are the Companions of Love, talk'd
all the Way with as much Familiarity as tho' their
Acquaintance had bore the Date of many as Years as
it did of Minutes: But desiring to be inform'd of the 

Name and Quality of her Lover, our little Hero presently
told her, That though there were some Reasons
which obliged him to conceal himself, yet that he
should make no Scruple of letting her know both
who he was, and why he left the Place of his Birth:
And then related a long Account, which she form'd
in the speaking, that she was born at Verona of one of
the most noble Families in the Place; but, having
the Misfortune to kill in a Duel a Son of one of the
Magistrates, was obliged to fly till the Affair could
be made up. This, Madam, said the counterfeit Don,
is my History, nor have I any Thing farther to inform
you of, than that in my Way to Rome I met some of
the Banditti, who have plundered me of all the ready
Money, Jewels, and Bills, I had about me, leaving me
in the Condition in which your Compassion found me,
without any Thing to recommend me to your Care,
but a Heart entirely free from all Engagements except
those which the Influence of your Charms has made. 
In fine, the little Gallant address'd in a Fashion so agreeble
to the Sex she imitated, that it was no Wonder
Donna Antonia was both deceived and charmed
with it. When they came to the End of their Journey,
they alighted at the Gate of a magnificent Dwelling,
which being open'd, our young Adventurer was
conducted in with all imaginable Ceremony; a fine
Collation was immediately set forth, where the richest
Wines, choicest Fruits, and extravagant Kindness
of the fair Inviter, strove which most should please
the beloved Guest: But, alas! whatever Smiles her
Face might be constrain'd to wear, her Heart felt little
Satisfaction in all the Splendor she saw about her,
and the Welcome she found: She long'd with the
utmost Impatience to be alone, and at liberty to indulge
a Melancholy she had but too just a Cause for; 
and pretending to be still out of Order with the late
Fatigue, entreated she might retire. Antonia willing
to oblige her Favorite in all Things, deny'd herself
the Pleasure of his Conversation to allow him that of 

his Repose, and ordered him to be shewed to a
Chamber, one of the noblest in the House. 
IDALIA had been so much accustomed to the Vicissitudes
of Fortune, that she was less astonish'd at this,
than probably another would have been: But it serv'd
very much to encrease the Perplexities she was in. 
She knew not whether to consider it as a good or
ill Chance: To be relieved from the Fear of perishing
in so miserable a Manner as that of Want, she
could not but acknowledge as a peculiar Mark of the
Care of an All-seeing Providence; but then the Passion,
which the Mistake of her Sex had inspir'd in the Person
ordain'd to be her Deliverer, she thought an Omen
of something fatal to her, though she could by no
means form any Conjecture by what Means. Full
of melancholy Reflections of the Dangers, the Terrors,
the Disappointments she had met, and those
which in all likelihood she was yet to encounter, she
fancied she regretted the unaccountable Obstacles which
had hitherto hindred her from a monastick Life, the
most of any Misfortune she had gone through; but,
alas! how little was she capable of judging of her own
Soul! –––The Remembrance of Myrtano's Charms,––– 
the swelling Transports whenever Imagination presented
him to her, with those tender Wishes in his
Eyes, which often she had read there,––––the Horror
which invaded her, when she reflected on his Infidelity,
––––would soon have made her sensible in any
other's Case, that it was to the Temple of Love the
chiefest of her Orisons were directed, and Religion
had but the second Place. But however it were, never
Woman endured more through the working of so
many different Passions; and it was the Confusion of
her Thoughts alone that render'd her incapable of
forming, much less of keeping any Resolution Reason
should suggest. It certainly had been the most
prudent, as well as most honourable Part, to have confess'd
herself a Woman to Donna Antonia; but the
Uncertainty what she should do, or where to retreat,
if by that Discovery she should forfeit her Protection, 

deterr'd her from it. The Perturbations of her Mind,
which hinder'd her from closing her Eyes all Night,
the vast Fatigue she had endur'd in walking so much
beyond her Strength, together with a Cold she had
got by lying on the Grass, threw her into a Fever; 
which as soon as Antonia was inform'd of by the Servant
whom she sent with a Good-morrow, she ordered
a Physician immediately to give his Attendance; all
imaginable Care was taken, nor could there have been
more, had the Welfare of the whole World depended
on this single Life. ––––What Zeal, what Caution,
what Tenderness, does Love inspire, when alarmed
with the least Danger of losing the beloved Object! 
Antonia would needs be present at every Prescription,
trusted no Hand but her own to mingle up the Medicines,
watch'd herself by the Bedside, and chid the
tardy Nurse's Sloth, listen'd to every Groan, and answer'd
them with Sighs. Never did the fondest Wife,
the tenderest Mother, or most dutiful Child, with
such unfeigned Concern, such interested Hopes and
Fears, alternate Joy and Terror, every Day, almost
every Hour, receive the different Sentiments which
the Physicians gave, according as the Distemper abated
or encreas'd. For several Days no settled Judgment
could be made of Life or Death; but at last, the
Strength of Nature in so young a Person, joined
to the extraordinary Care and Skill which had
been us'd, o'crcame the Malignity of the Disease, and
she was transported with the News, that her dear
Cousin (for so she call'd the feign'd Chevalier) was
entirely out of Danger. 
But this Indisposition had made a very great Alteration
in the Sentiments of Idalia; for as before
she but fancy'd she wish'd for a Recluse Life, she now
in reality began to do so; with her bodily Strength,
her Passions were now debilitated, the Noise and Hurry
of the World were now in good earnest odious
to her, and Love itself, though not wholly extinguish'd,
burned with a dim and feeble Fire: The
Duties of Religion, and a true Repentance for the 

Mismanagement and Follies of her past Life, now
took up all her Thoughts; and as she was of a Disposition
generous enough, when Vanity, Pride, or Love,
did not oversway her, she resolved to undeceive Antonia,
and use the utmost of her Endeavours to perswade
her to turn the Current of her Affections,
where both the Laws of God and Man required them,
and henceforward banish all Desire but for her Husband. 
She had just fix'd herself in this pious Resolution,
when Antonia came into the Chamber; and before she
could have an Opportunity of executing it, told her, the
Reason she had absented herself so long, (for she had
not been there in some Hours,) was, That her Husband
was returned from Viterbo, where he had been
some Time before her Arrival, and that in Decency
she had been oblig'd to Dine with him; but having
told him, she had a near Relation in the House, he
desir'd, if it was not inconsistent with his Repose,
to be admitted to visit him. What Idalia had to say
would have taken up more Time than could now be
spar'd; besides, she was willing to see what the Person
and Behaviour of this Gentleman would allow her
to say in his Favour, before she attempted to work
any Change in the Sentiments of his Wife: Therefore
only telling her she should receive the Favour he
intended her with that Pleasure which became one
so much oblig'd, Antonia took her Leave with a
Smile, which testified it was not to him he had been
obliged, and immediately returned accompanied by
her Husband. 
IDALIA, by reason of her Weakness, still kept
her Bed, but was supported by Pillows in such a Manner,
that she rather sat than lay: She had compos'd
her Mind as much as possible, that she might be the
better able to make a Judgment of this Gentleman. 
But how immediately was it o'erthrown!––––how,
in an Instant, was all the Sedateness she had assum'd
chang'd into Confusion, Shame, Horror, Distraction,
when the Moment they enter'd the Room she saw
the Husband of Antonia was no other than Myrtano! 

What Words can represent, what Heart conceive
what hers endured at this so unexpected, so shocking
a View! A thousand Furies all at once possess'd her,
chill Fear and burning Rage, wild Jealousy and mad
Despair, and Thought-disjointing Amazement, with
all the black Ideas they could raise, crowed into her
Soul. ––––Of all the surprising Accidents of her unhappy
Life, nothing is more to be wondered at, than
that she survived this dreadful Moment, or at least did
not by some Extravagance discover both her Sex, and
the Cause of her Distraction: But though her Eyes
shot perfect Fires, and seem'd to start from forth
their glowing Orbs,––––her Lips trembled, her Hair
stood an end as though some some Spectre had met
her Sight, and every Limb was shook with inward
Agonies, yet she neither spoke, nor acted any Thing
which could give the Standers-by the liberty of guessing
from what Cause the Alteration they beheld had
sprung. Antonia appeared infinitely troubled to find
so sudden a Change, which she looked on as a Relapse
into that Distemper which had given her so many
Fears; and Myrtano's Good-Nature and Complaisance
oblig'd him to join in her Concern. They
stay'd not above a Moment or two, Myrtano easily
perceived the Stranger was not in a Condition to endure
Company, and Antonia ran instantly away to
send for the Physician. 
Had they stay'd longer, 'tis probable indeed she
might not have had the Power of preserving herself
undiscovered; for it was not to any Presence of
Mind that her Reserve was owing, but to the too
great Multitude of various Emotions, which, warring
with each other in her Bosom, would not suffer
her to utter any. ––––She fell into a Swoon the
Moment they left the Room, and by that Means
was very near discover'd to the old Nurse that
attended her, that her Patient was not of the Sex she
pretended to be; for after rubbing her Temples, and
applying Things to her Nostrils, she was about to
open her Linnen Wastecoat, which she had always 

wore close button'd, just as she recovered: But her
ill Genius had prevailed so far over her good one, as
not to suffer the Discovery to be made in a Manner
so little to her Prejudice, as also to prolong her Life,
to experience more Misery: In spite of her Weakness,
in spite of the additional Torments the Sight of Myrtano,
as Husband of Antonia, had inflicted on her,
she grew better every Day, and in a Week's Time
was able to walk about her Chamber: All which
Time she was visited several Times in a Day by the
fair Wife of Don Myrtano, who in spite of the Caution
she had of giving him any Suspicion of her Inclinations,
could not forbear gratifying them so far
as to come as often as she could get an Opportunity,
to look upon her Soul's Ador'd. But the Sentiments
of Idalia were now entirely chang'd again; she no
longer thought it proper to make herself be known,
nor could find in her Heart to use any Endeavours for
the Conversion of Antonia; she rather wished her Indifference
for him might encrease; for since she
knew her to be a Rival, and a Rival possess'd of all
those Joys she once had vainly hoped, not all the good
Offices she had done her could hinder her from regarding
her with a mortal Hatred. ––––Him too she
hated, or she imagin'd at that Time she did so; and
if in the wild Tumults of her troubled Thoughts she
ever was compos'd enough to pray, it was only to
invoke Heaven to revenge her Wrongs, and curse
them both with lasting Discord and eternal Strife. 
All the Time of her keeping her Chamber, Myrtano
had never offered to visit her since the first Time; 
at which she was not a little astonished, and began to
fear that even in that transient View he had seen enough
through her Disguise to know her; and conscious of
the Injustice he had been guilty of to her, was asham'd
to meet the Reproaches of her Eyes. ––––Antonia was
also surprised, but would not press it, nor ask the
Reason of his Neglect, least he should imagine her, as
she was, too far interested in it; and having by his
Absence greater Opportunities of entertaining her Beloved, 

did not much perplex herself about finding out the
Meaning of his allowing her to do so. She was infinitely
more concern'd, that the Darling of her
Wishes had made so small a Return to her Advances:
The seeming Youth had behaved himself with so
much Gallantry the Day she brought him home,
that she expected an immediate Declaration of Affection
would have ensued. All the Time of his Sickness
she had no other Fear than to be deprived of
her Desires by Death; but now, when she perceiv'd
him perfectly past Danger, she found herself farther
from the Possession of them than ever she had believ'd
herself; and one Day being alone in the Chamber
with him, could no longer contain the furious
Ardour with which she was possess'd, but not only
by her Words, but also Actions, endeavour'd to make
the dear Ungrateful sensible how much she had suffer'd
from his Coldness. 
IDALIA, who hated her before for being the
Wife of Myrtano, now despis'd and scorn'd her; the
endearing Expressions with which she was treated by
her, made her appear more odious; and wholly unguarded
by the Multiplicity of her Reflections, before
she was aware, flinging away, and stamping, Gods! 
Gods! cried she, is this a Woman for Myrtano to love? 
She had no sooner spoke these Words, than he rush'd
into the Room with his Sword drawn, and had certainly
prevented her from ever saying more, if his
Wife, as much surpris'd as she was, had not been
quick enough to prevent him, by catching fast hold
of his Arm, and continuing to hang upon it, notwithstanding
all his Endeavours to throw her off; Begone,
perfidious Woman, said he furiously, unless you wish to
perish, with your Minion, a Victim to your shameful
Passion. Is it not enough that you conspir'd the Death
of her who alone was worthy of my Love, but you must
add Adultery to your Design of Murder? ––––You know
I am not ignorant of your monstrous,––––your more than
brutal Disposition:––––How dare you then to tempt me
thus, lest I should take a full Revenge for all my Wrongs 

at once? I never, never wrong'd you, (interrupted she, still
clinging fast about him:) If I contriv'd my Rival's
Death, 'twas Love of you that was the Cause, inhuman
Man as you are to upbraid me with it. And was
it Love of me (resum'd he, more violently) that induc'd
you to court this Stranger, whom falsly you would
have pass'd on me for a Relation? ––––But I have been
inform'd of all, and will have Reparation. In speaking
these Words, he us'd his utmost Force to disengage
himself, and having done it, ran fiercely at Idalia;
which she perceiving, evaded the Blow by falling on
her Knees; and imagining something by the Reproaches
which in his Indignation he had made his
Wife, prevented him from lifting up his Hand against
her, by crying out to him, Hold, hold, Don Myrtano,
I conjure you spare my Life till you shall know who 'tis
you are about to destroy, and till you satisfy me who
that Lady was, your Wife so cruelly design'd to murder. 
What is that to thee? (resum'd he, vex'd that he had
mention'd that before him.) Oh! 'tis of more Moment,
(answer'd she,) perhaps, to you and me, than yet you
comprehend:––––For Heaven's sake then, and for your
own, indulge my Curiosity in this Request, and tell me,
if the Lady destin'd to fall a Sacrifice to you and Love
was not call'd Idalia? ––––Both the Husband and the
Wife started from their Places they stood, in at the
Mention of that Name, as tho' a Clap of Thunder
had pronounced it; but the former looking earnestly
in the Face of the Person that spoke it for the space of
two or three Minutes, found something there that dissipated
great Part of the Fury that he had been in: The
Air, the Features, and the Voice of Idalia were too
deeply imprinted in his Memory not to be distinguish'd
thro' all Disguises. Immediately he knew her,
and regardless of his Wife's Presence, flew to her,
and caught her in his Arms, and cried in an Extasy
which no false Lover could feign, It is, it is Idalia,
my only everlasting Charmer. 
It was impossible for a Woman, who lov'd with
that Transcendency of Passion, to be thus claps'd, 

yet feel no Satisfaction in the tender Pressure: Not all
the Resentment she had against him for his marrying
another, had Power to make her resist his Embraces; 
but as soon as he had given them Truce, which he did
only to gratify his Sight with another View of her
dear well-known Face, as he had done his Touch in
holding her to his Bosom, she recollected herself enough
to remove some few Steps from him; and looking
on him with a Countenance as severe as she had
Power to put on,––––I was satisfied you should know
who I am, (said she,) because you should be sensible
how little your Wife has been capable of wronging you
in the Manner your jealous Fury had suggested; but desire
not, as you are now another's, any Testimonies of
that former Affection which was between us, which
you have forfeited, and I am willing to forget, since
the Remembrance would be as great a Crime in me,
as that you lately suspected her guilty of. He was
just going to reply, when Donna Antonia, who
had all this while been unable, by reason of her Surprise,
to discharge any Part of the Rage she was full
of, stepping hastily between them, cried, And are
you Idalia? Yes, (answer'd she, not at all daunted at
the Fury she saw in her Countenance;) and I imagine
you are the Neice of Count Miramont. 'Tis probable
here might have follow'd a Combat of Words,
the War of Women, if Don Myrtano had not put an
End to it. Madam, (said he to his Wife, in a Voice
nothing soften'd from that in which he had spoke
to her before,) tho' I am assur'd no Injury could here be
done me, yet your Intentions were the same. My own
Ears heard you declare a Passion shameful to your Sex
and Character; but it is hereafter that I shall tell you
my Sentiments on this Affair. In the mean Time I
command you, by that Power the Name of Husband
gives me, (and which your forfeiting all Title either
to my Love or Respect obliges me to make use of) to
retire to your own Apartment, and wait my Coming. 
This, (continued he more sternly, perceiving her not
about to go,) if you refuse to obey, I will this Moment 

make Complaints of your Behaviour to the Pope, and
lay before him the whole Scene of your Proceedings. 
Of as haughty and impatient a Disposition as Antonia
was, this Menace exacted her Compliance; and she
left the Room, only casting a Look back on Idalia,
which spoke, more plainly than a thousand Words
could do, the Violence of her Rage. 
The Reader will easily imagine, that after she was
gone, Don Myrtano addressed his long-lost Charmer
with all the soft Endearments suitable to so surprising
an Occasion; but she, who was not willing to yeild
to the Pleasure she took in hearing them, and withal
desirous to be inform'd by what means Donna Antonia
had known her to have been her Rival, it being
a Secret she believ'd to all in Venice, and also if
it were really she who had brib'd the unknown Person
to murder her in the Forest, let him know it
would be more satisfactory to her to be let into what
he knew of these Affairs, than all he could say on
any other. He was too glad of an Opportunity,
which, while he obliged her in the Grant of her Request,
would also clear him of his suspected Infidelity,
to let it slip; and engaging her to sit down by
him, while he fulfilled her Commands, began to unravel
a Mystery, which had appeared so confounding
to her Understanding, in these Words: 
The History of Don Myrtano, and Don Honorius dell Miramont.
You may remember, Madam! (said he, sighing,)
doubtless with an Infinity of Indignation
remember, that the last Time I ever had the Blessing
of seeing you at Vicenza, I receiv'd not the Honour
you then vouchsafed me, of assuring me you would
not refuse to be mine, when ever I should claim you
by Ways you should approve, and as became a Man
worthy of the adorable Idalia's Affection: But, oh!
had you been sensible what I endur'd in the severe 

Necessity of appearing so ungrateful, so stupid, so
blind to the inestimable Happiness that Condescension
offer'd me, you would rather Pity than condemn
me:––––I had, when I was very young, been
contracted by my Parents to Donna Antonia dell
Miramont, she who is now my Wife; and who, being
bred here at Rome, I had never seen: But a former
Intimacy between our Families was the Occasion
of this, which I must now call unhappy Union. 
For my part, as I had a Heart entirely unprepossessed,
I agreed to it without any manner of Reluctance,
but had not Complaisance enough to take a
Journey to visit her: The Count her Uncle, perhaps,
imagining the Sight of her might engage me to hasten
the Consummation of the Contract, sent her to
Venice with an Equipage and Train proportion'd to
the Fondness he had for her. At her Arrival I
thought her very agreeable to what I then wish'd for
in a Wife, and indeed lik'd her better than any Lady
I had seen; nay, I really loved her enough to be impatient
for the Celebration of the Nuptials, and accordingly
ordered every Thing to be prepared for it. 
The Day was appointed; and it was that in which
my unhappy Brother and Don Ferdinand fell Rival
Victims to Love and your Almighty Charms. Decency
forbad the Hymeneal Torch should mingle with
the Funeral Taper, and the Wedding by Consent of
both Parties was deferr'd. A fatal Curiosity inclining
me to see those Eyes, those lovely Orbs of shining
Ruin, I no longer thought Antonia worth my Care; 
but I need not tell you how much I lov'd, how
much I ador'd an Excellence so far beyond all that
ever was called Mortal, a thousand, thousand Times
you have read it in my Eyes! ––––These glowing
burning Balls, which never gaz'd upon you without
starting, and almost breaking the Strings which held
them with Extasy unspeakable!––––with Pleasure
wound up to such a Height of racking Rapture, that
it even became a Pain, and stagger'd Sense! ––––O
what would I not then have given to have had it in 

my Power to offer you a Passion worthy of your
Acceptance! ––––How did I curse my Engagement
with Antonia? ––––How many Stratagems did I invent
to break with her? But she, better acquainted
with the Secret of my Soul than at that Time I imagined,
artfully evaded my Excuses, and circumvented
me in all, either because she then had really an Affection
for me, or, as 'tis most probable by her Conduct since,
thought it would be a Reflection on the Power of her
Beauty to have it said, she had come so far to marry a Man
who on any Terms could be brought to forsake her. –––– 
In fine, let me do what I would, say what I would,
she seem'd not to resent it; and render'd it an Impossibility
for me to quit her, without making myself
appear the most ungrateful and perfidious of Mankind. 
––––I was in this perplexing Dilemma, when you
made Tryal of my Faith, by proposing what I would
have given my Soul to have had it in my Power
to accept. ––––I am sure you cannot forget the Confusion
which was too visible in my Countenance
not to be observed, which perhaps you might impute
to another Score, but was really occasioned only by
the inward working of my tumultuous Desires, which
long'd with an Ardency inexpressible to satisfy you in
a Demand which would have been so glorious for
me; yet I knew not how I should effect it, though
a Multitude of Inventions crowded that Moment at
once into my Head, and flatter'd me with some little
Hopes. ––––I went, you know, immediately away; 
which haste proceeded from my Impatience to return
with Tydings more suitable to my Passion to
bring, than any I had yet been able to tell you. –––– 
Alas! I little thought 'twould be so long before we
met again, nor of the Treachery which was then in
Agitation to separate us for ever:––––But of that hereafter.–––– 
When I had put in Execution all the Stratagems
my Passion for you inspired me with, and found
them fruitless to work the Effect I wish'd,––––I had
no longer Patience, but resolved at my next Visit to 

disclose to you the whole History of my Misfortune:
On the Road to Vicenza, about four Miles distant
from my own Villa, I saw a Horse standing still; and
looking down on a Person who lay on the Ground
by him, I presently imagin'd it was somebody who
had either suffer'd by a Fall from that Horse, or the
Villany of some Robbers: But drawing nearer to offer
what Assistance was in the Power of myself or
Servants to afford, I heard him utter most piteous
Lamentations, mixed with Groans. ––––Both Christianity
and common Compassion obliges those of the
highest Rank of Life to do what good Offices they
can, even to the meanest; and though this Man appeared
to be one of those, I should have thought it a
Pride no way commendable to have trusted the Relief
of his Misery to any Care but my own: I immediately
alighted, and raising him a little, presently
discover'd, (to my great Surprise, to find him in such
a Posture and Habit) the Face of Don Honorius dell
Miramont, the Brother of Antonia, and without Exception,
a Chevalier of the most Perfections I ever
found in Man. 
IDALIA could not here forbear interrupting him,
to let him know he might spare himself the Trouble
of giving any Character of that accomplish'd young
Nobleman; for she was perfectly acquainted with
with his Worth, having the Honour of being frequently
in his Company at Venice. 
YES, Madam! (resumed Don Myrtano) I am sensible
you have seen him, and that the Consequence of
such Interviews have been such as you never fail of
causing,–––to inspire a Passion too just to be oppos'd by
Reason, and too violent to suffer any Considerations to
be of force to overcome it. But (continued he) to pursue
the little History I am about to give you, this unhappy
Gentleman, who seemed in Agonies such as seizes
on the Body when the Soul is departing from it, no
sooner cast his Eyes upon me, than he cry'd out, O
Don Myrtano, you come in happy Time to revenge my
Death! ––––I am poisoned!––––the fatal Dose was given 

me by Ardella. ––––A sudden Pang seizing him that
Moment, prevented his saying any more for some
Time; and I, who perceiv'd his Condition was indeed
deplorable, thought it not a Season to talk,
but act, if there were any Means which Art or Nature
could furnish to repel the Malignity of the Poison; 
and immediately dispatched one of my Servants
to Villa Rica for a Litter, and another to Padua, to
order a Physician, who I knew was a most skilful
one, to meet us at Vicenza with all possible Expedition; 
the third, for by good Fortune I had so many
with me, took Care of my Horse while I kneel'd
down by the agoniz'd Honorius, and by holding his
Sides, and sometimes his Head, according to the various
Shootings of his Pain, afforded him some little
Ease. I was impatient to the last Degree, to know
what he meant by saying my Servant Ardella had
given him the Poison, and fancied him to be a little
delirious with the excessive Torture he endured, till
having a little Respite from it, he again said, That it
was she who had administred it to him, but that he very
well knew it was to oblige another she had done
so. These Words gave me Apprehension that he
might imagine it occasioned by my Order, and I was
beginning to protest my Innocence; but he perceiving
my Intent, cry'd out to me to speak no more, for
he was well assured I was both innocent and ignorant
of any such Thing: But, continued he, I know
not if you will afford me any Pity for my Sufferings,
when you shall be told the Injury I have done you:
But we are neither of us exempt from Faults; and you
must pardon me, as you would wish to be forgiven by
those to whom you are guilty of Injustice. ––––There
was something so mysterious in these last Words,
that I could not possibly dive into their Meaning; 
and the Violence of his Pain returning, prevented me
from desiring him to make an Explanation of them,
till another small Cessation happening, he did it of his
own accord in this Manner: 

You must know, said he, that in all her Pride
of Innocence I happened at a Ball to dance with
the admired Idalia, and from that Moment was inspir'd
with a Passion for her, which not all her late
Misfortunes, which have made so great a Noise at
Venice, could eraze. I was just determined to urge
my Suit to Don Bernardo's Ears, when her sudden
Absence from his House prevented me; since which,
though I have searched for her with a Diligence proportioned
to the Love I had for her, I never could
hear the least Tittle to what Place, or with what
happy Man she was retir'd, till my Sister's Jealousy of
you furnished her with Means to inform me, without
knowing, at the same Time, how much she
obliged me in it: But coming one Day to visit her,
I found her drown'd in Tears; which enquiring the
Reason of, she told me, You had of late very much
degenerated from the Affection you once professed,
and which the Engagements between you demanded
the Continuance of. She presently took it in her
Head, that there must be some Rival in the Way; 
and imagining she was either at Vicenza, or near that
Place, because she had observed you past most of your
Time there, contrary to your Custom; and resolving
to satisfy her jealous Curiosity, found out a Method
which nothing but the subtil-working Wit of an impatient
disappointed Woman could suggest: She got
acquainted with a Sister of Ardella's, (who, by some
Accident she had heard, was a sort of Housekeeper to
you at Vicenza,) and by her Means with herself: By
Promises and Bribes she engaged that mercenary
Wench to her Interest, and won the whole Secret
from her of Idalia's having been from the Time she
left Venice a Guest there, first to Don Henriquez, and
afterwards to you. 
Such a Dicovery was, I confess, sufficient to
alarm a Heart much less imperious than Antonia's;
but having as great a Share of Cunning as Pride,
would take not the least Notice to you that she had
any jealous Sentiments, much less that she was appris'd 

of any Thing which could raise them. When
she gave me this Account, she little imagined I had
any further Interest in it, than the Part which Nature
oblig'd me to take for a Sister affronted in this Manner; 
but tho' I was not without that Consideration also,
yet the Affection I had for Idalia, and the Misfortune
I thought it to have her in your Possession, had
infinitely the Pre-eminence, and I presently form'd a
Contrivance of dressing me in the Fashion you see,
and went to Vicenza; where lurking about the House,
I was in hopes of seeing her, or at least hearing something
more than yet I had been informed of. But
Fortune favoured me not so far; I had been there several
Days before any Thing accrued to my Observation:
But what added to my Disquiet the Sight of
you twice entring, and the Imagination what a Prodigality
of Felicity you were going to enjoy in the
Society of Idalia, made me almost wild. But at last
I found an Opportunity of getting into the Company
of Ardella, and by the Character my Sister had
given of her sordid Disposition, knowing which way
to ingratiate myself, made her Presents of some little
Trifles, which I bought of a Fellow who I saw offering
them to Sale: They were such as were suitable to the
Appearance of the Person who gave them, and tho'
of very small Value, were acceptable to this greedy
Creature; and I soon became so great with her, that
I flattered myself I should in a little Time be Master
of the whole Secret of Idalia. Complaining that I
was in Distress for a Lodging while I stay'd at Vicenza,
she made me an Invitation of lying in your House,
till I had finished the Business which I pretended had
brought me to that Part of the Country. You need
not doubt but I accepted of an Offer so obliging to
my Wishes, assuring myself I should now have an
Opportunity of both seeing and speaking to my ador'd
Idalia, to whom I resolved, let the Consequence be
what it would, to discover who I was; if she was
detained there against her Inclinations, as sometimes
the good Opinion I had of her led me to believe, I 

design'd to bear her off, tho' with the Hazard of my
Life; or if it were thro' Choice she had continu'd
with you, to endeavour, by all the Arguments I was
Master of, to perswade her to remove. ––––But, alas!
my Expectations in this, as in all other Things, were
frustrated; tho' I was in the House several Days, she
kept so close in her Appartment, it was impossible
for me even to get a Glimpse of her: And I was beginning
to despair I ever should be so bless'd, when as
I was sitting in the Hall, meditating to what little
Purpose was all the Pains I had taken, Ardella came
to me, and bidding me follow her into the Garden,
led me to that Part of it which was most remote from
the House, and taking me by the Hand, Banno, (said
she, for that was the Name I went by,) you pretend
a great deal of Friendship to me, what would you do
to prove the Reality of what you have profess'd? 
You may imagine I was not a little surpris'd at
her speaking in this Manner; but soon recollected
myself enough to assure her, I would do any Thing
in my Power. What I have to desire of you, (resumed
she,) will not only be an Obligation to me, but
also to yourself, if you are but possess'd of two Qualities
necessary for the Undertaking; they are Secrecy and
Resolution: Therefore, before you promise, examine your
own Heart, whether there is any Thing in it which
would tremble at the Performance of a Deed, perhaps,
such as the World calls by the Name of bloody,–––– 
cruel,––––barbarous, and such-like Epithets, invented only
to fright the Ignorant from accomplishing their Wishes,
and cheat us into tame Enduring:–––Weigh well, if you
can boldly make your Fortune by one brave Blow, without
a childish Repentance afterwards, which would undo
both yourself, and those by whom you are employ'd. I
was too impatient to know what 'twas she meant
to hesitate much what Answer to make, but immediately
promis'd to stick at nothing, not thinking myself
oblig'd to a Performance, if it were either inconsistent
with my Honour, or Interest. ––––My ready
Compliance made her take me for such a one as she 

wanted; and shewing me a Purse of Gold, Look
here! said she, all this is yours to encourage you in the
Undertaking; but there are three Times as much in
store for you when you bring Word 'tis done:––––But
let me know it, said I, that I may haste to execute
it. ––––I depend upon you, answer'd she, and hope you
will be so much a Friend to yourself, as not to disappoint
the good Opinion I have of you. –––You must know there
is a Lady of the highest Quality in Venice, who has
taken a Disgust to a Woman, and would willingly have
her dispatch'd into another World. She is at present in
this House; but there are Reasons which make it not
proper the Deed should be done here;––––but early in the
Morning,–––I will put you in a Way.–––– 
The Horror which seiz'd my Soul at this monstrous
Injunction, which by all Circumstances I was
certain my Sister was the Contriver of, was too great
for Description; but the Darkness (for it was Night)
help'd me to conceal it from the Observation of this
Wretch; and she bidding me be up by Break of Day,
went into the House, leaving me to ruminate on
what I had promis'd to perform. In the midst of my
Concern for having a Sister oversway'd by her Passions
to an Act so detestable, I rejoic'd that I had it
in my Power to prevent the Perpetration of so black
a Purpose, and spent best Part of the Night in determining
how I should contrive to preserve a Life,
which I doubted not but her Malice would a second
Time attempt, if she shou'd know she had been disappointed
in the first. At last I bethought me of a
Woman, who had formerly been a Nurse in our Family,
and was now removed with her Husband to a
little House a great Distance from any Town; there I
resolved to secure the design'd Victim from any future
Violence; and when I reflected on the Blessing
this Chance would give me, I could scarce lament I
had a Sister of so cruel a Disposition, since to her Barbarity
I should be indebted for a Joy, which 'twas
probable not all my own Assiduity, and constant Services,
would ever have been able to obtain. 

As the unfortunate Honorius was in this Part of his
Relation, the intermitting Torture which had given
him liberty to utter thus much, return'd with treble
Fury: He roar'd with Extremity of Anguish:–––– 
Nimble Twitches ran thro' all his Frame,––––convulsing
every Nerve:––––Sure at that Time he must
be possess'd with more than mortal Courage to sustain
such Racks, else would he by some Act of Desperation
have finish'd them at once.–––– 
As Myrtano was going on in condoling the Misery
this unhappy Gentleman had endur'd, Idalia, not a
little amaz'd to hear that the unknown Person, to
whom she was so much oblig'd, was Honorius, had
the greatest Impatience imaginable to know the End
of this Adventure; and that he might the sooner come
to a Conclusion, desired he would wave all the Particulars
in what Manner she had been preserv'd, and
come to those of which she yet was ignorant. 
Madam, reply'd Myrtano, he was not in a Capacity
of relating much more than what I have recounted; 
there was in this last Fit so little Intermission
of his Agonies, that he had only Space between
them to run over, in as brief a Manner as he could,
his Behaviour to you in the Forest, and his conducting
you to the House he had thought of for you; 
but as he was just going to mention in what Part of
the Country it stood, he was seiz'd with another Pain,
which was to that Violence, that it entirely deprived
him of his Senses, and from that Time all he said was
so unconnect and wild, that nothing was to be inferred
from it. I was infinitely troubled when I found
it was not in his Power to give me any Account how
he came, after he had left you, to my House again,
to receive that fatal Drug from the Hands of Ardella;
but resolving at my Return to force the Knowledge
from her, I left my Servants, who by this Time were
all come back, to attend the Litter, while I posted
home to secure her. She, who was far from imagining
what had reach'd my Ears, came into the
Room immediately on my calling for her; and was 

beginning with a well-acted Disquiet to tell me a long
Story of your making your Escape unknown to her; 
but I was too full of Distraction both for your being
gone, and the dreadful Mischief which by her Means
had fallen on Honorius, to endure to listen to her, and
put a Stop to her Discourse by telling her I was made
acquainted with her horrid Actions; and accusing her
both with the Murder of you, and the very Man
whom she had brib'd to that inhuman Deed, gave her
so terrible a Fright, that she immediately fell on her
Knees, and confess'd herself guilty. After which I
oblig'd her to acquaint me with the Particulars of her
Crime, and she recounted to me how, by the Instigations
of Donna Antonia, she had given you a Letter,
which was to make me appear guilty of the
highest Baseness imaginable, and by the same cruel
Woman's Orders had contriv'd your Death, and then
that of the Person employ'd in it, fearing he might
some time or other betray what he had done: But
when I told her, him whom she had poison'd was
Don Honorius, the Brother of Antonia, and she saw
him brought in, I thought the Creature would have
dy'd with Fear: She again threw herself at my Feet,
and trembling, conjur'd me to permit her to make her
Escape; but I would not grant her Request, resolving,
if Honorius dy'd, to give her up to Justice, and in the
mean time had her confin'd in a Room on the Top of
the House, whence it was impossible for her to get
away, without the Knowledge of the Servant whom
I order'd to keep the Key: But by what Insinuations
I know not, she beguil'd him to betray his Trust, and
they both fled together; but where, I never could
learn, nor indeed did I give myself much Trouble
about it, knowing if the Business should come before a
Magistrate, there would appear so much Intricacy in
the Affair, especially when Antonia interpos'd her Cunning,
as the Case for her own sake exceedingly required
her to do, he would be extremely puzzled what
Sentence to give. But to return to Honorius: When
the Physician had examin'd his Pulse, and watch'd some 

Hours by him, and given proper Medicines to expel
the Poison, he seem'd to be in great Hope of saving
him. Antonia, whom I immediately writ to, with
an Account of what had happen'd, came to Vicenza;
almost as much distracted, or feign'd to be so, for the
Mischief she had caus'd, as her Brother was. But not
to spin out my Narration beyond your Patience, after
a prodigious deal of lingring Torment, he at last was
out of Danger, the Poison not happening to have been
strong enough to seize the Seats of Life, tho' it miserably
destroy'd the Outworks: He lost his Hair, Eyebrows,
and the finest Set of! Teeth that could be:––– 
His Strength was very much decay'd, and all the Vivacity
and Gaiety of his Temper gone: Nothing of
what he was remain'd, but his unextinguishable Passion
for you; and that enabled him to take a Journey
to the Place where he had left you, before he could
get the Physician's Consent to venture a little Walk in
the Garden; but contrary to all our Perswasions he
went, tho' till his Return he made no Confident whither
he was going, imagining, as he told me afterwards,
that had I been appris'd of his Design, my Passion
would have carry'd me there before him. And
indeed he was not deceiv'd in his Conjecture; no Consideration
should have withheld me a Moment, had I
known what Place Idalia's Presence bless'd, and to
that End watch'd every unguarded Word his Frenzy
utter'd, in hope of discovering the dear Secret; but
failing of it then, could not expect it at his Return of
Reason. Never did I see a Man so oppress'd with
Melancholly as he was, when he came back from
seeking you: He then related to me where he had
left you, and your Removal from thence, none knew
to what Place; and lamented with so zealous a Concern
the Improbability there was he ever should be so
happy to see you more, that I, tho' his Rival, and
brought into the same Misfortune by him, could not
deny my Compassion to his Grief. ––––But why should
I delay to tell you, that the Loss of you sat so near
his Heart, that he grew weary of the World, resolv'd 

to appear in it no more, and enter'd into the Society
of Gray Friars, of which there is a Convent at Segonadica. 
I was pretty near bearing him Company,
for Antonia finding all the soft Blandishments she made
use of were ineffectual to work the End she aim'd at,
made an Application to the Doge: The great Interest
her Uncle the Count had with him, engag'd him to
favour her Cause so far, as to leave me no other Choice
than the Performance of my Contract with her, or
go immediately into a Monastery, and by taking Orders
set her at liberty to marry another. I will not
trouble you with the Chagrin I was in at this arbitrary
Decree, which yet I had no Appeal from. –––– 
You see me now her Husband. ––––Soon after I became
so, Count Miramont died, and Honorius having for-sook
the World, the greatest Part of the vast Possessions
he was master of fell to Antonia, on which Occasion
we came to Rome, most of the Estate lying
hereabouts: A Blessing, (added he,) little proportionable
to that which Heaven has so unexpectedly favour'd
me with, the meeting here the dear, the
everlasting Mistress of my Soul, my never, never-to-be-forgotten
Idalia! 
He clos'd this long Discourse with a tender Pressure
of her Hand, and such an Infinity of soft Transport
in his Eyes, as sufficiently assur'd her Marriage had
made no Alteration in his Sentiments. But she, who
expected to hear something more of what the Designs
of Honorius had been, ask'd Myrtano, if he had never
heard any Mention of a Letter she had entrusted him
with to her Father; which after having begg'd her
Pardon for omitting that Part of his Rival's Generosity,
he inform'd her, that he had told him, the Reason
of his desiring her to write to Don Bernardo, was,
that he might have a Pretence to wait on him, and
declaring the Passion he long had for her, ask his Consent
to make him happy; which if obtain'd, he would
have return'd to her without his Disguise, and brought
her back to Venice with an Equipage suitable to the
Quality of Don Bernardo's Daughter and Honorius's 

Wife. 'Tis much, (said Idalia,) that if he were possess'd
of so sincere an Affection as what you represent, he
discover'd not himself before he left me, having done me a
Service which he might well believe would entitle him to
my Esteem. ––––The Reason he gave me for it, (answer'd
Myrtano bowing,) is such a one as is infinitely
glorious to me; but I know not if you will pardon my
repeating it. ––––He said, adorable Idalia! that he found
you too full of Tenderness for the happy Myrtano, to hope
he should be able to find Room in your Heart for any
second Impression, till Time and Absence, and your
Opinion of my Infidelity, had help'd him to eraze the former. 
Idalia could not forbear blushing at these Words,
which put her so much in mind of the Extravagancies
she had utter'd in the Forest, little suspecting she
had such a Witness of them. But she had a Person by
her, who would not see her in that soft Confusion
without taking his Advantage of it, and making use
of all those tender Artifices which Love inspires to
charm the list'ning Fair, he at last won her to confess
that he was still as dear to her as ever: He would not
leave the Chamber till she had promis'd to stay with
him for some Time, as at first she had made a Scruple
of doing, since she imagin'd (as indeed it was natural
enough to believe) Antonia would not only be excessively
disquieted herself, but also contrive all the Means
her Wit and Malice could furnish her with to render
her so too. Nor did her Fears deceive her: Never was
a Family more distracted than that of Myrtano's, the
restless and indignant Temper of his Wife being, by his
keeping a watchful Eye over all her Actions, prevented
from bursting out in publick, shew'd itself in the most
trivial Concerns. She seem'd to make it her whole
Study to disoblige him; and he on the other Side, heartily
hating her, did all he could to break her Heart. 
The Servants were ever countermanded by the one, if
about to do any Thing they were order'd by the other; 
Myrtano always exerting his Authority, would be obey'd,
and Antonia was not of a Humour to endure it. ––––All
their Days were pass'd in Quarrels, and their Nights 

in sullen Discontent. ––––Idalia alone was uncontroll'd,
and free from those Jars with which the Ears of every
other Person in the House were grated. ––––None presum'd
to contradict her Will, and she had nothing to
disturb her Repose, but what she endur'd from the
Reproaches of her own Meditations, for having been
the Cause of so much Unhappiness to others. To
make her Life more easy, the amorous Myrtano had
prevail'd on her to throw off her Disguise of Mens
Cloaths, and in exchange for them had presented her
with various Suits of the richest, and most becoming
a young Lady could wear; and to prevent the Servants,
or any other Person who had seen her in another
Garb, from making any Constructions to her Disadvantage
on her Change of Habit, forc'd the haughty
Soul of Antonia to submit so far to his Humour, as
to own her still for a Relation of her's, who for some
Reasons had for a Time thought fit to disguise her
Sex. ––––What a Stab this must be to a Wife, let any
one judge! ––––But the Crimes she had been guilty of,
in first conspiring against her Life, and afterwards in
entertaining a Passion so contrary to her Matrimonial
Vow, made it but just she should receive such Treatment:
But as she was of a Nature too impatient to
reflect on what she had done amiss, so she had also
too much Pride to endure the Punishment 'without
Agonies, which sometimes brought her into a Condition
little differing from Madness. ––––She complain'd
of her ill Fate, but had none to remedy it:––––She
curs'd, but had none to assist her in her Desire of
Vengeance. ––––Fancy cannot form an Idea of more
consummate Wretchedness than what this Lady suffer'd,
compell'd to obey, yet eager to command,–––– 
wild to proclaim her Wrongs, yet oblig'd to call 'em
none, lest by publishing her Husband's Faults, she should
give him a Pretence for exposing her's. 
IDALIA all this while pass'd her Hours in those
Amusements, in which her Soul most delighted; she
list'ning to the incessant Vows, and soft Insinuations
which daily fell from the enchanting Tongue of her 

ador'd Myrtano, rejoic'd to find him guilty of no other
Infidelity than what his Fate compell'd him to; and
transported that his Affections were rather heighten'd
than diminish'd, and utterly forgetting the solemn Protestation
she had made before she fled from Vicenza,
never, on any Terms, to yield to see him more, or
think of him but with Disdain and Hatred, a Monastery
was now the least of her Desire; and tho' he
had not yet offer'd at any Freedoms more than Innocence
would allow, there was a small Probability that
he would always continue to put so great a Constraint
on his Inclinations;––––yet did she either not consider
it at all, or in so slight a Manner as gave her no
Pain. ––––Those Apprehensions which had so much
alarm'd her, when, to preserve her Honour, she hazarded
all the Dangers of the Sea, were now no more:–––– 
Lull'd in the pleasing Lethargy of Love, Reflection
slept, and all the vigorous Warnings of Virtue, Fame,
and Reputation, were in the soft Enchantment hush'd
to Peace:––––She saw nothing but Myrtano,––––heard
nothing but Myrtano;––––her Soul, all dissolv'd in tender
Languishments, had no Leisure for any other Contemplation:
––––He soon perceiv'd it, and with soothing
Art by unperceiv'd Degrees stole gently from one Liberty
to another, till at last, almost unawares even to
herself, she yielded to all his burning Passion aim'd at,
and thought the guilty Joy sufficient Compensation
for the Loss of Honour. 
MYRTANO had an unfashionable Constancy in
his Nature, which made him not esteem Idalia the less
for her giving him this last and greatest Proof of the
Tenderness she had for him. ––––Possession was so far
from abating, that it rather increas'd the Ardour of his
Affections:–––He never saw her without new Desires; 
each Look express'd unsatiated Longings; and every
Enjoyment was like the first, or more transporting. 
Thus for a Time were both as bless'd as the Gratification
of their utmost Wishes could make them: But
guilty Pleasures are never of any long Continuance; 
the inconsiderate Heart, which, quitting Virtue, places 

its whole Felicity in Love, sooner or later, must confess
the Error, and curse in unavailing Penitence the
luscious Crime which lured them on to Ruin. The
Sense-enslav'd Myrtano, and his unthinking Mistress,
were not permitted to riot many Months in their unlicensed
Raptures, before as dreadful as unforeseen
an Accident happen'd, which was the Occasion of separating
them for ever. 
The enrag'd Antonia perceiving it an Impossibility
ever to regain the Esteem of her Husband by the
Measures she took, and disdaining to make use of any
softer Means, bent her whole Thoughts on Vengeance:
––––The Contentment she saw in the Eyes both
of him and Idalia, put her beyond all Patience;––––she
could not bear it;––––and being, by Myrtano's Watchfulness,
and Knowledge of her vindictive Nature, prevented
from doing any Mischief to either of them,
resolv'd to buy Revenge at any rate, she at last form'd
a Design which she thought could not fail of answering
her End. ––––What is it that Desperation is not
capable of performing? ––––Those who value not their
own Lives, with Ease may reach that of another's,–––– 
and Death to her was but a trivial Ill, in comparison
with what she endur'd in Life;––––she was willing
to plunge into Perdition herself, provided she cou'd
but drag the Persons she hated along with her. To
facilitate her horrid Purpose, she affected to be much
more satisfied in her Mind than of late she had been,
and with an Air of Humiliation said to Myrtano,
That being fully convinc'd that the Misfortune of
estranging his Affections from her, had been wholly
owing to her own ill Management, she was now
struck with so sincere a Contrition for what she had
done, that cou'd she but obtain a Pardon from him
and Idalia, she would forsake the World, and retire
to a Cloyster, and by her future Acts of Piety and
Devotion, endeavour to expiate for the Errors of the
past. He was too well acquainted with her Art of
feigning, to depend much on the Truth of what she
said, but wou'd not seem to question it, lest if she 

had really the Intentions she pretended, (as 'twas not
impossible but she might,) his Suspicion shou'd throw
her into her former Violence of Temper, and occasion
a Change in her Resolution, than the Execution
of which nothing could have given him a greater Satisfaction. 
He communicated what had been told him,
and his Sentiments of it to Idalia, who join'd in his
Opinion, that there was scarce a Hope she shou'd in
good earnest be so alter'd; and also that it was proper
for 'em both, however, to counterfeit a Credulity,
that, by seeming unguarded, they might the better
penetrate into her Designs. But that requir'd more
Skill than either of them were possess'd of: The subtil
Antonia laid her Scheme too deep to be fathom'd
by all their Artifices; she behav'd in such a Manner,
that it was impossible not to believe her an entire
Convert; she pray'd, fasted, wept, nay, really sent to
the Convent of Pour Clairs, entreating they would
accept of her; which being granted, and every Thing
prepar'd for going, she begg'd that her Husband and
Ldalia wou'd pass an Hour or two in her Apartment,
and accept of a little Repast with her, before she took
her everlasting Leave: She said she could not promise
herself an entire Forgiveness of them, without they
obliged her in this Request. Neither of them cou'd
handsomely refuse her, tho' Idalia wou'd have been
better pleased to have been excused; but the Consideration
that it was the last Time she shou'd ever be
shock'd with her Presence, made her the more easily
comply. 
A very noble Collation was provided; and Antonia
still continuing to wear her Countenance of Mildness,
taking up a large Silver Cup, which she had order'd
to be fill'd with Wine. ––––Here, Madam, said she,
may all Offences between us be for ever buried in Oblivion; 
––––and you, (pursu'd she, turning to Myrtano,)
my once lov'd Husband, and I hope my everlasting
Friend, tho' in this World, Heaven and my own Misfortunes
separate me from you, may we in another
taste all those Joys which are denied me here:––––Pledge 

me, both of you, or I shall think you have but half
forgiven those Faults which Passion, Youth, and Inadvertency
have made me guilty of. Myrtano could not
hear these Words, which were accompany'd with a
Shower of well-dissembled Tears, without dissolving
too; and now fully believing she was in earnest, cou'd
not help pitying her Condition. ––––He took the Cup
out of her Hand with a deep Sigh; but being about to
drink, a Servant, who stood at the Door, observing
all that past, ran hastily to him, and snatching from
his Lips the fatal Draught, cry'd, What is it you
wou'd do, Signior? This Wine is mingled with some pernicious
Drug. What means the Fellow! (interrupted
he,) dost thou not see Antonia has drank of it? But do
not you, (resum'd the other;) I saw her when she believ'd
no Eye but Heaven's was Witness of the Deed,
take from her Pocket a little Viol full of something, which,
I believe, was Poison, and pour it in that Cup, then
call'd for Wine, and mingled them together. 'Tis false,
(cry'd Antonia,) 'tis false! and thou, Myrtano, hast
suborn'd this Villain to accuse me, on purpose to make
me hateful to the World, and rob me of that Compassion
which my Sufferings merit. ––––Hold, Madam, (said
Myrtano, strangely amaz'd,) moderate your Passion; if
wrong'd, you shall have Justice. Tell me, (continu'd
he sternly, to the Fellow,) by what Means came you
to see this Action of your Lady, which you say she did
with so much Privacy. I was coming into the Room,
(reply'd he, with an assur'd Accent,) ignorant that
any body was in it, to fetch something I had forgot and
left there when I had lighted up Candles: But as I
was opening the Door, I saw my Lady, without being
seen by her, for her Back was towards me; but standing
opposite to a great Glass and Candle by her, I had
the Opportunity of discovering what she was about;–––– 
I plainly saw her mix the Liquors, which I should not
have suspected to be Poison, had I not also heard her
speak to herself these Words,––––Revenge is more than
Life; and presently after, I cannot feel the Pains of
Hell, while I see them in 'em; (said she,) Damnation 

will be Pleasure, if they share it with me. This,
Signior, (continu'd he, bowing,) was sufficient to make
me fear she had something more in Agitation than she
pretended, and oblig'd me to watch to whom that Cup
was offer'd. Oh! 'tis all a monstrous Lye, (interrupted
she;) you see he contradicts himself: He says 'tis Poison,
and that he watch'd to whom I offer'd it:–––Did I not
myself first drink, and would I destroy myself? ––––I
know not (said Myrtano) to what Extremes you may have
had recourse; but if you have here mix'd any Ingredients
unfit for me to take,––––thus I disappoint your Aim. 
With these Words he took the Cup out of the Fellow's
Hand, and dash'd all that was in it on the Floor. 
This Action made Antonia throw off the Mask of
meek Humility, and appear the Fury: But I will not
be disappointed, cried she, snatching a Sword which
by Accident lay on the Window, and running at Idalia,
nor Heaven nor Earth shall ward my Vengeance
here. But she soon found herself mistaken; Myrtano
was quick enough to wrest the Weapon from her,
with these Words, Vile Woman, said he, now you appear
yourself; but as the shameful Passion you had for
this Lady, while you believed her in a Capacity of returning
it, preserved her once from my mistaken Rage; 
so shall my Care both now and ever shield her from
your Malice. And must I then die alone (cried she
in a distracted Tone,) must all I have done serve but
to leave you free for the Embraces of a Rival? –––– 
And must she, that hated Cause of all my Misery, be
blest when I am no more? ––––O Torment, worse than
Hell! –––Snatch,–––snatch me, Fiends, there's not a Spirit
damn'd among you feels half my Pains! ––––Yes, I
confess I would have poisoned both; and 'twas the
only Joy Thought could allow my lost forlorn Condition,
that I should see you, cursing each other in the Pangs
of Death for those hot Wishes which brought on your
Ruin;––––then sink together to the lowest Hell, where I
should follow, and be your Tormentor still. ––––Oh! (continued
she, endeavouring to fly at Idalia,) that vile
Enchantress, whose bewitching Smiles first taught my Soul 

to know an unchaste Desire, had she but perished with
me, I would have absolved my Fate of all Injustice. 
In this manner did she rave, till Don Myrtano,
thinking what was most proper to be done, after
having took the trembling Idalia out of the Room,
sent for Physicians to endeavour, if possible, to expel
the envenom'd Draught before it had operated too
far. But they soon found she had not drank a sufficient
Quantity to endanger Life, tho' it happen'd not
thro' Care, having no other Design than to die with
those her Revenge was so zealous to send out of the
World; knowing the very Manner of their Deaths
cou'd not be kept a Secret, and that the Law wou'd
not suffer such Murders to go unpunish'd. In spite
of the Impatience of her Temper, which, longer
than else it wou'd have been, protracted her Recovery,
she was perfectly well in a few Days. But this Adventure
being whisper'd about from one to the other,
(as in such a Family it could not be otherwise,)
made so great a Noise in Rome, that it came at last
to the Ears of his Holiness: He had a particular Regard
for Myrtano, on the Account of his good Qualities; 
and for Antonia, as she was Niece to Count
Miramont, for whom he had had a very great Friendship; 
and being concern'd to hear of so unhappy a Disturbance
between them, sent for them to know the
Truth of the Affair. Myrtano wou'd have gloss'd it
over in as plausible a Manner as he cou'd; but his
enrag'd Wife, whose Fury was not in the least abated,
rejoic'd in this Opportunity of exposing him
and Idalia; which she did in the most bitter and invective
Terms her Malice cou'd invent: And this
Proceeding oblig'd him, in return, to lay open all
her Actions, her Intention to murder that Lady while
at Vicenza, the base Contrivance of the Letter which
drove her from that Place, the Poison which Ardella,
by her Orders, gave the unknown Person, who proved
to be her Brother Don Honorius dell Miramont; her
Passion for Idalia while she believ'd her to be a Man; 
and lastly, her Design of poisoning both him and her. 

So monstrous a Catalogue of Vices turn'd the Holy
Examiner entirely against her; he cou'd no longer endeavour
to perswade them to a Reconciliation, and
told Antonia she was a Woman of too dangerous a
Disposition to be left at her own Liberty, and therefore
order'd she should be forthwith confin'd for Life
in that very Convent of Pour Clairs, which she had
pretended to go to out of Devotion. As for Myrtano,
he chid him a little for giving Cause of Provocation,
and told him he must resolve to part with
Idalia, it being consistent with neither of their Reputations
to live together; and that it was not only
the Ruin of their own Souls to continue in that
Course of Life, but also of Antonia's, who would
never be a thorough Convert till she was eased of the
Torments of Jealousy. He closed the pious Exhortations
he had made as Priest, with a positive
Command as Pope and supreme Dictator, that Idalia
should quit his House immediately, and from that
Moment he should refrain her Company. This last
Sentence afforded some Contentment to the restless
Hate of Antonia, and she obey'd her own with less
Reluctance, as sensible they wou'd not be less miserable
in being separated from each other, than she was
in the Disappointment of the Revenge she purposed. 
But what Tongue is able to express the Despair
the poor Idalia fell into, when Myrtano brought her
home these doleful Tidings? At first he had Power
only to inform her with his Eyes that he had something
fatal to unfold; but the dreadful Secret must be
told, and bursting Sighs, half Words, and broken Sentences,
at last made her know the worst:––––She wept,
swoon'd, almost dy'd away, while he was speaking:
Nor were his Agonies inferior to those which she
endured. But there was no resisting a Power, such as
that which had decreed their Misfortune, at least while
they continued at Rome:––––All that remained to prop
up falling Hope, was a Promise he made her of removing
as soon as he could dispose of what Effects he had
there, either out of the Pope's Dominions, or to some 

remote Part of them, whence no Intelligence of
their Behaviour might reach his Knowledge. This
comforted her a little, and she went to a House where
he had provided her a Lodging, and Servants to attend
her. It happen'd to be in a very pleasant Part
of the City, next Door to a Monastery of Benedictines,
among whom being a great Number of Ladies of the
best Families in Rome, he hoped, by being acquainted
with them, and visiting there sometimes, she might
find some Alleviation to her Sorrows. It was some
Time before she could bring herself even to wish to
receive any Consolation; but being by his daily Importunities
(for he constantly writ to her) prevailed
on to divert herself by all the Means that were in
her Power, she one Day took a little Walk in the
Cloyster-Gardens: While she was there, the Bell rung,
and having a little Curiosity to see the Nuns at Prayers,
went into the Chapel, where almost the first she
cast her Eyes on was a Face perfectly known to her,
tho' she could not presently recollect where she had
seen it; but going a little nearer, she soon knew the
Lady to be the beautiful Bellraizia, who, she thought,
had perished in the Storm from which herself had so
narrowly escaped. The high Esteem she had conceived
for her, made her extremely glad, to see her
safe, but the finding her in that Society, so contrary
to the Religion she had been educated in, and her Engagements
with Abdomar, gave her an adequate Concern,
not doubting but that unhappy Gentleman was
lost. She longed impatiently for the End of the Ceremony,
that she might be informed what had occasioned
so strange an Alteration; and singling herself
from the Crowd, and standing in a Corner of the
Chapel, as near as she could to that Place where the
Nuns go out, she gave her a little pluck by the Sleeve
as she passed by; which the fair Nun perceiving,
made a Stop, and looking on Idalia, immediately
knew her. There passed several Congratulations between
them for their mutual Deliverance from so
imminent a Danger; but the Place they were in not 

allowing any long Conversation, Idalia could be made
acquainted with no more at that Time than that Abdomar
had also been preserved; and the being told
this, was no small Addition to the Surprise she had
been in before; which the beautiful Convert easily
discerning, told her with a Smile the Wonder should
be satisfied, if she would favour her with a Visit the
next Day; which Idalia assuring that she would, took
her Leave. 
At the Time appointed she enquired for her at
the Grate, where a Couple of young Devotees where
standing, and was answered by one of them, That as
for Bellraizia, they knew nothing of her by that
Name, but that a Lady of a foreign Nation had lately
enter'd herself among them, which 'twas probable
was the same she enquired for, for she had been but
lately christen'd, and was called Theresa. Idalia imagining
it might be she, desired to see her, and the
others very obligingly ran to fetch her, who was indeed
the same. After a little Discourse on ordinary
Affairs, Idalia expressing her Impatience to know
what had been the Occasion of this sudden Turn in
her Principles, as well as Affairs, entreated she would
give a Solution to what at present appear'd so great a
Riddle: I must be more rude and unpolite than the
most Ignorant of the Country I came from, (answered
the lovely Proselyte,) if I should refuse to satisfy a Demand
which so obligingly testifies you take some little
Interest in my Concerns, and have not forgot the Friendship
we promised to each other, at a Time when neither
of us expected to meet in any other Place than that
which we then were in. But because to relate only what
has befallen me since I had the Happiness of seeing you,
would render the History of my Life imperfect, if you
please I will run over, with as much Brevity as the several
Incidents will permit, the Remainder of those Misfortunes,
which the Tempest oblig'd me to break off. 
Idalia thanking her with a low Bow for the Trouble she
was about to give herself, sat down to listen to what she
said, which was in this Manner! 

The Continuance of the History of Abdomar
and Bellraizia.
I Was confined (said she) in the Manner I told you
for several Days before I saw any Person from
whom I could learn any News how Abdomar had
been disposed of; which gave me a Rack of Thought
infinitely superior to what I felt on my own Account. 
The first that visited me was Zatilda, enjoined by
her Father, and mine, and Mulyzeden, (as she did not
fail of letting me know,) to dive into my Sentiments,
and find out if possible the Truth of the whole Affair
between me and Abdomar: Because the Posture he
had been found in by the Prince, made them all positive
that I had been made acquainted with his Passion. 
And nothing, she told me, could convince them
that I had not only listen'd to, but also allow'd of his
Courtship, if I did not instantly consent to ratify the
Contract with Mulyzeden. You may believe 'twas
with an inexpressible Trouble she brought me these
Tidings, not doubting but that I should be obliged
to comply, to the eternal Ruin of her Hopes: But I
assured her to the contrary by all the Asseverations I could
make, protesting I would rather die than make her
so unhappy, if no other Obstacle but my Friendship
to her had interpos'd; but as I loved the Charming
Abdomar, and was beloved by him with an equal
Height of Passion, though his Generosity obliged him
to conceal it from me, no Threats, no Tortures, should
force me to act so contrary both to my own Wishes
and theirs, who of all the World were dearest to me. 
My renewing the Vows I had before made her on
this Score, dissipated great Part of the Chargin she
brought with her; but, alas! she had it not in her
Power to give any Relief to mine, having been able
to learn nothing concerning Abdomar, but that he
was in close Prison, and that Mulyzeden was yet irresolute
what Sentence to pass on him. All the dreadful 

Examples of which I had heard or read of jealous
Love, came into my Head the Moment she told me
this: I fancied I saw him bleeding, dying, for my
sake, and begged Zatilda for her own sake (since
nothing else could give her the Happiness she wished)
and for the sake of us all to permit me to reveal the
Secret of her Passion for Mulyzeden: That (said I)
once known, will oblige the King not to take it ill that
I refused to do, what done, would make his Daughter
wretched. ––––My Father will not dare to force my Inclinations
against the Interest of his Princess, and Mulyzeden
cannot but glory in the Exchange. ––––All of us
may be happy in our several Wishes, would you consent. –––– 
But all I could urge was in vain to win this modest
Princess to give me the Liberty I ask'd; she swore
rather to die than proffer Love; and we parted without
being able to resolve on any Thing for our common
Satisfaction. 
It must be only the Imagination of a Person involved
in the same Perplexities I was, can figure an
Idea of what I endured in the Reflection of my unhappy
State; but as I was sitting alone, after Zatilda
had left me, the Windows being open for Coolness,
I saw something fly in at one of them, and fall at
my Feet: Stooping to take it up, I perceived it was
a Paper; which hastily opening, I found it contain'd
these Lines, which I too often repeated to forget, and
were in this Manner. 

To the Divine Bellraizia.
I believe it needless to inform you, that the Posture I
was found in by my Prince, has occasion'd a Jealousy
of me: But I confess I have not Generosity enough
to suffer so great a Misfortune as the Loss of his Friendship
without wishing to be pity'd by her, for whom I am
content to endure greater Ills. Mulyzeden accuses me,
most excellent Princess, of adoring you; and, oh! I acknowledge
the involuntary Crime! But as my Lips have 

ne'er offended by any presumptious Declarations, I hope,
though he cannot, Goodness like your's will pardon a
Transgression, which I doubt not but I have as many
Sharers in, as there are Souls to be sensible of your Perfections. 
I am but this Moment released from my Confinement,
and in a few Hours must leave Barbary for
ever. All I entreat for myself, is your Forgiveness; and
that you will believe the Crime for which I am banished,
I never should have had the Boldness to reveal, had I not
been assured you would have known it without me. 
my next Request, is, that you will do that Justice
to my Prince, which his unbounded Passion, and a Million
of excellent Qualifications, make him merit: And
my last to the Gods, that the choicest Blessings in their
Power to give, may ever be the Portion of you both,
whatever is decreed for 
The Unhappy Abdomar. 

In what Manner shall I make you sensible of the
tender Languishments which at the reading this took
up my Soul? ––––But 'twas not long that soft Confusion
lasted; the Reflection that he was going, that I
should never see him more, embittered all the Sweets
which the Contemplation of so generous a Passion
had afforded. ––––But why should I detain you with
the particular Emotions which agitated me according
as the different Thoughts rose in me:––––In fine, I
lov'd, and could not bear to lose him. ––––All the Remonstrances
of Honour, Grandeur, Reputation, were
silenced by the more powerful Calls of Love: Since
he was banished, I resolved to be the Partner of his
Exile, whatever should ensue. ––––You'll say, considering
the Circumstance I then was in, this was a
Resolution which promis'd little Facility in the Execution; 
yet difficult as it was, the Passion which prompted
it, inspired me also with a Contrivance to perform
it: I bribed one of my Women to procure me
a Suit of Clothes, such as our Negro Slaves are wont
to wear; and oiling my Face, and afterwards rubbing
it over with some Powder, made of the Shells of 

Chesnuts, and tying up my Hair close to my Head,
and covering it with a little Taffety Cap, made myself
appear so like one of those I designed to pass for, that
I had not the least Fear of being suspected. I also prevailed
on the same Woman, whom I had made my
Confident, to put on my Clothes; and if any Person
from the King, Prince Mulyzeden, or my Father, should
happen to be sent soon after I was gone, to lie down
on the Bed, feigning an Indisposition, that they might
not discover it was any other than myself that spoke; 
and exacted a solemn Vow from her, that whatever
happened, she should not confess she knew any thing
of my Escape to any other Person but Zatilda. Every
thing answered my Wish; Abdomar having Leave
till the next Morning to prepare for his Journey, I
mingled with his Train, and found Means to be entertained
among them. I now thought myself most
happy, so easily can Love answer for the want of all
Things else; not that I was so abandoned to Modesty as
to discover myself to him I had run such Risques to
follow; no, I proposed no other Satisfaction in this
Flight than to avoid Mulyzeden, and enjoy the Presence
of the Man I loved; and, indeed, it was a Felicity
unconceivable that I took in thus, unknown by
him, observing all his Motions, in which I found nothing
but what served more to encrease my Admiration
and Esteem. 
But, alas! this Scene of innocent Delight met
with a sudden Interruption: We had not travelled
above fifty Miles from the Court of Barbary, before
we were overtaken, and seiz'd by a Party of the
King's Horse sent after in pursuit of us. Abdomar
demanding the Reason, was answered by the Captain,
That he must bring back the Princess Bellraizia, or
discover where she was, since she had made her Escape,
and 'twas believed by his Instigations. ––––Abdomar
express'd the highest Concern, as well as Astonishment,
at hearing this; but protested, as very
well he might, that he was entirely innocent of it. 
But this could not serve his Turn; the Captain was 

obliged to obey Orders, and we were all brought
back; and Abdomar was immediately conducted into
the Council-Chamber, where all that had Interest in
it were assembled to examine him concerning me. –––– 
The Horrors I endured while this lasted, were such
as it would be impossible to describe: I imagined
that his Innocence would stand him in but little stead
to defend him against a Party, who were resolved to
think him guilty; nor was I mistaken, they disbelieving
all he said, and imagining that if I were not
really in his Company, it was on his Account I had
left Barbary, and that there was some Place agreed
on for our Meetting, ordered he should be rack'd to
make him confess. This Doom being pass'd, he was
brought out; and the Sight of those Men by him,
whom I knew to be the common Executioners of
those kind of Torments, made me know to what
he was decreed; and wild with the Horror of his
suffering them on any Account, much more on mine,
I lost all Sense either of Shame or Danger to myself,
and running in amongst the Guards, cried out to
them, And is it for the Princess Bellraizia that the noble
Abdomar must endure the Rack? ––––If so, let him
be remanded back; I can produce the Princess, and
clear his Innocence. Every Body that stood near
enough to hear me, were strangely alarm'd at what I
said; and some of them, running to the Council-Chamber,
inform'd the King of what I said; on which
the Torments decreed for Abdomar were suspended,
and myself and he introduc'd. 
You may believe how great a Damp 'twas to
me, when I saw the King, my Father, Mulyzeden,
and all the Prime of the Nobility, before whom I
must either discover what I had done, and the Reasons
which occasioned it, or suffer the whole Weight
of their Indignation to fall on him who was infinitely
dearer to me than either Life or Honour. 
Therefore being demanded what I had to offer in
the Defence of Abdomar, and what I knew of Bellraizai,
I boldly answered what they asked with 

another Question, which was, That if I proved the
Princess's Flight unknown to Abdomar, whether
they had any other Crimes to accuse him of? And
all of them assuring me, that if I did so he was entirely
at his Liberty, nothing farther having been alledged
against him, I pull'd off my Cap, and letting
my Hair fall about my Shoulders, See here then, (said
I, with a Courage which I have been since surpris'd
at myself,) see here that Bellraizia whom you seek,
and whom nothing but the Guilt of permitting an innocent
Person to suffer for a Crime she alone is guilty of,
should have obliged to have discovered herself either
to you, or any other. The Amazement the whole Assembly
was in, gave me leave to make a farther Explanation
of my Meaning, and I recounted to them
the Aversion I had for Mulyzeden, my Passion for
Abdomar even before I had the least Hope he would
return it, and, in fine, the whole Truth of my Proceedings,
bating what concern'd Zatilda: And indeed
it had happened much better, if I had also discovered
that; but she had bound me in so strict a Promise,
that I durst not break through it without her Consent. 
To give you a Description of the different Agitations
which I saw in the Countenances of the three
I had most Reason to observe, the King, my Father,
and the Prince, would be too tedious, so I shall only
say, the Fury which I saw in one, could be equall'd
only by the others: All were alike incens'd, tho' for
contrary Reasons. 
I could not be a Judge in what Manner Abdomar
heard so unexpected a Discovery, both because
he stood a little behind me, and also that Shame would
have prevented me from looking on him with that Earnestness
which I did on the others: But if one may
form a Judgment by the Passion he has since prov'd
he was inspired with, his Emotions must at that Time
be more than ordinary. But to return to my Relation; 
My Father was the first that broke Silence, and looking
on me with an Eye that sparkled with Indignation,
It is not (said he) this shameful accusing of yourself, 

that ought to skreen that Traytor from the Hands
of Justice? ––––Yes, (interrupted Mulyzeden, no less
fiercely,) 'tis plain he is guilty; for tho' the Princess
has so ingloriously condescended to yield to his Desires,
I never can believe she would be brought to it without
Professions, such as she thought merited her Compassion. 
'Tis false, (resum'd I, enraged that all I could do was
like to be ineffectual,) and thou, unbelieving Prince,
deservest not to be bless'd with such a Friend as Abdomar. 
Then I pluck'd out of my Pocket a Letter
he had thrown in at my Window, which was a sufficient
Testimony that he never had so much as declared
his Passion for me, much less had importuned
me to go with him, to back what I said. The Princess
Zatilda, who hearing what had pass'd the first
Time that Abdomar had been examin'd in the Council,
and well knowing he had no Share in my Flight,
stepp'd into the Room to clear him of this Charge,
and immediately knowing me, vouch'd the Truth of
what I had alledged. All these Witnesses inclin'd the
King, who was a perfect Lover of Justice, however
prejudicial it might be to his Interest, to recall the
Sentence he had pass'd on Abdomar; at which Mulyzeden,
whose Rage was nothing abated by the Knowledge
that what I had done, had proceeded only from
my own inconsiderate Passion, and thinking himself affronted
on all Sides, turning to the King, Your Majesty,
said he, may, whenever you please, revoke your
own Decrees, but neither Heaven nor Earth shall debar
me from the Prosecution of mine:–––I have vow'd
the Traytor's Death, and thus I make it good. In
speaking these Words, he ran at Abdomar with all the
Fierceness of an inveterate Malice; but that injur'd Gentleman
did not now, as he had done before, bow to
receive the Wound he offer'd, but snatching a Sword
from a Lord that stood near him, put himself in an
Posture of Defence as soon as he perceived the Prince's
Design: Time was, (said he,) I wou'd have welcom'd
Death, but now have Cause to value Life, and must,
and will defend it for the divine Bellraizia, tho' against 

you, next to her, dearest to my Soul. ––––Villain, thou
liest, (resum'd the Prince,) nor shall thy Flattery move
me to Forgiveness. The Guards, which waited at the
Door, were call'd in immediately, and having parted
them, by the King's Command, bore Abdomar to the
same Prison he had been in before; not that he was
to be treated any longer as a Criminal, but his Majesty
thought it most convenient for his Safety, to
secure him there from the Fury of Mulyzeden. He
made me a low Reverence, with such an inexpressible
Tenderness in his Eyes, so soft an Extasy for what
I had declared, as was beyond what any Words could
have acknowledg'd; but I, tho' I observ'd it with as
much Rapture as my Circumstances would allow, was
in too much Confusion to make any Return to the
endearing Charm: But when he was gone, and I was
left alone to the Upbraidings of the whole Assembly,
(for there was not one there who did not blame my
Conduct,) what did I not endure! None but Zatilda
took my Part, and endeavour'd to excuse my Proceedings,
by pleading the Force of that unconquerable
Passion which had been the Cause of them; but
she was immediately silenced by her Father, asking
her how she came to be so well acquainted with Emotions
so contrary to Reason, and to Honour: But
Prince Mulyzeden, who still loved me, entreated them
to cease any further Reproaches, and told me, That if
I would permit him to espouse my Cause, by giving
him that Happiness my Vows had long since made his
Due, all I had done for Abdomar should be forgot. 
No, Sir, (said I,) I have not gone so far in the Race
of Passion to go back:––––I own your Generosity, but 'tis
Abdomar alone I can love. ––––As I was proceeding, my
Father interrupted me, crying out, Degenerate Girl!
unworthy the Regard of this noble Prince! –––But in the
Punishment I will inflict on thee, he shall perceive how
I resent the Indignity thou hast offer'd him. ––––Here,
(continu'd he, to some of the Guards,) bear her to
her Appartment, and let her be shifted of these dishonourable
Rags;––––these shameful Witnesses of her Folly. 

The Princess Zatilda had leave to accompany me, but
had it not in her Power to give me much Consolation,
or to receive it herself; and I believe never two
had more Distraction in their Thoughts than we. –––– 
I again endeavour'd, by all the Arguments I was
Mistress of, to perswade her to permit me to reveal
the kind Thoughts she had of Mulyzeden; but she was
still obstinate, and would listen to nothing I could say
on that Score, and conjured me afresh never to let the
Secret slip. But Providence brought it to light without
my Breach of Promise; and we might all have
been happy, if Modesty, which in others is the greatest
Virtue, had not, by its Excess, been her Enemy, and
disappointed the Aim of Heaven: One of my Women,
who, it seems, had been appointed to attend me
only as a Spy, listen'd to the Conversation we had together,
and related it to both our Fathers; which you
may guess was no small Surprise to them: But mine
was so much vex'd at it, as believing this would certainly
take away all Hope of my ever being Princess
of Fez, that crossing his Ambition, he fell into a
Fever, of which he dy'd. The King set me at liberty
immediately after his Death, but would not disoblige
the Prince so much as to give me leave to marry
Abdomar, who was still in Confinement. ––––Zatilda
was yet ignorant that her Secret had been discover'd; 
and the King perceiving that Mulyzeden still had the same
Passion for me as ever, knew not which way to bring
it about; but at last, finding his Daughter grow extremely
ill, (as that poor Princess had ever since been
consuming with inward Agonies,) he proposed the
Matter to him. Never Man had a greater Share of
Generosity than that unhappy Prince; and he could
not hear he was beloved by a Princess, whom it was
not his Destiny to love, without an Infinity of Concern,
but had nothing of those Sentiments, which were
requisite to make her happy. However, the tender Concern
which fill'd his Soul, might possibly have ripen'd
into something more to her Advantage, had she not
put herself past the Power of receiving it: The Discourse 

the King had with him on this Score, was in
the Palace-Garden, in that very Grotto where I had
made the Discovery of the Passion which Abdomar
had for me: The ill-fated Zatilda happen'd to be in
one Part of it, while they were in the other, and overheard
all that pass'd; and overcome with Shame that
the Secret was discover'd, and guessing by the Answers
which Mulyzeden made, that she was like to receive
no other Benefit by it than the Compassion of
the Man she loved, resolved to put an End to the Miseries
she had endured, and full of Desparation, plung'd
that Moment a Dagger into her Breast. The Noise
which her Fall made among the Trees and twisted
Branches, of which the Grotto was composed, obliged
her Father, and the Person for whose sake she had
done this, to rise from their Seats, and look what
'twas occasion'd it. ––––It would be needless to repeat
the Lamentations of a most tenderly loving Father, to
find his only Child welt'ring in her Blood, and breathing
her last; or those which Mulyzeden made, when he
reflected he had been the Cause, tho' an innocent one:
You may easily imagine they were suitable to the
Occasion, and to the Characters of the Persons concern'd
in it. The most eminent Surgeons were sent
for; but the fatal Weapon had reach'd too far, and she
lived no longer than to receive some Words of Compassion
from him, who tho' he could not love, protested
after he would gladly have exchanged Conditions,
and bought the Preservation of her Life at the
Expence of his own. 
When she was gone, there was nothing in the
Coast of Barbary which could induce me to stay in
it: And having obtain'd Leave, I retired into the Country,
to a Castle which had been my Father's. Mulyzeden
would not offer to oppose it, nor had made any
Visits to me since the Death of Zatilda, because he
would give no Umbrage to the King; and I hop'd
my absenting myself, fully convincing him that I never
would be his, would oblige him to return to Fez,
or at least to set Abdomar at liberty, who, I was confident 

as soon as he was so, would find some Means
to let me know it. But, alas! that too constant Prince
could not forget his Passion! all my Unkindness had
not the Power of effacing my Idea in his Soul! he
continu'd to love me with an Ardency which was unvanquishable
but by Death, which at last he yielded
to! And sure if any one ever had a broken Heart, he
had, for he died of no other Disease but Grief. I
have often wonder'd, that, considering the Sweetness
of his Disposition, he had all this while kept Abdomar
in Custody; but Jealousy and disappointed Love can
know no Medium in their Rage. The Moment he
was dead, the King gave Orders that he should be discharg'd,
but desir'd he never would be seen in Barbary. 
I had an immediate Account of all Things, and
met him in the Way. After a thousand mutual Demonstrations
of the tenderest Affection, we exchang'd
Vows never to be parted more; and neither Barbary
nor Fez promising much Security, he bethought him
of buying a Ship, and living a Rover on the Sea, that
being a Province where no mortal Prince had Power
to drive us from. We had been eight Months without
ever setting our Feet on Land, when that dreadful
Storm, in which we thought you lost, shewing us
that Heaven deny'd its Approbation of our Love. 
However, it prevail'd not to separate us: Clasp'd in
each other's Arms, we resolv'd, since there was no
Hope of living, to die together. But when we thought
ourselves most in danger, we were most secure; that
Part of the Ship in which we were, was that which
was dash'd against the Rock, and the other being rent
forcibly away, this seem'd fasten'd to it, and the Storm
immediately ceasing, we remain'd in our tatter'd Castle,
till some Boats coming to our Relief, carry'd us safe
on Shore. 
In the House we were directed to, there was a
Friar, certainly the most holy of his Order: Being inform'd
of Part of our Story by Abdomar and myself,
he told me very freely, that the Breach of my Vows
to Mulyzeden had drawn the Vengeance of Heaven on 

me; and then began to argue with so divine a Zeal
on the mistaken Precepts of our Religion, that in a
few Days he won us both to embrace the Christian
Faith, which my Ancestors had so shamefully abjur'd. 
To expiate the Sin of living so long in a State of Infidelity,
he told us it was necessary to do something
more than a bare Acknowledgment we had been in an
Error; and in fine, in spite of the unbated Passion we
still had for each other, he wrought on us both so far as
to prevail on us to take Orders: And by mortifying
our Desires in the tenderest Part, endeavour to appease
the Offences we had been guilty of. Abdomar, as
well as myself, submitted to it, and he is now with
this good Friar among the Capuchins, and I am settled
here, where so unexpectly I have had the good Fortune
to meet a Person in whose Conversation I promise
myself much Comfort. 
The charming Convert here finish'd her Narration; 
and Idalia reflecting on the Instability of that
Felicity which only Love bestows, began to grow
exceeding melancholy; which the other observing, entreated
to know the Cause, and also what had befallen
her since their Separation; which she complying
with, let the new-made Christian know, that there
were both Misfortunes and Inadvertencies occasion'd
by Passion, as great as what she had experienc'd. 
The visiting this Lady was all the Consolation
Idalia had in her Separation from Myrtano; but she
being soon after taken ill of so malignant a Fever,
that it was thought dangerous to approach her, she
not only lost the Company of one whose Wit and
good Humour often diverted her from any despairing
Thoughts, to which of late she was too liable, but
also of one whose Strictness to the Principles she had
embrac'd, might in Time have won her to a Belief,
that true Happiness was only to be found in Virtue. 
And indeed in the Circumstance she then was, never
Woman stood more in need of an Adviser: The living
in the Manner she had done with Myrtano, his Wife's
Desperation, and the Pope's Decree, had made too 

great a Noise in Rome not to make her be publickly
remark'd; and embolden'd by the Knowledge that she
had been a Mistress, brought all the young and gay
Part of the Town to sollicite for the same Favour; 
nay, some of them used so little Ceremony as to make
her acquainted with their Designs on the first Visit,
and others, treating her as a Courtezan, demanded to
know her Price. Some would agree with her for a
Month, others for a Week; all the Insults that Women
of that Profession are liable to, she met with; which,
considering the Haughtiness of her Disposition, could
not be expected but to drive her to Extreams. She
writ daily to Myrtano, conjuring him to make what
Expedition he could to leave Rome; and he continu'd
to assure her, he was as impatient as herself. But
Things not being ready so soon as she expected, she
grew transported and wild with the daily Affronts she
receiv'd, and was ready to lay violent Hands on her
own Life, rather than endure them longer: She began
to curse the Cause which had reduc'd her to a Condition,
such as could give room for Liberties so contrary
to what she had been us'd to receive, and could
so ill bear:––––She wanted Revenge on all who durst
to use her in this Manner;––––and not having it in
her Power, was ready to burst with inward Spleen,
and stifled Indignation. In this enrag'd Temper, happening
to look out of her Window, she saw a young
Chevalier pass by, whom imagining she had seen before,
she look'd more earnestly at, and soon discover'd
it to be Florez, the Villain who had first betray'd
her from her Father's House, and been the Cause of
all her Woe. A sudden Thought came into her Head
at Sight of him: To be reveng'd on him for all, she
sent a Servant after immediately, to watch where he
went; which being inform'd of, she sat down, and
disguising her Hand as much as possible, writ to him
in this Manner: 


To Don Florez.
A Chevalier, so accomplish'd as you, cannot be surpris'd
to be told the Impression you have made on
a Heart who pretends to a Capacity of distinguishing. –––– 
But I will not go about to tell you how much I am influenc'd
by your Perfections, till I see how you approve
the Conquest you have made over me: If you have an
Hour to spare, bestow it this Evening in the long Walk
behind the Benedictine Nunnery, and just about the
Close of Day you shall meet 
Your enamour'd
Incognita. 

She did not doubt but the Vanity of his Disposition
would make him swallow the Bait she had prepar'd
for him, and sent it by a Servant, charging him
not to discover either her Name, or where she lived,
if Florez should enquire, as 'twas probable he would. 
But the Fellow, who was hired by Myrtano to attend
her, and knew very well it was to him she was indebted
for a Support, thought it a monstrous Infidelity
to his Lord; and instead of delivering it to Florez,
carry'd it directly to him. The Astonishment with
which he read it, is not to be express'd; but resolving
to inform himself to what Lengths the Perfidy he imagined
her guilty of would carry her, he muffled himself
up in his Cloak, and went himself at the appointed
Time to the Place of Assignation, where he had not
waited long before he perceiv'd her coming. There
was so little Difference in their Stature, that she might
be easily deceiv'd; and coming near him, I believe,
Signior, (said she,) you are the Person I would speak
with: Are you not call'd Don Florez? I am, (reply'd
Myrtano, in a low and feign'd Voice.) You had a
Letter, (resum'd she, drawing a Dagger, and striking 

it with all her Force into his Breast, before he had Opportunity
to discover who he was,) and now I give a
Present such as your Villany deserves. She had Opportunity
to say no more, he falling, immediately
cry'd out, O Idalia! what have you done! ––––These
Words, the Voice, and a closer Observation, made her
know to whom she had given the Blow; but all that
can be conceiv'd of distracting Grief, of Horror without
a Name, was short of what she felt at this amasing
Sight: She tore her Hair and Face, rav'd, stamp'd,
curs'd Fate, and scarce spar'd Heaven in the Extremity
of her Anguish: She threw herself upon his bleeding
Body, and kiss'd a thousand Times the Wound she had
made. ––––But this affording but little Satisfaction to
the Racks of Thought, which at this shocking Moment
hurry'd her wild Brain, she started up, and snatching
the Dagger, plung'd it thro' her Heart. He had
just Power to open his Eyes, and see the dreadful Reparation
she had made him, and then clos'd them for
ever. She lived some Hours to relate what she had
done, and the Cause that moved her to it, to some
Persons whom the Exclamations she made drew thither; 
but not long enough to see the Justice of Heaven
executed on Florez, who being fled from Venice
for a Murder he had been guilty of, was discover'd at
Rome, and there apprehended, and on the Account of
many other base Actions, wholly friendless, he suffer'd
the Law, and dy'd as much unpity'd, as Myrtano and
his unfortunate Mistress were the contrary.
