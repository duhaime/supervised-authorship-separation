Contains, besides other matters, some farther particulars relating to lady Hardy, which she did not think proper to make any mention of to Jemmy in the detail she had given him of her adventures. 
Dinner was no sooner over,—all the apurtenances of it removed, and the servants withdrawn, than Belpine began the little narrative he had promised, in these or the like terms: 
“It was always my custom, said he, even from my childhood, to go to Oxfordshire and pay my respects to my uncle three or four times every year; nor did I refrain continuing to give him this mark of my duty and affection after his marriage; though as you may suppose, it was an event which gave me great uneasiness. 
“The first time I saw my new aunt I found her busily employed in learning french, music, and dancing; she 
seem'd, and I believe really was, no less desirous of becoming mistress of those accomplishments than her fond husband was that she should be so, passing all those hours he suffer'd her from his presence either in reading some books which he had presented to her, or in the study of the lessons given her by her masters;—her behaviour was also full of humility and courtesy:—in a word, as much as I was prejudiced against her, which I confess I greatly was, I could see nothing in her to condemn during this visit, which lasted near three weeks, as unwilling that my uncle should think I took any umbrage at the change of his condition. 
“I went not down again till six months after, having been detain'd in London by a long fit of sickness, which it was thought would have been my last;—but,—good God, how strange a transformation had happen'd in the family in that time!—on my arrival—most of the old servants were removed, and new ones in their places;—all my aunt's preceptors were dismiss'd; and her ladyship, instead of the tractable obliging creature I had left her, was now grown haughty 
sullen and reserved, scarce spoke but in her husband's presence, and then with only an assumed softness:—in fine, every thing was the very reverse of what it had been, except my uncle himself, and he too, I thought, appeared less chearful and satisfied than usual. 
“But what the most amaz'd me was, to find that in the change of domesticks was included an old gentlewoman, who had lived with my uncle for seven or eight and twenty years in quality of a house-keeper, and being a distant relation of my father's, and reduced by misfortunes to go to service, had been recommended by my mother to take care of his affairs; which trust she so well discharged, and gave my uncle such content, that he used frequently to say, that as long as they both lived Jamison, for so she is call'd, and he should never part. 
“I took the liberty of asking my uncle what was become of her, but he only reply'd, that she was a foolish woman,—that he had discharged her,—and that he had done with her: —I rejoin'd, that I hoped she had been guilty of nothing to incur his displeasure.’ —‘I tell you, cried he, peevishly, she is a foolish impertinent woman,—say no more about her;’—I obey'd, but could not keep myself from putting some questions concerning her removal to those of the servants who had lived there in her time, but could get no other answer from any of them than a shake of the head, or a shrug of the shoulder. 
“All this increased my wonder; but on hearing she was at present boarded at a little farm-house about three or four miles off, I got one of my uncle's horses and went thither one morning, under pretence of riding for the air. 
“Notwithstanding the good creature received me with the greatest joy imaginable, I found the utmost difficulty in prevailing on her to acquaint me with the reason of her having left a place where she had been so useful as well as so much respected; and all I could get from her for a good while was, that sir Thomas had now no occasion for a house-keeper, having so good a lady, and such like evasive answers; which convincing me there was some mystery in the affair, made 
me the most sollicitous for an explanation. 
“I press'd, however, in such strong terms that she at last consented to satisfy me:” —‘Your aunt is a base woman, said she, and deserves to be exposed; but as ill as sir Thomas has used me I should be sorry that he should be made the jest of the county, therefore would not mention what I am going to relate to any person in the world besides yourself, nor even to you if I did not know you would be obliged, for your own sake, to keep it secret.’ 
“After this, she asked me if I did not remember that the last time I was down there was a young French Hugonot who made part of the family, and had been agreed with by sir Thomas to teach her ladyship the language for two guineas a month and his board. 
“I told her I knew very well there had been such a man, and she proceeded to inform me that this fellow presently grew a prodigious favourite with lady Hardy,—that she was always praising him, and was so extravagantly silly as even to ask the maids if they 
did not think monsieur La Noye was a very handsome man.” —‘This, said mrs. Jamison, occasion'd whispers in the family, which were little to her ladyship's advantage; but for my part I really look'd upon her behaviour as the effect of simplicity, and not of guilt, as some of them imagined, till happening to go into the best chamber to see if every thing was in order, as I had made it be clean'd the day before, who did I see there but my lady and this La Noye upon the bed together;—they had forgot, it seems, to fasten the door, and the posture I surprised them in admitted no doubt of their guilt; I was so thunder-struck that I had not the power to go either forward or backward, but stood motionless as a stock;—the fellow started up and rush'd by me out of the room,—my lady, you may be sure, was in confusion enough,—she ran to me, threw herself at my feet, burst into tears, and cry'd, “Dear Jamison don't betray me.” —‘Oh, madam, said I, I never thought to have seen what I have seen.’ —‘I was half asleep, rejoin'd she, when he came into the room, and I scarce knew what I did;—therefore, dear mrs. Jamison do not ruin me,—do not tell sir Thomas; 
—indeed I will never be guilty of the like again.’ 
“I could not forbear interrupting the good woman in this part of her story, said Belpine, by venting my indignation in a volley of curses on that scandal to our family; but she conjured me to moderate my passion; and resolve to shew no future marks of it, or protested she would reveal no farther; I gave my promise to do as she desired, and she went on.” 
‘The deceitful creature, resumed she, hung about me all the time she was speaking with such a shew of innocence and grief, that at last, I am ashamed to say it, her tears,—her seeming penitence,—her humiliation melted me into pity, and I promised never to mention what I had discovered, on condition she would never repeat her offence; and also that she should make some pretence to sir Thomas for getting the vile seducer of her honour removed out of the family. 
‘This she bound herself by the most solemn imprecation to perform;—but alas!—one day—another, and another, still came on, and pass'd away without 
any proof, or even probability of the sincerity of her conversion;—she took care, indeed, not to be surprised in the manner she had been; but I easily saw by sir Thomas's behaviour, and some words he let fall in casual conversation, that there was no thought of parting with this French fellow till her ladyship was made perfect in the language. 
‘I express'd my sentiments very plainly to her on this head, on which she told me that monsieur had not taken any freedoms' with her since the time I catch'd them together, and that he had sworn never to attempt the like again; and added, that though she would be glad to get rid of him, and could not endure the sight of him, yet she could find no excuse to make to sir Thomas for leaving off learning French till she was become mistress of it, which she was far from being as yet. 
‘This not satisfying me, I renewed my remonstrances to her as often as I had an opportunity; but I soon found that instead of working the effect I aimed at, she rather seem'd more hardened by them;—every time I spoke she answer'd in a more lofty strain; and at last told me that she would not be teaz'd;— 
that it was sufficient she did not repeat her fault, and as for the rest she knew what was proper to be done, and would not be kept in leading-strings by any servant of her husband's. 
‘I now plainly saw, that she was no less wicked though more wary than she had been; —I was troubled at the shame she would bring upon my master, and was debating within myself whether or not I should relate to him the discovery I had made, and all that had pass'd upon it between us, when an unforeseen accident saved me the pains of thinking any farther on the matter. 
‘Her ladyship, who, as you may suppose, was never much respected by the servants on account of her birth, became every day less so through the strong suspicion they had of her incontinency; but the insolence of her gallant was intolerable to all of them, especially to Humphrey, who being the oldest servant in the house, except myself, would not submit to the impertinent commands of that French renegado; this causing many quarrels, he resolved to leave sir Thomas's service; but, before he went, had an opportunity of revenging 
himself on those who were the occasion of his doing so. 
‘I was one morning with sir Thomas in his closet, settling my accounts, as I always did every month, when this Humphrey came running in and told him that my lady was in the summer-house at the farther end of the garden, and desired he would come to her that minute, for there was a great curiosity to be seen there.’ —‘Whatlittle fancy has she got in her head now, I wonder, said sir Thomas? but I'll go.’ —‘Your honour must come immediately, cried the fellow, or the sight will be gone. —Well, well, reply'd he, she must be humour'd;’—in speaking this he threw down the papers, and hurried away as fast as the burthen of his years would let him.’ 
‘I staid some little time in the closet expecting sir Thomas would soon return; but finding he did not, left it and went down: —I had just got to the bottom of the stairs when he came in follow'd by my lady,—both of them with countenances strangely discomposed.’ —‘Sirrah, said he, very angerly to Humphrey, who happen'd to be in the passage,—how dare you tell me that 
your lady wanted to speak with me in the summer-house?’ —‘Sir, reply'd the fellow, with the greatest assurance, —I saw my lady and the young Frenchman run thither very fast, so I thought there might be something very extraordinary to be seen,—so made bold to tell your honour of it.’ —‘You are an impudent rascal, cried sir Thomas, and went up stairs, still followed by my lady. 
‘I wonder'd what all this meant, but was soon after inform'd of the whole matter:—the fellow, it seems, being convinced in his own mind that my lady and this Frenchman were too great, had watch'd all their motions, and finding that they retir'd almost every morning into this summer-house, when they knew sir Thomas was reading, or otherwise employed in his closet, he had taken this method of giving the injured husband an opportunity of detecting them. 
‘I did not approve of Humphrey's proceeding in this point, and told him that let the matter be how it would, he must not hope to keep his place after what he had done; he reply'd, that he did not care how soon he was discharged,— 
that he had got money enough to set up an ale-house, and would not stay in any service where he must be insulted by people no better born than himself, and not half so honest.’ 
“Here, said Belpine, I could not forbear interrupting mrs. Jamison a second time, by asking how the shameful pair behaved on the approach of my uncle.” ‘—All that can be known of that part of the story, reply'd she, I was told by the gardener, who happened to be at work very near the place;—he said that sir Thomas, on finding the door made fast, knock'd and called to be let in, but no answer being made he beckoned the gardener to him, and bid him clamber up to the window and get in that way; but on his attempting to do so the door was opened by those within, and sir Thomas having gain'd entrance, the man withdrew and went again to his work;—he told me that the Frenchman came out in a few minutes looking very pale and discomposed, and that neither sir Thomas nor his lady appeared in a much better condition, though they staid some time after, as he supposed, to talk the business over. 
‘What pass'd between them on this score, pursued mrs. Jamison, is impossible to be known;—all that I can tell you is, that monsieur La Noye was dismiss'd entirely from the family within two hours after;—that my lady either was or pretended to be very sick, and sir Thomas appeared in a worse humour than ever I had seen him: —Humphrey was discharged that same day, and the next the poor gardener and two other servants, for what reason I know not, shared the same fate:—indeed, I little thought it would also have been mine; but all the distinction I had to boast of from the rest was, to be the last turn'd off.’ 
Belpine was going on, when Jemmy was called suddenly away to a gentle-woman, who his servant told him was very earnest to speak with him;—who this person was, and what her business, the reader shall not wait long to be inform'd.
