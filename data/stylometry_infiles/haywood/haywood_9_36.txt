Contains a brief recital of the resolutions taken on the foregoing advice. 
Among the many who made their addresses to miss Wingman, their was none who had been so likely to succeed as lord Huntley;—she respected him so well, that had the information against him come from any other hands than those it did, she would not have given the least credit to it, but she loved 
him not enough to reject the admonitions of her friends, or to make her hesitate one moment if she should believe him guilty, or refuse to condemn a person whom they had found worthy of it. 
Gay as she was by nature, she testify'd not the least reluctance to obey the commands of her mother in quitting Bath and all its pleasures, and resolved to do so without seeing lord Huntley before she went, or being at the pains of reproaching him with the crime he was accused of. 
But as she seem'd a little desirous that he should some way or other be made acquainted with her knowledge of his perfidiousness, and thought it as great an infringement of her mother's orders to write as to speak to him any more, lady Speck was so obliging as to tell her she would take that task upon herself at his next visit. 
Nor was it by this alone she proved the affection she had for her sister; —‘As you were intrusted to my care by my mother, said she, on our coming down to Bath, I am very loth to part with you till I have seen you safe again in her arms;—therefore, continued she, 
if miss Jessamy consents, I should be glad to return all together to London in the same manner as we left it.’ 
Nothing could have been more agreeable to Jenny than this proposal;—she was not now in a condition to relish the pleasures of Bath, and longed very much to return to a place where persons are at liberty either to see all the world or to live perfectly retired, as suits best with their humour or circumstances. 
‘I am charm'd with your ladyship's design, cried she, I could not have been easy to have seen miss Wingman torn from us in this manner; especially on an occasion which could not afford her any pleasing ideas for the companions of her journey.’ 
Miss Wingman made many acknowledgments to them both for this kind offer, but at first refused to accept it;—‘I think myself happy, added she, in the testimony you give me of your good nature and friendship towards me; but I cannot suffer you to think of leaving this place just in the height of the season, and returning to London, which is now a perfect wilderness, merely because 
cause I am obliged to go thither, by a duty which I cannot dispense with.’ 
It is not to be supposed reasonable that this young lady was much in earnest in what she said on this score;—the others, however, were too sincere to take her at her word;—and it was at last agreed that they should all set out together, as soon as every thing could be got ready for their departure. 
No company happening to come in, they pass'd the whole evening in Jenny's chamber, where the conversation turning chiefly on the discovery of lord Huntley's marriage, it suddenly came into lady Speck's head, that it would be better for her to express her sentiments on that occasion by a letter, than by holding any discourse with a man whom she could scarce think upon with any tolerable degree of patience. 
Miss Wingman approving of her intention, her ladyship took Jenny's standish, and immediately wrote to him in the following terms: 

To lord Huntley.
My Lord,
“It is with an infinity of astonishment, and little less concern, that I find your lordship's proposal of an alliance with our family, instead of an honour, is the greatest affront that could possibly be offer'd to it;—I thought my sister's birth, fortune, and character had set her above being attempted to be made the dupe either of a vicious inclination or an unmeaning gallantry; for to what else than to gratify one or the other of these propensities, can tend the addresses of a person who has already disposed of himself to another? 
“This, my lord, is sufficient to convince you that we are perfectly well acquainted with your marriage;—after which I cannot suppose you will even think of continuing your visits; the only reparation you can make for a proceeding so unworthy of you, being to shun henceforward the presence of my much injured sister, and also of all those who have any interest in her happiness or reputation; among the number of whom you cannot doubt 
is her who is sorry to subscribe herself, 
“My Lord,
Your lordship's
Ill-treated servant,
M. Speck.” 

This, after having shewn it to miss Wingman and Jenny for their approbation, she sent by a servant to be left for lord Huntley; but that nobleman coming not home till very late could do nothing in the affair that night; early the next morning lady Speck received a billet from him containing these lines: 
To lady Speck.
“Madam,
I Received yours with more astonishment than you could be capable of feeling at the motive which induced your ladyship to write to me in the manner you did;—so base, and withal so ridiculous a calumny, would have merited only my contempt, had it not reach'd the ears of persons for whom I have the greatest reverence: —Nothing is more easy than for me to clear 
my innocence in this matter; but as I cannot bear to appear even for one moment guilty in the eyes of my dear adorable miss Wingman, I beg your ladyship will give me the opportunity of justifying myself by letting me know the name of my accuser;—that villain, who while he stabs me in the back reaches my heart:—in confidence of your ladyship's generosity in this point I will wait on you as soon as I am dress'd, promising at the same time to intrude no more till this cruel aspersion is removed, and I shall be found to be what I truly am,—a man of honour, and, 
“With the most profound respect,
Madam,
Your ladyship's
Most humble
And most obedient servant,
Huntley.” 
The two sisters, who had imagined he would have been too much shock'd at the detection of his crime to have gone about to deny it, or to excuse it,—cried out, that he had an unparalell'd assurance; 
—that to behave in this manner was an aggravation of his guilt; and proved his soul as mean and abject as his principles were corrupt and base. 
But Jenny, who was always ready to think the best, and besides had the eyes of her reason less obscured by passion, began immediately to entertain more favourable sentiments;—she found something in this letter, which, in spite of all the appearances against him, made her believe there was a possibility of his being wrong'd;—she could not forbear communicating her opinion to the ladies; and urg'd in the defence of it these arguments: 
‘Lord Huntley is a man of sense, said she, and if he was so wicked as to be capable of acting in the manner that has been represented, he could not be so stupidly weak as to desire a farther explanation of it;—certainly he would rather be intirely silent on that head:—if guilty, what would his pretensions to innocence avail?—his making any noise in relation to a fact which, if true, may be so plainly proved, would only serve to make his criminal designs more conspicuous, and expose his villany 
to those who otherwise might hear nothing of it.’ 
‘All this is very true, my dear, reply'd lady Speck, but yet there are some men who have had the impudence and folly, not only to court but even actually marry a second wife while the former has been living, and perhaps too at less distance than 'tis likely lady Huntley was when he first made his addresses to my sister.’ 
‘It will not enter into my head, resumed Jenny, that lord Huntley is one of these,—nor can I think it quite just that a man should be absolutely condemn'd without a fair trial, or even knowing by whom he is accused.’ 
Lady Speck paus'd a little on these words, and then said,—that as she was certain sir Thomas Welby would not so positively assert a thing, the truth of which he was not well assured of, she was half inclined to grant lord Huntley's request, though it were only the more to confound him. 
Scarce had she done speaking in this manner when her woman came into the room, and told her that lord Huntley's 
servant who had brought the letter, and had waited all this time for an answer, begg'd to know if her ladyship had any commands to send by him;—to which, after a short consideration, she reply'd,—‘Yes,—he may tell his lord that I shall be at home.’ 
Miss Wingman had not open'd her mouth during this whole debate; but now shew'd, by her countenance, that she was not displeased at the result; and 'tis highly probable felt more impatience than she thought proper to express for what should pass in this important interview.
