A Friendship of a very ancient standing
having been between the Families of de
l' Amye and Douxmourie, it was mutually desir'd,
that the former having but one Son, and the
other no more Children than two Daughters, the
Amity between them might be preserv'd by his
Marriage with one of them—The eldest of
them, being most favour'd by her Father, was the
Person propos'd, and old de l' Amye agreeing to
it, every thing was concluded on before the Inclinations
of the Parties themselves were consulted:
The young Gentleman, who had been on his Travels,
tho' he was every Day expected home, did
not return till some Months after this Affair was
settled; so that his intended Bride had much the
Advantage of him, in knowing to whom she was
ordain'd. —The Expectations that she would
be a very considerable Match, being Coheiress
with her Sister of a vast Estate, join'd to her other
Accomplishments, had attracted a great number of
Admirers, all which her Father oblig'd her to dismiss, 

and told her he had provided a Husband for
her, whose Quality and Fortune were what he approved
of, and whose personal Merits were not to
be equalled by any of those who pretended a Passion
for her: Nor was it from her Father alone
she received this Character of him, several Gentlemen,
who had accompanied him to some of
those Courts, which he had visited for Improvement,
being returned before him, reported him
to be grown a perfect Master of all those Accomplishments
which can render a Man truly valuable. 
The thing was publickly talk'd of, all her Acquaintance
wish'd her Joy of a Happiness which
was look'd upon as good as compleated, and among
them there were not a few who wou'd
have rejoyced to have had a possibility of putting
themselves in her place, and envy'd her more for
the good Fortune she was to enjoy in the Possession
of so charming a Husband, than for the
Dowry she received from her Father. She, who
had a Heart intirely unprepossess'd with any other
Object, was perfectly satisfied with the Choice had
been made for her; and tho' it cou'd not be said
she was in love with one whose Person she had never
seen, yet 'tis certain, that from the prodigious
Character she had heard of him, she had form'd
so great an Idea of Happiness in being his Wife,
that she obey'd the Commands of her Father in
resolving to become so with an Inclination, at least,
equal to her Duty. 
At length, the long-expected Charmer was arriv'd; 
and as soon as the first Demonstrations of
Joy for his Return were over, was inform'd by
his Father of what he had concluded on for him:
The old Gentleman did not fail to represent the
Advantages of such a Match in Colours the most
agreeable, and extoll'd the Merits of the Lady he
design'd for him to so high a Degree, that a youthful
Heart, naturally amorous, was easily inflam'd 

by so elegant a Description—The Fatigue of
his Journey had not taken from him that Impatience
and Curiosity which such an Occasion commonly
inspires: He was eager to see her, and desir'd
he might be introduc'd immediately. His
Father, overjoy'd to find him in a Humour so
much dispos'd to Obedience, comply'd with his
Request, and they went together to the House of
Mcnsieur Douxmourie. Old de l' Amye being
told he was gone to take a Walk in his Garden,
went to seek him there, leaving his Son in
the Parlour till his Return, little imagining what
Event that short Time of his Absence would bring
forth. The youngest of the Douxmourie's
having heard the Congratulations which had been
paid to her Sister on the account of her intended
Marriage, and the Admiration every one that knew
him had express'd of the graceful Person and Behaviour
of him who was to be the Husband, had
a Desire, which indeed had something more in it
than Curiosity, to see him: and being told by
some of the Servants that he was below, resolv'd
to be a Witness of what so many had alledg'd in
his favour: She had the better Opportunity of doing
it, because her Sister was that Afternoon gone
out to make some Visits: Therefore coming into
the Room where he was, with a Gaiety and Freedom
which is pretty common among the French
Ladies, struck his Fancy, at first sight, with something
to her Advantage, which she was far from
expecting. He no sooner saw her, than he wish'd
she might be the Person his Father had made
choice of for him; and his Travels having furnish'd
him with a good Quantity of Assurance,
tho' no more than what is agreeable, provided
the Person possess'd of it knows how to temper it
with Good Manners, he presently made her sensible
how happy he should think himself if she
were the Daughter of Monsieur Douxmourie. 

Young as she was, she was not so dull of Apprehension
as not to understand him; but perceiving
he either Had not been made acquainted, or had
forgot that there were two of them, forbore to
remind him, prompted thereto by some secret Dictates,
to which as yet she was herself a Stranger
to the meaning of; and only answering him
in the Affirmative, that she had the Honour to call
that Gentleman Father, prevented him from giving
any Check to the Passion which was just then
kindled in his Soul: and thinking himself the happiest
Man on Earth, to find in one Person all that
cou'd indulge his Love, and at the same time gratify
his Interest and his Duty, was too much
transported to restrain his Joy, or wait the dull
Formality of her being presented to him: but telling
her who he was (which she knew well enough
before) and asking her if she had never heard of
such a Man, who had been flatter'd with the hope
that he should, one Day, be blest in the possession
of the Daughter of Douxmourie: Yes,
Monsieur, (answer'd she, blushing, and with an
Air which still confirm'd him she was the Person he
wish'd, and also that the sight of him had given her
Emotions, in some measure, proportion'd to those he
felt for her) I am, indeed (said she) the Daughter
of Douxmourie, nor are you deceiv'd in
your Conjecture, if you imagine I have heard
enough of de l' Amye to make me impatient for
his coming. He was about to reply to these obliging
Words, in Terms full of Tenderness, when
the coming in of both their Fathers prevented either
of them from proceeding. After the first Civilities
were over, Monsieur Douxmourie began
to speak of the Happiness he propos'd in
uniting their Families; and young de l' Amye assur'd
him, that, in providing for him in this manner,
he thought himself under greater Obligations
to his Father, than for all he ever did, or wou'd 

do for him besides. You are infinitely gallant,
reply'd Monsieur; and I hope, if what you tell me
be your real Sentiments, you will have no occasion
to alter them when you see my Daughter, who,
not appriz'd of the Honour of a Visit from you,
happens to be abroad; but I have sent for her,
and I know she will be here immediately. What
mean you Sir? (interrupted de l' Amye, strangely
surpriz'd) is not this Lady your Daughter! One of
them (resum'd the other;) but she that the discerning
Eyes of your rightly-judging Father has pointed
out for you, as much exceeds her in all the
Perfections of Mind and Body, as this might seem
to do an untaught tawny Ethiope. It is not to be
imagin'd what an Alarm these Words gave the
Person they were address'd to—He hardly
could recover himself so far as to be able to
make any Answer, and when he did, it was in
this manner: I doubt not (said he coldly) but that
all your Family have Excellencies peculiar to themselves
—but I should never wish a nobler Satisfaction,
than what is in the power of this young
Lady to bestow. Had a disinterested Person been
present, it would have been pleasant enough to
have observ'd the Surprize and Vexation which appear'd
in the Faces of the two old Gentlemen— 
They stood for some time looking on one another
in a fix'd Posture, as if some supernatural Event
had happen'd, which had depriv'd them of the
Power of Speech, till the Father of him who had
been the Occasion of it, first broke Silence in these
or the like Expressions—You must pardon (said
he) the Deference which my Son has Gallantry enough
to pay to the present Fair—He has travell'd,
you know, and that sort of Education generally
inspires a Desire of becoming pleasing to
all—I hope he is better acquainted with my
Intentions, than to prefer, in reality, any to her I
have appointed for him—Aye, aye, cry'd the 

other, it is all owing to this forward Girl—Leave the
Room! (continu'd he, turning to his Daughter, who
had been all this while trembling with Confusion
and Uncertainty how to behave in this Affair) be
gone! —You are too young for Conversations
such as we are upon. Tho' by what after ensu'd,
one may believe she wou'd have given her Soul
almost to have staid; she was kept in too much
Awe by the Severity of her Father, to dare to disobey
him, and she went away in Tears; which so
seesibly touch'd de l' Amye, that not all the Respect
he ow'd to the Presence of his Father wou'd
have been able to have restrain'd him from uttering
a much greater Part of his Sentiments, than yet
he had done, if the immediate Entrance of that
Lady, for whose sake the other had been treated
in this manner, had not made it improper: She no
sooner appear'd, than, after having paid a civil
Respect to the two Strangers, she ask'd her Father
what had occasion'd his Commands for her Return
home. That, reply'd he, which I doubt not but
all here will at last think themselves happy in. 
In speaking these Words, he presented her to
de l' Amye; and, for form sake, told her who he
was, tho' the Servant who was sent for her had
before related the News. 
Nothing could be more dazling than the
Appearance of this Lady; her Person was every
way agreeable, she had the finest Hair and Complexion
in the World, her Features were perfectly
regular; nor could the nicest Eye find a Defect
either in her Face or Shape, unless that she were
something too tall; but then there was an Air of
Majesty about her, which little People very rarely
can boast, and which made her appear extremely
charming—To all that Nature had bestow'd,
Art had done its utmost to embelish her: she was
dress'd in so rich as well as becoming a manner,
as might easily inform those that saw her, there 

was nothing wanting from her own Care for the one,
or Indulgence of her Father for the other. But not
all the Attractions she was Mistress of, were suffient
to make her appear half so amiable in the Eyes
of de l' Amye, as did her Sister: there was an easy
Freedom in the Behaviour, a winning Softness in
the Air and Face of that young Creature, tho'
dress'd in a more plain Apparel, and not set off with
any Illustration, which took more with him, and he
continu'd to think her infinitely more lovely in her
native Charms, than this, adorn'd in all the gawdy
Pomp of Finery, and Blaze of Jewels. The Passion
he was possess'd of for the other, and the Reflection
how indifferently she had been used on the
account of this, work'd so strongly in his Soul,
that he had scarce power enough over himself to
pay her even those common Compliments, which
cou'd not be omitted without ill Manners— 
In fine, the little be said to her appear'd so sorc'd,
so different from what is dictated by the Heart,
that a Person far less capable of judging than she
was, might easily perceive he was little influenc'd
in the manner she expected. By the Description I
have given of her, I believe my Reader will not
imagine her to be the humblest of her Sex; tho',
had she been such, a Disappointment like this was
sufficient to rouze the smallest Sparks of Pride, and
kindle up Resentment; but as she really was of a
Humour perhaps the least inclinable to pardon an
Indignity of this kind, of all others, she grew all
Fury, and her tumultuous Thoughts meditated nothing
but Revenge: but if his not loving her had
power to raise such a Tempest of Rage in her
Soul, to what an infinite Degree did the Know-ledge
(which she soon after receiv'd) that it was
to the more prevailing Charms of her Sister she
ow'd this Mortification, transport her! All that can
be conceiv'd of Violent, was mean to that with
which her haughty Temper was agitated. The 

poor young Lady felt the Effects of it; her Father
was so much inrag'd, that by her showing herself,
the Match might probably be broken off between
de l' Amye and his favourite Daughter, that he
wou'd not suffer her to come in his sight; but
order'd she should stay in her Chamber, whence
he vow'd she should never come out, unless it
were to be dispos'd in a Monastery, without de
l' Amye, repenting the Declarations be had made
in her favour, consented to the Consummation of
what his Father had agreed upon for him— 
Nor was this all the Hardship she endur'd; she was
deny'd Ease in her Confinement, her Sister was
perpetually coming in to insult her, and whenever
any Company or Business gave her a small Cessation
from this Vexation, her own disturb'd Thoughts
were sufficiently her Tormentors—She
lov'd the charming de l' Amye, tho' she had seen
him but once, with a Passion as fierce, as violent,
as her Soul naturally mild and gentle was capable
of admitting. And the Impossibility there was.
that her Father ever shou'd be brought to consent
she shou'd be his, to the prejudice of her Sister,
even tho' he should really like her well enough,
to continue giving her the Preference in his Inclinations,
I believe, by all who have experienc'd
that Passion, will be allow'd to be a Torture poynant
enough to break a Heart more resolute
than her's. 
While the Family of Douxmourie were
in these Perplexities, that of de l' Amye was not
much better: the young Gentleman plainly told
his Father, he never would marry the Person propos'd,
and obstinately refus'd making any more
Visits to that House, unless he might be admitted
to pay his Addresses to the youngest Daughter. 
This created many Arguments between them; and
neither of them being able to overcome the Resolution 

of the other, the whole Affair, for some
time, continu'd in suspence. 
Old de l' Amye at length having, for many
Reasons, a prodigious Desire his Son should marry
into that Family, endeavour'd to persuade Monsieur
Douxmourie to give his Consent that
he should have her he seem'd most to approve; 
but he was too partially fond of his other Daughter,
to listen to such a Proposal: and since he had no
other way to revenge the Contempt she had been
treated with, encreas'd his ill Usage of her Rival
Sister in such a manner, that she would not have
been able to have supported it with Life, had
Heaven not sent her a Relief, by taking him away
in whose power alone she was. He was taken
suddenly ill of a violent Fever, and died in three
days: but the approach of Death made but little
Alteration in his Sentiments; he did not indeed
wholly cut off his younger Daughter of a Child's
Part in his Estate, but left her far inferior to her
Sister, and that too to be forfeited if she marry'd
de l' Amye. 
She was now, however, her own Mistress; 
and 'tis not to imagin'd that when she was so, she
wou'd continue in the same House with a Sister,
whose unforgiving Temper had cost her, so much
Uneasiness: She took Lodgings in the Town, and
being still possess'd of her former Passion, tho' as
hopeless as ever of gratifying it, sent to let
de l' Amye know she shou'd take it as a Favour if
she saw him among the number of those who came
to console an unhappy Orphan. —This
Summons was too kind a one for a Man of his
Gallantry to refuse, had he been less in Love; but
still retaining the same Desire which the first Sight
of her had inspired him with, tho' now degenerated
to a less noble Aim, he obeyed with a speed
which testified the Pleasure he took in it: The
former Tenderness with which they had regarded 

each other, encreasing by a nearer Conversation,
both became, at length, too much overcome by it,
to have the Government any longer of their Actions. 
—And, to what Extremes will mutual
Love transport its Votaries? —They yielded
to the all-commanding Force—gave up their
Souls as Victims to his Sway—and prov'd that
it was not in the power of the inexorable Douxmourie
to deprive them of any other part of
the Joys of Marriage than the Ceremony. The
Consequence of this was, what might naturally be
expected, the Censure of the World, and a living
Proof that those Censures were not undeserv'd; but
in spite of those too, which must be reckon'd stabbing
Afflictions to a Woman who has any Pretence
to Honour or Reputation, the generous Fair had
too great a Tenderness for her lovely Undoer, to
press him to take off the Reproach she suffer'd by
making her his Wife. —A noble Friendship
went hand in hand with the Passion she had for
him, which would not suffer her to wish he should
take to his Arms a Bride unportion'd; nor indeed,
as his Affairs stood, great part of his Father's
Estate being involv'd, could he have done it, without
bringing manifest Destruction on himself, and
her he married. But the Case stood not in this
manner with the Sieur le Blessang. He, tho'
infinitely superior to her in Fortune, wou'd have
thought himself happy, would she have yielded to
be his Wife; and when she heard the Rumour
that every one's mouth was full of, of her Intimacy
with de l' Amye, he was the last that believ'd it; 
nor, perhaps, never would have done so, if her
Sister, who hated her more deadly, since she knew
the continued Tenderness de l' Amye still had for
her, and was ever watchful to expose her, had not
contriv'd a Stratagem, to give him ocular Demonstration. 
She persuaded him to dress like a Footman,
and under the Pretence of bringing a Letter 

from that happy Lover, he easily got Admittance
into the House, where the unfortunate Lady was
in her Child Bed. —That Secret being also discover'd
by the Spies of that assiduous Contriver of
Dissension. —Having gain'd Entrance, Love,
Curiosity, Jealousy, and a Resolution of being
satisfied of the Truth, emboldened him to follow
the Maid that carried up the Letter; and found
her, indeed, as he had been inform'd, and the undeniable
Testimony of what she had been guilty of,
lying on the Bed by her. The Surprize he was in,
in spite of all had been told him, to see her really
in that Condition, was so great, that he had power
to utter no more than, O! cou'd I have thought
it! —Cou'd I have thought it!—and then
ran down Stairs immediately—the Confusion
she was in, at seeing a Fellow at her Bedside,
and the Oddness of his Behaviour, hindred her
from ordering he shou'd be stay'd—but
when she open'd the Letter, and found it only a
Blank, she perceiv'd she had been betray'd, and
was immediately seiz'd with so violent a Disorder,
that it threw her into Fits, which had like to have
been fatal to her. There let us leave her for a
while, and return to the enrag'd Lover, Monsieur
Blessang—He had no means of venting
his Indignation on her who had so ungratefully
repaid his generous Affection, but he cou'd not
bear the Man who deprived him of her Affections
shou'd live; he therefore writes a Challenge immediately
to Monsieur de l' Amye, who, though
he cou'd not guess by what way he had affronted
a Gentleman who was altogether a Stranger to
him, had too much Bravery to refuse meeting
him, and went to the Place, and at the Hour appointed
—It was natural enough, before they
encounter'd, to enquire the Cause which had provok'd
him to send a Billet of that nature; which
the other answer'd with all Frankness imaginable, 

telling him the whole Secret by which he had discovered
the Amour. —But, said he, (not yet
able to vanquish the Tenderness he had for her) tho'
she is for ever lost to me, and with her all my
Soul holds dear, so precious is her Fame, and
Peace of Mind to me, that if you will swear to
recompence the Injury you have done her, by
an honourable Marriage, I am willing to pass over
my own Misfortune in Consideration of her
Happiness, and will here change Vows with you,
never to molest your Peace—de l' Amye, tho'
'tis possible he might, after Possession, have had
Gratitude enough to have done every thing in his
power for her Ease, knew very well his Circumstances
would not admit of his marrying in that
manner; but either not willing to let the other into
that Secret, or believing all he cou'd say on that
seore would seem but as a Pretence to avoid fighting,
thought it better absolutely to refuse it— 
This threw off all the Good-will Monsieur Blessang
before had to an Accommodation; and,
drawing his Sword—Now, said he, nothing shall
protect thee from me; I fight not now to satiate my
Revenge on a Rival, but to punish a Villain, a
base Violater of Innocence—Have-at-thee,
then, continued he, (making a Pass at him—)
Defend thyself, if thou canst, against the Cause of
Justice, and of injur'd Virtue. He made his first
Push with so much Fury and Skill, that de l' Amye
stood in need of all his Dexterity to parry it; but
having soil'd him once or twice, and by this time
equally enrag'd, gave a home Thrust, with these
Words—This, cry'd he, to show how little I
deserve the Contumely thy rash mistaken Rage
has branded me with—The unhappy Blessang
cou'd answer to these Upbraidings no otherwise
than with a Groan, which was indeed his
last; for that Moment put a Period at once to his
Love, Life, and Indignation. Monsieur de l' Amye 

was exceedingly troubled at this Accident, not only
because he had robb'd the World of a Gentleman
whose Life might have been of Service to
it, but also that he knew he had too many powerful
Friends for him to hope to obtain a Pardon for
the Misfortune he had been the cause of to them— 
As he was reflecting a little on the Vexations
which frequently arise from giving way to that
Bane of Quiet, Love, he saw three or four People
cross hastily over an adjacent Field, and seem to
be coming directly to the Place where he was
standing by the dead Body of him who so unluckily
had fallen by his hand. Self-preservation put him
in mind that this was no fit Place for Contemplation; 
and turning another way into a Road, the
Entrance of which he knew very well, he made
the best of his way to the Lady for whose sake all
this had happen'd: he found her very ill, and not
in a Condition to be acquainted with what he had
to deliver, therefore was obliged to leave her; 
zealously entreating the Care of all about her,
designing, if she recover'd, to write an account of
all to her, as soon as he shou'd be in a Place of
Safety; which not believing was to be found in
France, he took Shipping immediately, and embark'd
for Flanders; where when he had landed,
he sent Letters to his Father, and some others
whom he cou'd confide in, desiring they would
let him know, by Post, every thing that pass'd
concerning the Death of Monsieur Blessang. 
The first Answers he receiv'd, were little to his
Consolation, tho' no less than he expected: The
Persons whom he saw in the Field, were brought
by the Servant who was employ'd in carrying the
Challenge; who, imagining what it might contain,
had come in hope to have prevented the Mischief; 
and finding they were too late, went that moment
to a Magistrate, and gave in an Information— 
He also was informed that great Search had been 

made for him, and that he must never expect to
see France again, unless he meant the Visit should
be fatal to him—But in the midst of all these
sad Accounts, he had this to comfort him, that his
Father was very busy with all those who were accounted
Favourites at Court; that he spar'd no
Cost nor Trouble to procure a Pardon; and that
there were some among them, who had given him
hope of succeeding. 
This Misfortune was very terrible to old Monsieur
de l' Amye, not only because it depriv'd him
of the Pleasure of his dear Son's Company, but
also that it was the tearing to pieces of his already
broken Estate: and the Trouble and Fatigue it occasion'd
him, was such, as was very near bringing
him to his Grave. 
But what Tongue is able to express the Grief,
the Distraction of the unfortunate Cause of all this
Woe, when first she heard the fatal News: Had
it not been prevented by the watchful Care of those
about her, she wou'd not have liv'd a Moment to
endure the Obloquy of the World, and those severer
Stings of Conscience which she now began
to feel, for having, by her ill Conduct, occasion'd
such Scenes of Death and Ruin—The Idea of
the unhappy Blessang was ever in her mind; 
and at some times Imagination work'd so strongly
on her perplex'd Thoughts, as to make her think
she saw him. She continued for some time in a
Condition little different from Madness; but when
Reason had a little recovered its usual Sway, a
deadly Melancholy succeeded Passion; and tho' she
had frequent Letters from de l' Amye, in which
he press'd her to come to Flanders, she cou'd not
be prevail'd on to repeat that Folly which had
caus'd such Misfortunes in the World, and which
she now accounted as a Crime unpardonable: But
to do all she cou'd to expiate it, after putting her
Child, which happen'd to be a Boy, under the Care 

of a Fryar, of whose Goodness and Piety she was
well assured, she retir'd into a Convent, where she
resolv'd to pass the Remainder of her Days in Penitence. 
Her haughty Sister all this while exulted
in triumphant Vengeance; but aiming still at the
Life of de l' Amye, she join'd her Interest, which
was pretty considerable, with the Relations of the
Sieur Blessang, the better to render fruitless
all the Endeavours the unhappy Father cou'd make
in his Son's behalf—But, at last, notwithstanding
all the Efforts of Malice, he succeeded; a Pardon
was sign'd, and he call'd home: It would be
needless to repeat the mutual Transports of the
overjoy'd Father and Son at meeting; whoever
will give themselves leisure to think what they
would feel in such a Circumstance, need not be inform'd
—It had however been more pure, if
not mix'd by the melancholy Reflection how much
this Accident had impoverish'd their Fortune; and
by making so many Enemies, took from the young
Gentleman all Hope of repairing it, as he once
designed by getting a Place at Court: but being
inform'd of the Particulars of all that had been
done in his Absence, he resolv'd at least to gratify
one Passion; and putting on a Countenance as full
of Gaiety as he cou'd, went to make a Visit to her
whom his Indifference had made his implacable
Enemy, Madamoiselle Douxmourie. The Surprize
which appear'd in the Face of the Servant
who open'd the Door to him, gave him a sort of
gloomy Satisfaction, not doubting but he shou'd
create a much greater in the Lady he serv'd. He
was not mistaken in his Sentiments; she no sooner
was told he enquir'd for her, than a cold Sweat
came all o'er her Limbs; she trembled like one
in a Palsy, and not able to imagine what shou'd
have occasion'd his coming, was not without a
Thought, that repenting his Contempt of her, he
meant to entreat her Pardon, and perhaps endeavour 

to expiate his former Coldness by a Declaration
of Love. This was too agreeable a Belief
for her to oppose it: For de l' Amye having had
the same Charms for her as for almost all her Sex
besides, and her Hatred having only been occasion'd
by his not loving her, such a Suggestion
gratified more than one Passion in her: therefore,
looking in her Glass, and setting herself in that Air
which she thought would be most engaging, she
went down to receive him with a Pleasure, which
those who knew the Violence with which she had
express'd herself against him, would scarcely have
believed. But how was she mortified, how much
more insupportable was this second Disappointment,
than the first he had given her; when instead
of accosting her with humble Looks, and
Words all compos'd of Sweetness and Persuasion,
as she expected, he offered her nothing but Insults,
and reproach'd her for her Inhumanity to a
Sister, who he told her was infinitely more deserving
than herself, in Terms so bitter, and so severely
just, that tho' she could ill endure to hear
them, her secret Soul avowed what he alledg'd,
and join'd to torture her. This Self-Condemnation
abated great part of the Fury his first Salutati-had
put her in, and at length, she either was, or
fancy'd herself to be, truly sorry for what she had
done, and opening all her Bosom, made no Scruple
of confessing the Source of all the Mischief. 
She confess'd it was not Pride for the Preference
he gave her Sister, which had alone stirr'd up her
Resentment, but that Love, jealous, disappointed
Love! had at least an equal Share in driving her
to those Extremes she had been guilty of. —And
at last fell so low, as to tell him, that if he yet
cou'd bring himself to return the Passion she felt
for him, she would repair the Losses she had occasioned
in his Fortune, by giving him her own,
and by publickly marrying him, testify to the whole 

World from what Original the Hatred she had shewed
to him had sprung: 'Tis impossible to describe
with what a Look de l' Amye listen'd to this unexpected
Offer; all that can be conceived of
Scorn, Contempt, and Detestation, were to the
Life display'd in his expressive Eyes—but, as
if they were not intelligible enough—Weak,
vile Woman! (said he) as mean-spirited as base! 
Can you believe that I, who, when unknowing
the foulness of your Mind, could find no Charm
about your Person worthy my Regard, can now
descend to take a Wretch who wants but Opportunity
and the Temptation of the Devil to be a
Witch? —No—did but one Thought agree
—should I forgo my Principles, renounce
my Honour, and debase my Nature but even so
far—cou'd I but hesitate, if for a sordid Consideration
I shou'd take to my Arms so loathed a
Creature, I shou'd indeed be only fit for thee— 
but I too much despise thee to think whatever thou
canst offer worth a Moment's serious Consideration
—thou art now grown as much beneath my
Resentment, as thou art unworthy of my Pity. I
cannot have the same Sentiments for you (reply'd
she, fiercely, and running at him with a Penknife
which she happened to have in her Pocket) nor shalt
thou live to triumph over both the Daughters of
Douxmourie. 
She was very near plunging it into his Body,
before he saw what it was she had in her Hand; 
and had not a Chair, by catching hold of her
Sleeve, a little retarded the Speed with which she
flew to him, he had inevitably fallen a Victim to
her Fury; but easily disarming her, when he perceived
what she was about, Wretch! (cry'd he,
if possible with an added Scorn to that with which he
had before look'd on her) Fortune will no longer assist
the Mischiefs thou art form'd to execute. — 
Thou hast already done all to me thou ever can'st 

have power to do, by depriving me of thy Sister,
and forcing my unwilling Arm to rob the World
of so accomplish'd a Gentleman as the Sieur
Blessang. —I now despise whatever Efforts
thy future Malice may make against me—and
leave thee an Object at once meanly despicable, and
transcendently wicked. With these Words he flung
out of her House, resolved to hear no more, had
she attempted to speak; but the over-boiling Passions
of her Sou! suffer'd not themselves to be
discharg'd in Words, but rising all at once, suffocated
her, and she was found by her Servants in
a Swoon. 
To repeat the many Stratagems she afterwards
form'd for his Destruction, would be as tiresome
as impertinent, since none of them for a long
time met with Success; and she had the inexpressible
Mortification to see him in a small time married
to a young Widow vastly rich, part of whose
Wealth paid off the Mortgages of the Estate which
was to descend to him, and they lived together on
the Remainder in a manner more grand than ever
he had done before. 
But now the Time was come at once to prove
how dangerous it is to have a watchful Enemy,
tho' ne'er so known a one, and to make Lasselia
sensible how much she had deceiv'd herself
by false Reasoning when she concluded that Errors,
such as she was guilty of, were little taken
notice of by Heaven. The implacable Douxmourie,
out of humour with the World, which
afforded her a Gratification neither of her Love
nor Resentment, was going into the Country to
indulge a Discontent she cou'd not have so much
leisure to do at Paris. In the Road to the Place
she was going to, was that Inn in which de l' Amye
had plac'd his belov'd Lasselia. It was the
effect of the other's Ill-fortune, that she happened
to bait there, and a little more fatigued than 

ordinary, resolved to go no farther that Day. 
Lasselia, who while the Sun was up, ne'er
dared to peep abroad, used commonly to take the
benefit of the Air in an adjacent Field every
Evening: She was in one of those nocturnal Refreshments
when Madamoiselle Douxmourie,
who in leaving Paris, had not left her Disquiets,
weary of sitting alone in her Chamber, and it being
too early to go to Bed, went to take a little
Walk, accompany'd only by her Woman, whom
she had taken along with her. It was their Chance
to go into that very Field, which being very near
the House, made it not unsafe for them to venture
without any other Guard than their own Voices; 
which, if they were assaulted, might easily bring
People to their Assistance. They had walk'd but
a little way in it, before they fancy'd they stood
in need of Protection; they heard a rustling among
the Leaves on the other side of the Hedge,
and presently after a muttering of Voices; they
immediately imagined there were Robbers near
them, and presently began to run back, crying all
the way, Thieves, Thieves! —Help! Help! or
we shall be murder'd in a Moment. There were
immediately twenty People about them from the
Inn, and some little Cottages which stood near
it—What's the matter? Where are the Thieves? 
Bawl'd they all out with one Voice—O! just
in that Thicket (reply'd Douxmourie, pointing
toward the Place where she had heard the Sound)— 
'Tis not to be doubted but they ran in hope of a
certain Reward, which had been allow'd to all who
had the good Fortune to take any of these lawless
Adventurers. Douxmourie was so much out
of breath with her Fright, that she was obliged to
rest on her Woman's Arm, before she cou'd go
any farther; and she was not got into the House,
when the Mob, her Outcries had rais'd, were returned:
She stopp'd a little to know their Success 

—for Fear had magnif, 'd the Noise she
heard to such a Degree, that she thought there
were at least a hundred of them that made it— 
See, Madam (cry'd one of the Fellows) for what
Cause you have been alarm'd—there were no
Thieves; you have only made us interrupt a loving
Couple—but, however, since we have been at
the pains of taking them, we'll e'en carry them before
their Betters—they shall give an Account
who they are, and what Business they had there,
before we part with them It was to no purpose
that the Gentleman endeavour'd, by mild Arguments
(for to have made use of Force, would have
been Madness) to prevail on this rude Multitude,
to let him and the Person he had with him, who
was dying with her Fears, go about their Business. 
They were obstinately bent, and all his Eloquence
was thrown away on them. Douxmourie was
all the while they were talking, in the greatest
Consternation imaginable; she fancy'd she knew
the Voice of him who had fallen into this Misfortune,
but cou'd not recollect where, or when she
had heard it before; and the Moon being pretty
obscure, and the Press of People who encompass'd
him round, would not give her leave to see his
Face, till being all come near the Inn, the People
themselves running out with Lights, she immeliately
saw, to her inexpressible Surprize, as
well as Joy, that it was the Object of her Hatred,
Monsieur de l' Amye, and with him a Woman of
a very good Appearance, (for Lasselia had
long ago thrown off her Pilgrims Habit) but that
distracted Lady, willing to conceal herself as long
as she cou'd, holding a Handkerchief to her Eyes,
took from the other the means of knowing her,
which else she must infallibly have done, having
often seen her at Madam de Montespan's; but
this she was certain of, that it was not his Wife,
by the difference of her Shape and Stature; Lasselia 

being a great deal taller, and something more
slender than Madamoiselle de l' Amye, whom before
her Marriage she had been intimately acquainted with. 
The Master and Mistress of the House were
very much vex'd at this Accident, not expecting
any other, than that by this Discovery Monsieur
de l' Amye wou'd be oblig'd to carry his Mistress
and Generosity to some other Place: but to bring
them off as well as they cou'd, they told the Rabble
that they might disperse themselves, for they
wou'd be answerable for the Character of those
Persons, that the Lady was a near Relation of
their own, and the Gentleman an Acquaintance
who sometimes call'd to see them—Thus,
with much ado, the Lovers at last had their Liberty; 
but were extremely perplex'd, lest this Affair
should get Air. De l' Amye cou'd not be certain
that, among such a Number of People, there were
not some who might know him; but that was the
smallest of their Vexations; Lasselia had till
then been conceal'd with that Caution, that not a
Servant in the House, but one, whose Fidelity the
Mistress of it was secure of, knew there was any
Woman lodg'd there, a Passage being made for
her on purpose out of her Chamber into the Fields; 
and she never stirring but when it was dark, prevented
her from being seen by any Body. 
But it was now natural to suppose, that being
found with him, and afterwards own'd as a Relation
by the Inn-keeper, would create Suspicion enough
in those sort of People; therefore they concluded
that it would be wholly improper for her
to continue there. But whither to remove her, he
could not for his Soul contrive; tho' had he known
how dangerous an Enemy he had in the House,
and who had been both the Occasion and Witness
of the Bustle which had happen'd, 'tis certain they
would rather have chose to have shelter'd themselves
that Night under the Boughs of some spreading 

Oak, than tarry'd under the same Roof with
her. But the malicious Douxmourie, to have
the better Opportunity of compleating the Mischief
she intended, withdrew the Moment she had
seen his Face; which, by the Advantage of the
Lights being brought behind her to the Place where
they were, she cou'd easily do, before he cou'd,
if the Distraction he was in would have given him
leave, have perceiv'd her. 
She went presently to her Chamber; but having
several Servants with her, she order'd them:
to watch about the House, and bring her word of
all the Motions of those two Persons: and being
inform'd by the most diligent among them, that,
for a certainty, that Gentleman and Woman lay
both of them there, she pretended on a sudden to
be taken extremely ill, and that not expecting to live
an Hour, she must send for some Friends she had
in that Country; so ordering a Horse to be got
ready, that Footman who had brought her this Intelligence,
having his Message given him privately,
was dispatch'd to the House of Madam de l' Amye,
where he was to tell her, that he belong'd to a
Gentleman who had the greatest Concern imaginable
for her ill Usage; and had sent to inform
her, that her Husband having an Intention wholly
to abandon her in a short time, of late had been
very busy in disposing of some Lands, which Money
he had made a Present to a young Girl, whom
he was excessive fond of, that he design'd to live
with her as his Wife; and as a Proof of the Truth
of all this, she might that Night find them together
at such an Inn—But that, if she requir'd
this Testimony, she must not lose this Opportunity,
which probably might never offer again— 
Madamoiselle Douxmourie charg'd him, if
possible, to fire her with a desire of coming
immediately, because she was not sure how
long they might stay. It was scarce a quarter of 

an Hour's riding to the House of de l' Amye; and
telling the Servants he had Business of greater Consequence
than Life to impart to their Lady, she
order'd he should be admitted, tho' she had on
her Night-dress, and was preparing for Bed— 
The Fellow perform'd the Business he was sent
about with so much Art, that she presently assented
to the Proposal of going that Moment to detect
her Husband, on whose Ingratitude and Perfidiousness
she bestow'd ten thousand Curses; but
not thinking it proper to go alone, especially with
this Man, who was altogether a Stranger to her,
she sent to Monsieur de Valier, and rouz'd him
and his Lady, desiring they would come to her
on an extraordinary Occasion—They obey'd
her Summons, and were there by the time her
Coach was got ready, which they all went into,
accompany'd on each side by Madamoiselle Douxmourie's
Man, two of Valier's, and one of
her own, all on Horseback—As they went
along, she told them on what Account she had
entreated the favour of their Company; and they
both took the liberty of assuring her, that had
they been of her Counsel beforehand, they should
have persuaded her against it; because in such Cases,
Extremes are often fatal to the Peace of both,
and that it was better sometimes to appear blind,
than too quick-sighted: But Jeal ousy is not of a Nature
to endure Controul; she was resolv'd to have
the pleasure of upbraiding, and bid the Coachman
drive as fast as possible. They got to the Inn about
three in the Morning, when all the Family
were drown'd in Sleep, except Madamoiselle
Douxmourie and those that sat up to attend
her, and open the Door to those Friends she told
them she had sent for. 
Her Servant, who had the Conduct of the
whole Affair, brought them up into his Lady's
Chamber, where Madam de l' Amye was not a 

little surpriz'd to find to whom it was she ow'd
the Discovery she was about to make; and possibly,
in spite of her own jealous Rage, wou'd rather
have seem'd to have disbeliev'd all she heard,
than gratify the Malice of this Woman, who she
knew had the greatest Hatred imaginable to her
Husband. Douxmourie, perhaps, guessing at
her Sentiments, as soon as she had put every body
out of the Room belonging to the House; Madam,
said she, I forbore to let you know I was
the Person who, by the greatest Chance in the
World, have this Opportunity of convincing you
of the Perfidy of your Husband; because the open
Enmity I have always profess'd for him, might
have made you suspect there was more of Spleen
than Justice in what I had told you: but as you
are now in the same House, and on the same
Floor with him, and the Person he prefers to you,
I doubt not but before you leave it, you will satisfy
yourself what 'tis he merits from you— 
All, and more, cry'd she, than my Resentment can
inflict; and if it be as your Messenger inform'd
me, by all that's sacred I'll—She was going to
make some rash Protestation, when Monsieur de
Valier stopp'd her Mouth; Hold, Madam! interrupted
he, I must not suffer you to give way to
Passion, till you are ascertain'd you have cause
for it—Anger sometimes blinds the Reason;
and as this Lady avows her Hate to Monsieur de
l' Amye, 'tis not impossible but that she may have
been mistaken, and has been led to credit something
more than the Truth of him she is willing
should be found guilty. This hinder'd the enrag'd
Wife from saying any more, till Madamoiselle
Douxmourie recounting the manner by which
she had made the Discovery, which she illustrated
with abundance of aggravating Circumstances,
made her relapse into her former Fury—She
was then for breaking open the Door upon them; 

tearing them to pieces; exposing them to the
whole World, seem'd too little to satisfy the
Wrong—She vented the Passion she was in
with so much Vehemence, that she who had rais'd
it, endeavour'd to abate it—Madam, said she,
'tis not impossible, but in such a House as this,
there may be Back-ways; which, if there be, this
shameful Pair are, doubtless, but too well acquainted
with them: and should your Voice discover you
are here, or any Force be used to get Entrance,
before that can be done, they may perhaps escape,
and disappoint our Aim—I, therefore, wou'd
advise you to be patient till the Morning, which
now is near at hand; and when either of them
opens the Door, which one of my Servants shall
diligently guard, we will all be ready to rush in
upon them—This Method of proceeding
receiv'd a general Approbation; and Madam
de l' Amye did all she cou'd to suppress the Violence
of her Indignation at present, that it might
fall more heavy on the Persons who had caus'd it; 
for she resolv'd in her own Mind never to forgive,
or live with her Husband more. 
The Lovers who had pass'd their Time in as
great, tho' different Anxieties, having at last fix'd
on a Place to go to, thought it most proper to
leave that they were in before Day-break; and
accordingly Monsieur de l' Amye rose, and opening
the Door to call the Hostler to get his Horse ready,
was surpriz'd to find himself, as he was stepping
back into the Chamber, push'd violently
in by a rush of People who follow'd him: The
Candles they had in their Hands, immediately inform'd
him who they were. As confus'd as he
was, he had Presence enough of Mind to run towards
the Bed, where he thought to defend his
dear Lasselia from their View, or die to expiate
the Disgrace she must suffer for his sake; 
but that unfortunate Lady, hearing a Noise, had 

rais'd herself in her Bed to see what 'twas, which
when she did, Surprize, and Shame, and Fear,
took away her Senses so far, as to deprive her
of any Thought in what manner she shou'd conceal
herself; and sat still, stupid and motionless,
expos'd to every body in the Room—'Tis hard
to say whether the Fury of Madam de l' Amye,
or the Wonder that she and all her Companions
were in, was greatest, when they found it was
Lasselia with whom he had transgress'd— 
nor cou'd either of them. surpass that which
de l' Amye felt, to see Douxmourie with them:
He no longer doubted by whom he had been betray'd,
and not answering the Invectives which
his Wife pour'd out upon him, he utter'd as many
against that She-Devil, for that was the only Name
he vouchsafed to call her by. While all were in
this Confusion, Madamoiselle de Valier, having
a little recover'd that Confusion the sight of Lasselia
had occasion'd, having a tender Friendship
for her, went towards the Bed with a design
to have spoke to her, when the undone Fair, just
then waking, as it were, from that Absence of
Mind she had been in, into a Sense of the Shame
to which she was expos'd, starting suddenly from
the Posture she had been in, and catching Monsieur
de l' Amye's Sword, which lay on a Table by the
bed-side, was about to end her Life, and the Infamy
that attended it: it was the good fortune of
that sincere Friend to prevent this Act of Desperation
from being accomplish'd; but the Attempt
put the whole Company in so great a Consternation,
as was of excellent Service to the silencing
their Clamours. De l' Amye, tho' he was ready
to fly into his Charmer's Arms, and chase away
her Despair by a thousand soft Endearments, yet
he ow'd too much to his Wife, to give her so provoking
an Instance before her Face, that she was
but the second in his Esteem—but the Pain he 

endured in this Restraint, took from him all Inclination
to continue his Reproaches to Madamoiselle
Douxmourie; and he stood speechless,
and seem'd lost in Thought, as did his Wife; 
who, tho' extremely fiery and passionate, had a
great deal of Good-Nature, and so manifest a
Proof of her Rival's Penitence and Despair,
wrought on her so far, as to engage her Pity— 
and she thought, if that wou'd make her easy, she
cou'd forgive the Wrong she had done her, provided
she wou'd never more repeat it. Monsieur
de Valier, who had watch'd the Abatement of
her Rage, perceiving her Looks were very much
softened, begg'd her to withdraw with him a Moment
into another Room; to which she having
consented, he laid so many Arguments before her,
how infinitely better it would be to hush up this
Affair, than to make herself and Husband, as well
as the Person who had injur'd her, the Chat of
the whole Country; that she at last consented, on
condition she wou'd immediately retire into a
Monastery, thereby to put it out even of her own
power to wrong her more—Having obtain'd
thus much from her, he endeavour'd to bring
de l'Amye to consent; and was labouring a long
time before he cou'd prevail on him but to promise
an eternal Separation: but the Remonstrance
the other made him, how he was indebted to his
Wife for almost every thing he was possess'd of; 
her Love, her Faithfulness to him, her Goodnature,
her condescending Temper, making an
Allowance for that one Foible, Jealousy, won so
far on his Gratitude, join'd to the Reflection how
impossible it wou'd be for him to keep the possession
of Lasselia; believing, not without
Reason, that if the Discovery of what had haphappen'd,
shou'd reach the Ear of Madam de Montespan,
as in all probability it wou'd, she wou'd
take effectual Measures to prevent his coming near 

her: all this put together, oblig'd him to an unwilling
yielding to what was propos'd. While
Monsieur de Valier was thus employ'd with the
Wife and Husband, his Lady, who had taken the
Hint privately from him, was no less busy with
Lasselia; she had a double Task to reconcile
that distress'd Lady at once to the Thoughts of
Life, and quitting the Conversation of her beloved
de l'Amye; but the Power her experienc'd
Friendship had given her over her, enforcing the
strong Reasons she made use of, in a little time
work'd their desired Effect; and this Affair ended
vastly different from what the beginning promis'd. 
The malicious Douxmourie was the only
Person vex'd at it—as for de l'Amye, tho' he
never ceas'd to think of Lasselia with a Tenderness
which cou'd not but be attended with some
melancholy Reflections; yet the Temper of his
Wife, who, after this, took double Care to make
herself agreeable to him, by degrees made him
grow more chearful. Lasselia, who, as she
had promis'd, went directly to a Convent,
strengthen'd by the good Advice of Madamoiselle
de Valier, who frequently visited her; and the
religious Conversation of the holy Maids she was
among, in time was wean'd from those sensual
Delights she had before too much indulg'd herself
in, and became an Example of Piety even to those
who never had swerv'd from it.
