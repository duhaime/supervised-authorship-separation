Some account of his fellow-travellers. 
Those who had taken places for the
coach, understanding the sixth seat was 

engaged by a foreigner, determined to profit by
his ignorance; and with that politeness which
is peculiar to this happy island, fixed themselves
in the vehicle, in such a manner, before he
had the least intimation of their design, that
he found it barely practicable to insinuate himself
sidelong between a corpulent quaker, and a
fat Wapping-landlady, in which attitude he
stuck fast, like a thin quarto between two voluminous
dictionaries on a bookseller's shelf:
and as if the pain and inconvenience of such
compression, was not sufficient matter of chagrin,
the greatest part of the company entertained
themselves with laughing at his ludicrous
station. 
The jolly dame at his left-hand, observed
with a loud exclamation of mirth, that Monsieur
would be soon better acquainted with a buttock
of English beef; and said by that time
they should arrive at their dining place, he
might be spitted without larding, “Yes, verily,” 
replied Obadiah, who was a wag in his
way, “but the swine's fat will be all on one
side.” “So much the better for you,” cried
mine hostess, “for that side is all your own.” 
The quaker was not so much disconcerted by
the quickness of this repartee, but that he answered
with great deliberation, “I thank thee
for thy love, but will not profit by thy loss; especially
as I like not the favour of these outlandish
fowls; they are profane birds of passage,
relished only by the children of vanity,
like thee.” 
The plump gentlewoman took umbrage at
this last expression, which she considered as a
double reproach, and repeated the words 

“Children of vanity!” with an emphasis of resentment. 
“I believe, if the truth were
known, said she, there's more vanity than midriff,
in that great belly of your's, for all your
pretending to humility and religion. Sirrah!
my corporation is made up of good, wholesome
English fat; but you are puffed up with the
wind of vanity and delusion; and when it begins
to gripe your entrails, you pretend to have
a motion, and then get up and preach nonsense:
yet, you'll take it upon you to call your
betters Children; marry come up, Mr Goosecap,
I have got children that are as good men
as you, or any hypocritical trembler in England.” 
A person who sat opposite to the quaker
hearing this remonstrance, which seemed pregnant
with contention, interposed in the conversation
with a conscious leer, and begged there
might be no rupture between the spirit and the
flesh. By this remonstrance, he relieved Obadiah
from the satire of this female orator, and
brought the whole vengeance of her elocution
upon his own head. “Flesh: cried she, with
all the ferocity of an enraged Thalestris, none
of your names, Mr Yellow chaps. What! I
warrant you have an antipathy to flesh, because
you yourself are nothing but skin and
bone. I suppose you are some poor starv'd
journeyman taylor come from France, where
you have been learning to cabbage, and have
not seen a good meal of victuals these seven
years; you have been living upon rye-bread
and soup maigre, and now you come over like
a walking atomy, with a rat's tail at your wig,
and a tinsey jacket; and so forsooth, you set 

up for a gentleman, and pretend to find fault
with a surloin of roast beef.” 
The gentleman heard this address with admirable
patience, and when she had rung out
her alarm, very cooly replied, “Any thing
but your stinking fish, Madam. Since when,
I pray, have you travelled in stage coaches,
and left off your old profession of crying oysters
in winter, and rotten mackarel in June? You
was then known by the name of Kate Brawn,
and in good repute among the ale-houses in
Thames street, till that unlucky amour with
the master of a corn vessel, in which he was
unfortunately detected by his own spouse; but
you seem to have risen by that fall; and I wish
you joy of your present plight: though considering
your education on Bear key, you can
give but a sorry account of yourself.” 
The amazon, though neither exhausted nor
dismayed, was really confounded at the temper
and assurance of this antagonist, who had
gathered all these anecdotes from the fertility
of his own invention; after a short pause,
however, she poured forth a torrent of obloquy
sufficient to overwhelm any person who
had not been used to take up arms against such
seas of trouble; and a dispute ensued, which
would have not only disgraced the best orators
on the Thames, but even have made a figure
in the celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries
during which the Athenian matrons rallied
one another from different waggons, with that
freedom of altercation so happily preserved in
this our age and country. 
Such a redundancy of epithets and variety
of metaphors, tropes and figures were uttered 

between these well matched opponents, that an
epic bard would have found his account in
listening to the contest, which, in all probability,
would not have been confined to words; 
had it not been interrupted for the sake of a
young woman of an agreeable countenance and
modest carriage; who being shocked at some
of their flowers of speech, and terrified by the
menacing looks and gestures of the fiery featured
dame, began to scream aloud, and beg leave
to quit the coach. Her perturbration put an
end to the high debate. The sixth passenger,
who had not opened his mouth, endeavoured
to comfort her with assurances of protection; 
the quaker proposed a cessation of arms; the
male disputant acquiesced in the proposal, assuring
the company he had entered the lists for
their entertainment only, without acquiring
the least grudge or ill will to the fat gentlewoman,
whom he protested he had never seen before
that day, and who, for aught he knew,
was a person of credit and reputation. He
then held forth his hand in token of amity,
and asked pardon of the offended party, who
was appeased by his submission; and in testimony
of her benevolence, presented to the other
female, whom she had discomposed, an
Hungary-water bottle filled with cherry brandy,
recommending it as a much more powerful remedy,
than the Sal volatile, which the other
held to her nose. 
Peace being thus re-established, in a treaty,
comprehending Obadiah and all present, it will
not be improper to give the reader some
further information touching the several
characters assembled in this vehicle. The quaker 

was a London merchant, who had been at
Deal, superintending the repairs of a ship,
which had suffered by a storm in the Downs. 
The Wapping landlady was on her return from
the same place, where she had attended the
payment of a man of war, with sundry powers
of attorney granted by the sailors, who had
lived upon credit at her house. Her competitor
in fame was a dealer in wine, a smuggler of
French lace, and a petty gamester just arrived
from Paris, in the company of an English barber
who sat on his right hand, and the young
woman was daughter of a country curate, in
her way to London, where she was bound apprentice
to a milliner. 
Hitherto Fathom had sat in silent astonishment
at the manners of his fellow travellers,
which far exceeded the notions he had pre-conceived
of English plainness and rusticity: he
found himself a monument of that disregard
and contempt, which a stranger never fails to
meet with from the inhabitants of this island; 
and saw with surprize, an agreeable young
creature sit as solitary and unheeded as himself. 
He was, indeed, allured by the roses of
her complexion, and the innocence of her aspect,
and began to repent of having pretended
ignorance of the language, by which he was restrained
from exercising his eloquence upon her
heart; he resolved, however, to ingratiate himself,
if possible, by the courtesy and politeness
of dumb shew, and for that purpose, put his
eyes in motion without farther delay.
