Our adventurer becomes absolute in his power
over the passions of his friend; and effects one
half of his aim. 
Influenced by this dire mistake, the breasts
of those unhappy lovers began to be invaded
with the horrors of jealousy: the tender-hearted
Monimia endeavoured to devour her
griefs in silence; she in secret bemoaned her
forlon fate, without ceasing; her tears flowed
without intermission from night to morn, and
from morn to night: She sought not to know
the object for which she was forsaken; she
meant not to upbraid her undoer; her aim was
to find a sequestered corner, in which she could
indulge her sorrow, where she could brood
over the melancholy remembrance of her
former felicity, where she could recollect those
happy scenes she had enjoyed under the wings
of her indulgent parents, when her whole life
was a revolution of pleasures, and she was surrounded
with affluence, pomp and admiration; 
where she could, unmolested, dwell upon the
wretched comparison between her past and
present condition, and paint every circumstance
of her misery in the most aggravating colours,
that they might make the deeper impression
upon her mind, and the more speedily contribute
to that dissolution for which she ardently 

wished, as a total release from woe. Amidst
these pinings, she began to loath all
sustenance; her cheeks grew wan, her bright
eyes lost their splendor, the roses vanished from
her lips, and her delicate limbs could hardly
support their burthen; in a word, her sole
consolation was limited to the prospect of depositing
her sorrows in the grave; and her only
wish was to procure a retreat in which she
might wait with resignation for that happy period. 
Yet this melancholly comfort she could
not obtain without the advice and mediation of
Fathom, whom she therefore still continued to
see and consult. While these consultations
were held, Renaldo's bosom was ravaged with
tempests of rage and distraction. He believed
himself superseded in the affection of his mistress,
by some favoured rival, whose success
rankled his soul; and tho' he scarce durst
communicate the suspicion to his own heart, his
observation continually whispered to him,
that he was supplanted by his friend Fathom; 
for Monimia was totally detached from the
conversation of every other man, and he had of
late noted their intercourse with distempered
eyes. 
These considerations sometimes transported
him to such a degree of frenzy, that he was
tempted to sacrifice them both as traitors to
gratitude, friendship, and love; but such deliriums
soon vanished before his honour and
humanity. He would not allow himself to
think amiss of Ferdinand, until some undoubted
mark of his guilt should appear; and this was
so far from being the case, that hitherto there 

was scarce a presumption. On the contrary
(said he to himself) I am hourly receiving
proofs of his sympathy and attachment: Not
but that he may be the innocent cause of my
mishap. His superior qualifications may have
attracted the eye, and engaged the heart of that
inconstant fair, without his being sensible of
the victory he has won; or, perhaps, shocked
at the conquest he hath unwillingly made, he
discourages her advances, tries to reason down
her unjustifiable passion, and in the mean time,
conceals from me the particulars, out of regard
to my happiness and quiet. 
Under cover of these favourable conjectures
our adventurer securely prosecuted his scheme
upon the unfortunate Monimia. He dedicated
himself wholly to her service and conversation,
except at those times when his company was
requested by Renaldo, who now very seldom
exacted his attendance: In his ministry about
the person of the beauteous orphan, this cunning
incendiary mingled such awful regard,
such melting compassion, as effectually screened
him from the suspicion of treachery, while he
widened the fatal breach between her and her
lover, by the most diabolical insinuations. He
represented his friend as a voluptuary, who
gratified his own appetite without the least regard
to honour or conscience: and with a
shew of infinite reluctance imparted some
anecdotes of his sensuality, which he had feigned
for the purpose; then he would exclaim in
an affected transport, “Gracious heaven! is
it possible for any man who has the least title to
perception or humanity, to injure such innocence
and perfection? for my own part, had I 

been so undeservedly happy—heaven and
earth! Forgive my transports madam, I cannot
help seeing and admiring such divine attractions. 
I cannot help resenting your wrongs; 
it is the cause of virtue I espouse; it ought to
be the cause of every honest man.” 
He had often repeated such apostrophes as
these, which she ascribed to nothing else than
sheer benevolence and virtuous indignation,
and actually began to think he had made some
impression upon her heart; not that he now
entertained the hope of an immediate triumph
over her chastity. The more he contemplated
her character, the more difficult the conquest
seemed to be; he therefore altered his plan,
and resolved to carry on his operations, under
the shelter of honourable proposals, foreseeing
that a wife of her qualifications, if properly
managed, would turn greatly to the account of
the husband; or if her virtue should prove refractory,
that he could, at any time, rid himself
of the incumbrance, by decamping without
beat of drum, after he should be cloyed with
possession. 
Elevated by these expectations, he, one day,
in the midst of a preconcerted rhapsody, importing,
that he could no longer conceal the
fire that preyed upon his heart, threw himself
on his knees before the lovely mourner, and
imprinted a kiss on her fair hand: Tho' he
did not presume to take this liberty, till after
such preparation as he thought had altogether
extinguished her regard for Melvil, and paved
the way for his own reception in room of that
discarded lover; he had so far overshot his
mark, that Monimia, instead of favouring his 

declaration, started up, and retired in silence,
her cheeks glowing with shame, and her eyes
gleaming with indignation. 
Ferdinand no sooner recovered from the confusion
produced by this unexpected repulse,
than he saw the necessity of coming to a speedy
determination, lest the offended fair one should
appeal to Renaldo, in which case they might
be mutually undeceived, to his utter shame and
confusion; he therefore resolved to depreciate
her anger, by humble supplications, and by
protesting, that whatever tortures he might
suffer by suppressing his sentiments, she should
never again be offended with a declaration of
his passion. 
Having thus appeased the gentle Monimia,
and discovered, that in spite of her resentment,
his friend still kept possession of her heart, he
determined to work an effectual seperation, so
as that the young lady being utterly deserted by
Melvil, should be left altogether in his power. 
With this christian intention he began to sadden
his visage with a double shade of pensive melancholy,
in the presence of Renaldo, to stifle a
succession of involuntary sighs, to answer from
the purpose, to be incoherent in his discourse,
and in a word, to act the part of a person wrapt
up in sorrowful cogitation. 
Count Melvil, soon as he perceived these
symptoms, very kindly enquired into the cause
of them, and was not a little alarmed to hear
the artful and evasive answers of Ferdinand,
who, without disclosing the source of his disquiet,
earnestly begg'd leave to retire into some
other corner of the world. Roused by this
intreaty, the Hungarian's jealousy awoke, and 

with violent agitation he exclaimed: “Then are
my fears too true! my dear Fathom, I comprehend
the meaning of your request. I have
for some time perceived an host of horrors approaching
from that quarter. I know your
worth and honour. I depend upon your
friendship, and conjure you by all the ties of
it, to free me at once from the most miserable
suspense, by owning you have involuntarily
captivated the heart of that unhappy
maiden.” 
To this solemn interrogation he made no
reply; but shedding a flood of tears (of which
he had always a magazine at command) he repeated
his desire of withdrawing, and took God
to witness, that what he proposed was solely for
the quiet of his honoured patron and beloved
friend. “Enough (cried the unfortunate Renaldo)
the measure of my woes is now filled
up.” So saying, he fell backwards in a swoon,
from which he was with difficulty recovered
to the sensation of the most exquisite torments. 
During this paroxysm, our adventurer nursed
him with infinite care and tenderness; he exhorted
him to summon all his fortitude to his
assistance; to remember his fore-fathers, and
exert himself in the imitation of their virtues; 
to fly from those bewitching charms which had
enslaved his better part, to retrieve his peace
of mind, by reflecting on the inconstancy
and ingratitude of woman, and amuse his
imagination in the pursuit of honour and
glory. 
After these admonitions, he abused his ears
with a forged detail of the gradual advances
made to him by Monimia, and the steps he had 

taken to discourage her addresses, and re-establish
her virtue; poisoning the mind of that
credulous youth to such a degree, that in all
probability he would have put a fatal period to
his own existence, had not Fathom found
means to allay the rage of his extasy, by the
cunning arrangement of opposite considerations. 
He set his pride against his love; he opposed
his resentment to his sorrow, and his
ambition to his despair. Notwithstanding
the ballance of power, so settled among
these antagonists, so violent were the shocks
of their successive conflicts, that his bosom
fared like a wretched province harrassed,
depopulated, and laid waste, by two fierce contending
armies. From this moment, his life
was nothing but an alternation of starts and
reveries; he wept and raved by turns, according
to the prevailing gust of passion; food
became a stranger to his lips, and sleep to his
eye-lids; he could not support the presence of
Monimia; her absence increased the torture
of his pangs; and when he met her by accident,
he started back with horror, like a traveller
who chances to tread upon a snake. 
The poor afflicted orphan, worn to a shadow
with self-consuming anguish, eager to find
some lowly retreat, where she could breathe out
her soul in peace, and terrified at the frantic
behaviour of Renaldo, communicated to Fathom
her desire of removing, and begged that
he would take a small picture of her father,
decorated with diamonds, and convert them
into money for the expence of her subsistence. 
This was the last pledge of her family, which
she had received from her mother, who had 

preserved it in the midst of numberless distresses; 
and no other species of misery, but that
which she groaned under, could have prevailed
upon the daughter to part with it: But exclusive
of other motives, the very image itself, by
recalling to her mind the honours of her
name, upbraided her with living in dependence
upon a man, who had treated her with such
indignity and ingratitude; besides, she flattered
herself with the hope that she should not long
survive the loss of this testimonial. 
Our adventurer, with many professions of
sorrow and mortification at his own want of
capacity, to prevent such an alienation, undertook
to dispose of it to the best advantage, and
to provide her with a cheap and retired apartment,
to which he would conduct her in safety,
tho' at the hazard of his life. In the mean
time, however, he repaired to his friend Renaldo; 
and after having admonished him to
arm his soul with patience and philosophy,
declared that Monimia's guilty passion for himself
could no longer be kept within bounds:
that she had conjured him, in the most pressing
manner, to assist her in escaping from an house
which she considered as the worst of dungeons,
because she was in it daily exposed to the sight
and company of a man whom she detested; 
and that she had bribed him to compliance
with her request, not only with repeated promises
of eternal love and submission, but also
with the picture of her father set with diamonds,
which she had hitherto reserved as the
last and greatest testimony of her affection and
esteem. 
With these words, he presented the fatal 

pledge to the eyes of the astonished youth,
upon whom it operated like the poisonous
sight of the basilisk; for, in an instant, the
whole passions of his soul were in the most
violent agitation. “What! (cried he, in an
extasy of rage) is she so abandoned to perfidy,
so lost to shame, so damned to constancy, to
gratitude and virtuous love, as to meditate the
means of leaving me without decency, without
remorse! to forsake me in my adversity, when
my hapless fortune can no longer flatter the
pride and vanity of her expectation! O woman!
woman! woman! what simile shall I
find to illustrate the character of the sex; but
I will not have recourse to vain complaints and
feeble exclamations. By heaven! she shall not
'scape; she shall not triumph in her levity—she
shall not exult in my distress: No! I will rather
sacrifice her to my just resentment, to the
injured powers of love and friendship. I will
act the avenging minister of heaven! I will
mangle that fair bosom which contains so false
an heart! I will tear her to pieces, and scatter
those beauteous limbs, as a prey to the beasts
of the field, and the fowls of the air!” 
Fathom, who expected this storm, far from
attempting to oppose its progress, waited with
patience until its first violence was overblown; 
then assuming an air of condolance, animated
with that resolution which a friend ought to
maintain on such occasions: “My dear count
(said he) I am not at all surprized at your emotion,
because I know what an heart, susceptible
as yours, must feel, from the apostacy of one
who has reigned so long the object of your
love, admiration, and esteem. Your endeavours

to drive her from your thoughts, must
create an agony much more severe, than that
which divorces the soul from the body. Nevertheless,
I am so confident of your virtue and
your manhood, as to foresee that you will
allow the frail Monimia to execute that resolution
which she hath so unwisely taken, to withdraw
herself from your love and protection. 
Believe me, my best friend and benefactor, this
is a step, in consequence of which you will
infallibly retrieve your peace of mind. It may
cost you many bitter pangs, it may probe your
wounds to the quick; but those pangs will be
soothed by the gentle and salutary wing of time,
and that probing will rouse you to a due sense
of your own dignity and importance, which
will enable you to convert your attention to objects
far more worthy of your contemplation. 
All the hopes of happiness you had cherished
in the possession of Monimia, are now irrecoverably
blasted; her heart is now debased beneath
your consideration: her love is, without
all doubt, extinguished, and her honour irretrievably
lost; insomuch, that were she to profess
sorrow for her indiscretion, and implore
your forgiveness, with the most solemn promises
of regarding you for the future with unalterable
fidelity and affection, you ought not to restore
her to that place in your heart which she hath
so meanly forfeited; because you could not at
the same time reinstate her in the possession of
that delicate esteem without which there is no
harmony, no rapture, no true enjoyment in
love. No, my dear Renaldo, expel the unworthy
tenant from your bosom; allow her
to fill up the measure of her ingratitude, by deserting 

her lover, friend and benefactor. Your
glory demands her dismission; the world will
applaud your generosity, and your own heart
approve of your conduct: So disincumbered,
let us exert ourselves once more in promoting
your departure from this island, that you may
revisit your father's house, do justice to yourself
and amiable sister, and take vengeance on
the author of your wrongs; then dedicate
yourself to glory, in imitation of your renowned
ancestors, and flourish in the favour of your
imperial patron.” 
These remonstrances had such effect upon
the Hungarian, that his face was lighted up
with a transient gleam of satisfaction; he embraced
Ferdinand with great ardour, calling
him his pride, his Mentor, his good genius,
and intreated him to gratify the inclination of
that fickle creature, so far as to convey her to
another lodging, without loss of time, while
he would, by absenting himself, favour their
retreat. 
Our hero having obtained this permission,
went immediately to the skirts of the town,
where he had previously bespoke a small, tho'
neat apartment, at the house of an old woman,
widow of a French refugee; he had already
reconnoitred the ground, by sounding his
landlady, from whose poverty and complaisance
he found reason to expect all sorts of freedom
and opportunity for the accomplishment of
his aim upon Monimia's person. The room
being prepared for her reception, he returned
to that disconsolate beauty, to whom he presented
ten guineas which he pretended to have
raised by pledging the picture; though he himself 

acted as the pawn broker on this occasion,
for a very plain and obvious reason. The fair
orphan was overjoyed to find her wish so speedily
accomplished: she forthwith packed up
her necessaries in a trunk; and an hackney-coach
was called in the dusk of the evening, in
which she embarked with her baggage and conductor. 
Yet she did not leave the habitation of Renaldo
without regret. In the instant of parting,
the idea of that unfortunate youth was associated
with every well known object that presented
itself to her eyes; not as an inconstant,
ungenerous and perjured swain, but as the accomplished,
the virtuous, the melting lover, who
had captivated her virgin heart. As Fathom
led her to the door, she was met by Renaldo's
dog, which had long been her favourtie, and
the poor animimal fawning upon her as she
passed, her heart was overwhelmed with such
a gush of tenderness, that a flood of tears
streamed down her cheeks, and she had well
nigh sunk upon the floor. 
Ferdinand, considering this emotion as the
last tribute she would pay to Renaldo, hurried
her into the coach, where she soon recovered
her composure; and in a little time he
ushered her into the house of madam la Mer,
by whom she was received with great cordiality,
and conducted to her apartment, with which
she found no other fault, but that of its being
too good for one in her forlorn situation; 
here while the tear of gratitude started in
either eye, she thanked our adventurer for
his benevolence and kind concern, assuring him
that she would not fail daily to beseech the 

Most High to shower down blessings upon him
as the orphan's friend and protector. 
Fathom was not deficient in those expressions
that were best adapted to her present turn
of mind; he observed, that what he had done
was in obedience to the dictates of common
humanity, which would have prompted him to
assist any fellow creature in distress; but that
her peculiar virtue and qualifications were such
as challenged the utmost exertion of his faculties
in her service; he said, that surely Heaven
had not created such perfection in vain; that
she was destined to receive as well as to
communicate happiness: and that the Providence
which she so piously adored, would not
fail, in due season, to raise her from distress
and affliction, to that honour and felicity for
which she was certainly ordained; in the mean
time he intreated her to depend upon his
service and fidelity, and the article of her board
being settled, he left her to the company and
consolation of her discreet hostess, who soon
insinuated herself into the good opinion of her
beauteous lodger. 
While our hero was employed in this transaction,
Renaldo sallied forth in a sort of intoxication,
which Fathom's admonitions had
inspired: and repairing to a certain noted coffee-house,
engaged at chess with an old French
refugee, that his attention, by being otherwise
employed, might not stray towards that
fatal object which he ardently wished to forget. 
But, unluckily for him, he had scarce performed
three moves of the game, when his ears
were exposed to a dialogue between two young
gentlemen; one of whom asked the other, if 

he would go and see the orphan acted at one
of the theatres; observing, as a farther inducement,
that the part of Monimia would be
performed by a young gentlewoman who had
never appeared on the stage. At mention
of that name Renaldo started: for, tho' it did
not properly belong to his orphan, it was the
appellation by which she had been distinguished
ever since her separation from her father's house,
and therefore it recalled her to his imagination
in the most interesting point of view. 
Though he endeavoured to expel the image,
by a closer application to his play, every now
and then it intruded upon his fancy, and at each
return made a stronger impression; so that he
found himself in the situation of an unfortunate
bark stranded upon some hidden rock,
which, when the wind begins to blow, feels
every succeeding wave more boisterous than the
former, until, with irresistible fury, they surmount
her decks, sweep every thing before
them, and dash her all to pieces. 
The refugee had observed his first emotion,
which he attributed to an unforeseen advantage
he himself had gained over the Hungarian: but
seeing him, in the sequel, bite his lip, roll his
eyes, groan, writhe his body, ejaculate incoherent
curses, and neglect his game, the Huguenot
concluded, that he was mad; and, being
seized with terror and dismay, got up and scampered
off without ceremeny or hesitation. 
Melvil, thus left to the horrors of his own
thought, which tortured him with the apprehension
of losing Monimia for ever, could no
longer combat that suggestion, but ran homewards
with all the speed he could exert, in order 

to prevent her retreat. When he crossed
the threshold, he was struck with such a damp
of presaging fear, that he durst not in person
approach her apartment, nor even, by questioning
the servant, inform himself of the particulars
he wanted to know: yet his suspence
becoming more insupportable than his fear, he
rushed from room to room in quest of that
which was not to be found: and, seeing Monimia's
chamber door open, entered the deserted
temple in a state of distraction, calling
aloud upon her name. All was silent, solitary
and woful, “She is gone—(he cried, shedding
a flood of tears) —she is for ever lost; and
all my hopes of happiness are fled!” 
So saying, he sunk upon that couch on which
Monimia had oft reposed, and abandoned himself
to all the excess of grief and despondence. 
In this deplorable condition he was found by
our adventurer, who gently chid him for his
want of resolution, and again repelled his
sorrow, by arrousing his resentment against the
innocent cause of his disquiet, having beforehand
forged the particulars of provocation. “Is
it possible,” said he, “that Renaldo can still
retain the least sentiment of regard for a fickle
woman, by whom he has been so ungratefully
forsaken and so unjustly scorned? Is it possible
he can be so disturbed by the loss of a creature,
who is herself lost to all virtue and decorum? — 
Time and reflection, my worthy friend,
will cure you of that inglorious malady: and
the future misconduct of that imprudent damsel
will, doubtless, contribute to the recovery of
your peace. Her behaviour at leaving the
house, where she had received so many marks 

of the most delicate affection, was in all respects
so opposite to honour and decency, that I could
scarce refrain from telling her I was shocked
at her deportment, even while she loaded me
with protestations of love. When a woman's
heart is once depraved, she bids adieu to all restraint;— 
she preserves no measures. It was
not simply contempt which she expressed for
Renaldo; she seems to resent his being able to
live under her disdain; and that resentment
stoops to objects unworthy of indignation. 
Even your dog was not exempted from the effects
of her displeasure: for, in her passage to
the door, she kicked the poor animal as one
of your dependants; and in our way to the
apartment I had provided for her, she entertained
me with a ludicrous comment upon the
manner in which you first made her acquainted
with your passion. All that modesty of carriage,
all that chastity of conversation, all that
dignity of grief, which she knew so well how
to affect, is now entirely laid aside, and when I
quitted her, she seemed the most gay, giddy and
impertinent of her sex.” 
“Gracious powers! (exclaimed Renaldo,
starting from the couch) am I under the delusion
of a dream; or are these things really
so, as my friend has represented them? Such
a total and sudden degeneracy is amazing! is
monstrous and unnatural!” —“Such, my
dear Count,” replied our hero, “is the caprice
of a female heart, fickle as the wind, uncertain
as a calm at sea, fixed to no principle, but
swayed by every fantastic gust of passion, or of
whim. Congratulate yourself, therefore, my
friend, upon your happy deliverance from such 

a domestic plague—upon the voluntary exile
of a traitor from your bosom;—recollect the
dictates of your duty, your discretion, and your
glory, and think upon the honours and elevated
enjoyment for which you are certainly ordained. 
To night, let us over a chearful bottle
anticipate your success; and to-morrow I will
accompany you to the house of an usurer, who
I am informed fears no risk, provided twenty
per cent. be given, and the borrower's life insured.”
