Fathom makes various efforts in the world of
gallantry. 
Thus connected they began to hunt in
couples; and Fathom, in order to profit
by the alliance, with a good grace, contrived a
small scheme that succeeded to his wish. Renaldo
being one night intoxicated in the course
of a merry-making with his fellow pupils, from
which Fathom had purposely absented himself,
was by the Tyroleze so artfully provoked to
play, that he could not resist the temptation,
but engaged at pass-dice with that fell adversary,
who, in less than an hour, stripped him of
a pretty round sum. Next day, when the
young gentleman recovered the use of his reflexion,
he was sensibly chagrin'd at the folly 

and precipitation of his own conduct, an account
of which he communicated in confidence
to our hero, with demonstrations of infinite
shame and concern. 
Ferdinand having moralized upon the subject
with great sagacity, and sharply inveighed
against the Tyroleze, for the unfair advantage
he had taken, retired to his closet and wrote
the following billet, which was immediately sent
to his alley. 

“The obligations I owe, and the attachments
I feel to the count de Melvile, will not suffer
me to be an idle spectator of the wrongs offered
to his son, in the dishonourable use,
I understand, you made last night of his unguarded
hours: I therefore insist upon your
making immediate restitution of the booty
which you so unjustly got; otherwise I expect
you will meet me upon the ramparts,
near the bastion de la Port-Neuve, to-morrow
morning at day-break, in order to justify
with your sword, the finesse you have
practised upon the friend of 
“Ferdinand de Fathom.” 
The gamester no sooner received this intimation,
than according to the plan which had
been preconcerted betwixt the author and him,
he went to the apartment of Renaldo, and presenting
the sum of money which he had defrauded
him of the preceeding night, told
him with a stern countenance, that though it
was a just acquisition, he scorned to avail himself
of his good fortune against any person who entertained
the smallest doubt of his honour. 

The young count, surprized at this address,
rejected his offer with disdain, and desired to
know the meaning of such an unexpected declaration. 
Upon which, the other produced
Ferdinand's billet, and threatned, in very high
terms, to meet the stripling according to his
invitation, and chastise him severely for his presumption. 
The consequence of this explanation
is obvious. Renaldo, imputing the officiousness
of Fathom to the zeal of his friendship,
interposed in the quarrel, which was amicably
compromised, not a little to the honour
of our adventurer, who thus obtained an opportunity
of displaying his courage and integrity,
without the least hazard to his person; 
while at the same time, his confederate recommended
himself to the esteem of the young
count, by his spirited behaviour on this occasion; 
so that Renaldo being less shy of his company
for the future, the Tyroleze had the
fairer opportunities to prosecute his designs
upon the young gentleman's purse. 
It would be almost superfluous to say that these
were not neglected. The son of count Melvile
was not deficient in point of penetration:
but, his whole study was, at that time, engrossed
by the care of his education; and he had
sometimes recourse to play, as to an amusement
by which he sought to unbend the severity
of his attention: no wonder then, that he
fell a prey to an artful gamester, who had
been regularly trained to the profession, and
made it the sole study of his life; especially as
the Hungarian was remarkable for a warmth
of temper, which a knight of the post always
knows how to manage for his own advantage. 

In the course of these operations, Fathom
was a very useful correspondent: he instructed
the Tyroleze in the peculiarities of Renaldo's
disposition, and made him acquainted with the
preper seasons for profiting by his dexterity. 
Ferdinand, for example, who by the authority
derived to him from the injunctions of the old
count, sometimes took upon himself the office
of an adviser, cunningly chose to counsel the
son, at those conjunctures, when he knew him
least able to bear such expostulation. Advice,
improperly administred, generally acts in diametrical
opposition to the purpose for which it
is supposed to be given: at least this was the
case with the young gentleman, who, inflamed
by the reproof of such a tutor, used to obey
the dictates of his resentment, in an immediate
repetition of that conduct which our adventurer
had taken the liberty to disapprove; and
the gamester was always at hand, to minister
unto his indignation. By these means he was
disencumbered of divers considerable remittances,
with which his father chearfully supplied
him, on the supposition that they were spent
with taste and liberality, under the direction
of our adventurer. 
But Ferdinand's views were not confined to
the narrow field of this alliance: he attempted
divers enterprizes in the world of gallantry,
conscious of his own personal qualifications,
and never doubting that he could insinuate
himself into the good graces of some married
lady about court, or lay an opulent dowager
under contribution. But he met with an obstacle
in his endeavours of this kind, which
all his art was unable to surmount. This was 

no other than the obscurity of his birth, and
the want of a title, without which no person in
that country lays claim to the privileges of a gentleman. 
Had he foreseen this inconvenience,
he might have made shift to obviate the consequences,
by obtaining permission to appear
in the character of the count's kinsman: tho',
in all probability, such an expedient would not
have been extremely agreeable to the old gentleman,
who was very tenacious of the honour
of his family: nevertheless, his generosity
might have been prevailed upon, to indulge
Fathom with such a pretext, in consideration
of the youth's supposed attachment, and the
obligations for which he deemed himself indebted
to his deceased mother. 
True it is, Ferdinand, upon his first arrival
at Vienna, had been admitted into fashionable
company, on the footing of Renaldo's companion,
because no body suspected the defect of
his pedigree; and even after a report had been
circulated to the prejudice of his extraction, by
the industry of a lacquey who attended the
young count, there were not wanting many
young people of distinction, who still favoured
him with their countenance and correspondence:
but he was no longer invited to private
families, in which only he could expect
to profit by his address among the ladies, and
had the mortification of finding himself frequently
excepted from parties which were expressly
calculated for the entertainment of the
young count. Luckily, his spirit was so pliant
as to sustain these slights, without being much
dejected: instead of repining at the loss of that
respect which had been paid to him at first, he 

endeavoured with all his might, to preserve the
little that still remained, and resolved to translate
into an humbler sphere, that gallantry
which he had no longer opportunities of displaying
in the world of rank and fashion.
