The continuation and conclusion of Mr. Melopoyn's
story. 
I made shift, notwithstanding, to maintain myself
till the beginning of next winter, when
I renewed my addresses to my friend Mr. Supple,
and was most graciously received. —“I have been
thinking of your affair Mr. Melopoyn, (said
he) and am determined to shew how far I
have your interest at heart, by introducing
you to a young nobleman of my acquaintance,
who is remarkable for his fine taste in dramatic
writings, and is, beside, a man of such influence,
that if once he should approve your play,
his patronage will support it against all the
efforts of envy and ignorance: For I do
assure you, that merit alone will not bring success. 
—I have already spoken of your performance
to Lord Rattle, and if you will call at
my house, in a day or two, you shall have a
letter of introduction to his lordship.” —I was
ensibly touched with this mark of Mr. Supple's 

friendship, and looking upon my affair as already
done, went home and imparted my good fortune
to my landlord, who, to render my appearance
more acceptable to my patron, procured a suit of
new cloaths for me on his own credit. 
Not to trouble you with idle particulars, I
carried my tragedy to his lordship's lodgings, and
sent it up along with Mr. Supple's letter, by one
of his servants, who desired me, by his lord's
order, to return in a week. —I did so, and was
admitted to his lordship, who received me very
courteously, told me he had perused my play,
which he thought, on the whole, was the best
coup d'essai he had ever seen; but that he had
marked some places in the margin, which he imagined
might be altered for the better. —I was
transported with this reception, and promised
(with many acknowledgments of his lordship's
generosity) to be governed solely by his advice
and direction. —“Well then (said he) write
another fair copy with the alterations I have
proposed, and bring it to me as soon as possible,
for I am resolved to have it brought on
the stage this winter.” —You may be sure I
set about this task with alacrity, and although I
found his lordship's remarks much more numerous,
and of less importance than I expected, I
thought it was not my interest to dispute upon
trifles with my patron; therefore new-modelled
it according to his desire, in less than a month. 
When I waited upon him with the manuscript,
I found one of the actors at breakfast with his
lordship, who immediately introduced him to my
acquaintance, and desired him to read a scene of
my play. —This he performed very much to
my satisfaction, with regard to emphasis and pronounciation; 

but he signified his disgust at several
words in every page, which I presuming to
defend, Lord Rattle told me, with a peremptory
look, I must not pretend to dispute with him,
who had been a player these twenty years, and
understood the œconomy of the stage better than
any man living. I was forced to submit, and
his lordship proposed the same actor should read
the whole play, in the evening, before some gentlemen
of his acquaintance, whom he would convene
at his lodgings for that purpose. 
I was present at the reading; and I protest to
you, my dear friend, I never underwent such a
severe trial in the whole course of my life, as at
that juncture! for although the player might be
a very honest man and a good performer, he
was excessively illiterate and assuming, and made
a thousand frivolous objections, which I was not
permitted to answer: However, the piece was
very much applauded on the whole; the gentlemen
present, who I understood were men of
fortune, promised to countenance and support it as
much as they could; and Lord Rattle assuring me,
that he would act the part of a careful nurse to
it, desired me to carry it home and alter it immediately
according to their remarks: —I
was fain to acquiesce in his determination, and
fulfilled his injunctions with all the expedition in
my power; but before I could present the new
copy, my good friend Mr. Supple had disposed
of his property and patent to one Mr. Brayer; so
that fresh interest was to be made with the new
manager. —This task Lord Rattle undertook,
having some acquaintance with him, and recommended
my performance so strongly, that it was
received. 

I looked upon myself now, as upon the eve
of reaping the fruits of all my labour: I waited
a few days in expectation of its being put into
rehearsal, and wondering at the delay, applied to
my worthy patron, who excused Mr. Brayer
on account of the multiplicity of business in
which he was involved; and bid me beware of
teizing the patentee. —I treasured up this caution,
and exerted my patience three weeks longer; at
the end of which, his lordship gave me to understand
that Mr. Brayer had read my play, and
owned it had undubitable merit; but as he had
long been pre-engaged to another author, he
could not possibly represent it that season; though
if I would reserve it for the next and in the
interim make such alterations as he had proposed
by observations on the margin, I might depend
upon his compliance. 
Thunderstruck at this disappointment, I could
not, for some minutes, utter one syllable: At
length, however, I complained bitterly of the
manager's insincerity in amusing me so long, when
he knew from the beginning, that he could not
gratify my desire. —But his lordship reprimanded
me for my freedom, said Mr. Brayer was a man
of honour, and imputed his behaviour with respect
to me, to nothing else but forgetfulness. — 
And indeed I have had some reason since that
time, to be convinced of his bad memory; for, in
spite of appearances, I will not allow myself to interpret
his conduct any other way. —Lord Rattle
observing me very much affected with my disappointment,
offered his interest to bring on my
play at the other house, which I eagerly accepting,
he forthwith wrote a letter of recommendation
to Mr. Bellower, actor, and prime minister 

to Mr. Vandal, proprietor of that theatre; and
desired me to deliver it with my tragedy, without
loss of time. —Accordingly, I hastened to his
house, where after having waited a whole hour
in a lobby, I was admitted to his presence, and
my performance received with great state. —He
told me he was extremely busy at present, but
he would peruse it as soon as possible; and bid
me call again in a week. I took my leave, not a
little astonished at the port and supercilious behaviour
of this stage-player, who had not treated me
with good manners; and began to think the dignity
of a poet greatly impaired since the days of
Euripedes and Sophocles; but all this was nothing
in comparison of what I have since observed. 
Well, Mr. Random, I went back at the appointed
time, and was told that Mr. Bellower
was engaged, and could not see me. —I repeated
my visit a few days after, and having waited a
considerable time, was favoured with an audience,
during which, he said, he had not as yet read
my play. —Nettled at this usage, I could contain
myself no longer, but telling him, I
imagined he would have paid more deference to
Lord Rattle's recommendation, demanded my
manuscript with some expressions of resentment. 
—“Ay, (said he, in a theatrical tone)
with all my heart.” —Then pulling out a drawer
of the bureau at which he sat, he took out a
bundle, and threw it upon a table that was near
him, pronouncing the word “There,” with
great disdain. —I took it up, and perceiving with
some surprize, that it was a comedy, told him,
it did not belong to me; upon which he offered
me another, which I also disclaimed—A third
was produced, and rejected for the same reason. At 

length, he pulled out a whole handful, and spread
them before me, saying, “There are seven— 
take which you please—or take them all.” — 
I singled out my own, and went away, struck
dumb with admiration at what I had seen—not
so much on account of his insolence, as of
the number of new plays, which from this circumstance,
I concluded were yearly offered to
the stage. —You may be sure I did not fail to
carry my complaint to my patron, who did not
receive it with all the indignation I expected; 
but taxed me with precipitation, and told me, I
must lay my account with bearing the humours
of the players, if I intended to write for the
stage. —“There is now no other remedy (said
he) but to keep it till the next season for Mr.
Brayer, and alter it at your leisure, in the summer,
according to his directions.” —I was now
reduced to a terrible alternative, either to quit
all hopes of my tragedy, from which I had all
along promised myself a large share of fortune and
reputation, or to encounter eight long months of
adversity in preparing for, and expecting its appearance. 
—This last pennance, painful as it was,
seemed most eligible to my reflection at that time,
and therefore I resolved to undergo it. 
Why should I tire you with particulars of no
consequence? I wrestled with extreme poverty,
until the time of my probation was expired; 
and went to my Lord Rattle in order to remind
him of my affair, when I understood, to my great
concern, that his lordship was on the point of
going abroad, and, which was still more unfortunate
for me, Mr. Brayer had gone into the
country; so that my generous patron had it not
in his power to introduce me personally, as he 

intended: However, he wrote a very strong letter
to the manager in my favour, and put him in
mind of the promise he had made in behalf of
my play. 
As soon as I was certified of Brayer's return, I
went to his house with this letter, but was told
he was gone out. —I called again next day early
in the morning, received the same answer,
and was desired to leave my name and business; 
I did so, and returned the day after, when the
servant still affirmed that his master was gone
abroad; though I perceived him, as I retired,
observing me through a window. —Incensed
at this discovery, I went to a coffee-house
hard by, and inclosing his lordship's letter in one
from myself, demanding a categorical answer, I
sent it to his house by a porter, who returned in
a few minutes, and told me Mr. Brayer would
be glad to see me at that instant. —I obeyed the
summons, and was received with such profusion
of compliments and apologies, that my resentment
immediately subsided, and I was even in
pain for the concern which this honest man shewed
at the mistake of his servant, who, it seems, had
been ordered to deny him to every body but me. 
—He expressed the utmost veneration for his good
and noble friend Lord Rattle, whom he should
always be proud to serve; promised to peruse the
play with all dispatch, and give me a meeting
upon it; and as a testimony of his esteem, made
me a present of a general order for the season,
by which I would be admitted to any part of
the theatre. —This was a very agreeable compliment
to me, whose greatest pleasure consisted in
seeing dramatic performances, and you need not
doubt that I often availed myself of my privilege. 

As I had an opportunity of being behind the scenes
when I pleased, I frequently conversed with Mr.
Brayer about my play, and asked when he intended
to put it into rehearsal, but he had always so much
business upon his hands, that it remained with
him unopened a considerable while; and I became
very uneasy about the season, that wasted apace,
when I saw in the papers, another new play advertised,
which had been written, offered, accepted
and rehearsed in the compass of three months,
without my knowledge or suspicion. —You may
easily guess how much I was confounded at this
event! I own to you, that in the first transports of
my anger, I suspected Mr. Brayer of having acted
towards me in the most pitiful, perfidious manner; 
and was actually glad at his disappointment
in the success of his favourite piece, which by
the strength of art, lingered till the third night,
and then died in a deplorable manner. But now
that passion has no share in my reflection, I am
willing to ascribe his behaviour to his want of memory
or want of judgment, which, you know,
are natural defects, that are more worthy of compassion
than reproach. 
About this time, I happened to be in company
with a gentlewoman, who having heard of my
tragedy, told me, she was acquainted with the
wife of a gentleman, who was very well known
to a lady, who had great interest with a person
who was intimate with Earl Sheerwit, and that if
I pleased, she would use her influence in my behalf. 
—As this nobleman had the character of a
Mæcenas in the nation, and could stamp a value
upon any work by his sole countenance and approbation,
I accepted her offer with eagerness,
in full confidence of seeing my reputation established, 

and my wishes fulfilled in a very short
time, provided that I should have the good fortune
to please his Lordship's taste. I withdrew
the manuscript from the hands of Mr. Brayer, and
committed it to the care of this gentlewoman,
who laboured so effectually in my interest, that
in less than a month it was conveyed to the Earl,
and in a few weeks after, I had the satisfaction
to hear, that he had read, and approved it very
much. Transported with this piece of intelligence,
I flattered myself with the hopes of his interesting
himself in its favour; but hearing no more of the
matter in three whole months, I began (God
forgive me) to suspect the veracity of the person
who brought me the good tidings, for I thought
it impossible, that a man of his rank and character,
who knew the difficulty of writing a good tragedy,
and understood the dignity of the work,
should read and applaud an essay of this kind,
without feeling an inclination to befriend the
author, whom his countenance alone could
raise above dependance. —But it was not long
before I found my friends very much wronged by
my opinion. 
You most know, that the civilities I had received
from Lord Rattle, and the desire he manifested
to promote the success of my play, encouraged
me to write an account of my bad fortune
to his Lordship, who condescended so far
as to desire, by letter, a young Squire of a great
estate, with whom he was intimate, to espouse
my cause, and in particular, make me acquainted
with one Mr. Marmozet a celebrated player, who
had lately appeared on the stage with astonishing
eclat, and bore such sway in the house where he
acted, that the managers durst not refuse any 

thing he recommended. The young gentleman
whom Lord Rattle had employed for this purpose,
being diffident of his own interest with Mr. Marmozet,
had recourse to a nobleman of his acquaintance,
who, at his sollicitation, was so good
as to introduce me to him; and the conversation
turning upon my performance, I was not a little
surprized, as well as pleased to hear, that Earl
Sheerwit had spoke very much in its praise, and
even sent Mr. Marmozet the copy, with a message
expressing a desire that he would act in it next season
—Nor was this favourite actor backward in
commending the piece, which he mentioned with
some expressions of regard, that I do not chuse
to repeat; assuring me that he would appear
in it, provided he should be engaged to play at all
during the ensuing season. In the mean time,
he desired I would give him leave to peruse it in
the country, whither he intended to remove
next day, that he might have leisure to consider
and point out such alterations as might, perhaps,
be necessary for the jeu de theatre; and took my
direction, that he might communicate by letter,
the observations he should make. Trusting to
these assurances and the interest which had been
made in my behalf, I hugged myself in the expectation
of seeing it, not only acted, but acted
to the greatest advantage, which I thought could
not fail of recompensing me in an ample manner,
for the anxiety and affliction I had undergone: 
But six weeks being elapsed, I did not know how
to reconcile Mr. Marmozet's silence, with his
promise of writing to me in ten days after he set
out for the country; however, I was at last favoured
with a letter, importing that he had made
some remarks on my tragedy, which he would 

freely impart at meeting, and advising me to put it,
without loss of time, into the hands of that manager,
who had the best company: for he himself
was quite uncertain, whether or not he
should be engaged that winter. —I was a good
deal alarmed at this last part of his letter, and
advised about it with a friend, who told me, it
was a plain indication of Mr. Marmozet's desire
to be rid of his promise: that his pretended uncertainty
about acting next winter, was no other
than a scandalous evasion; for to his certain knowledge,
he was already engaged, or at least, in
terms with Mr. Vandal; and that his design was
to disappoint me, in favour of a new comedy,
which he had purchased of the author, and intended
to bring upon the stage for his own advantage. 
—In short, my dear Sir, this person,
who, I must own, is of a very sanguine complexion,
handled the moral character of Mr. Marmozet with
such severity, that I began to suspect him of some
particular prejudice, and put myself upon my
guard against his insinuations. —I ought to crave
pardon for this tedious narration of trivial circumstances,
which, however interesting they may be
to me, must certainly be very dry and insipid to
the ear of one unconcerned in the affair. —But
I understand the meaning of your looks, and will
proceed. —Well, Sir, Mr. Marmozet, upon
his return to town, treated me with uncommon
complaisance, and invited me to his lodgings,
where he proposed to communicate his remarks,
which I confess were more unfavourable than I
expected; but I answered his objections, and, as
I thought, brought him over to my opinion; for,
on the whole, he signified the highest approbation
of the performance. —In the course of our dispute, 

I was not a little surprized to find this poor
gentleman's memory so treacherous as to let him
forget what he had said to me, before he went
out of town, in regard to Earl Sheerwit's opinion
of my play, which he now professed himself ignorant
of; and I was extremely mortified at
hearing from his own mouth, that his interest
with Mr. Vandal was so very low, as to be insufficient
of itself, to bring a new piece upon the
stage. I then begged his advice, and he counselled
me to apply to Earl Sheerwit for a message in my
favour to the manager, who would not presume
to refuse any thing recommended by so great a
man; and he was so kind as to promise to second
this message with all his power. —I had immediate
recourse to the worthy gentlewoman my
friend already mentioned, who opened the channels
of her conveyance with such expedition, that
in few days, I had a promise of the message, provided
I could assure myself of Mr. Vandal's being
uningaged to any other; for his Lordship did
not chuse to condescend so far, until he should
understand that there was a probability (at least)
of succeeding; at the same time in which I was
blessed with this piece of news, I was startled at
another, by the same canal of communication; 
which was, that Mr. Marmozet, before he advised
me to this application, had informed the
Earl, that he had read my play, and found it
altogether unfit for the stage. —Though I could
not doubt the certainty of this intelligence, I believed
there was some misapprehension in the case; 
and without taking any notice of it, told Mr.
Marmozet the answer I had been favoured with; 
upon which, he testified much joy, and promised
to ask Mr. Vandal the question proposed. —I 

waited upon him in a day or two, when he gave
me to understand, that Mr. Vandal having professed
himself free of all engagements, he had put
my play into his hands, and represented it as a
piece strongly recommended by Earl Sheerwit,
who (he assured him) would honour him with a
message in its favour; and he desired me to call
for an answer at Mr. Vandal's house, in three
days. —I followed his directions, and found the
manager, who, being made acquainted with my
business, owned, that Mr. Marmozet had given
him a manuscript play, but denied that he had
mentioned Earl Sheerwit's name. —When I informed
him of the circumstances of the affair,
he said, he had no engagement with any author; 
that he would read my tragedy forthwith; and did
not believe he should venture to reject it in contradiction
to his Lordship's opinion, for which he
had the utmost veneration, but put it into rehearsal
without loss of time. —I was so much
intoxicated with this encouragement, that I overlooked
the mysterious conduct of Mr. Marmozet,
and attended the manager at the time appointed,
when, to my infinite confusion! he pronounced
my play improper for the stage, and rejected it
accordingly. As soon as I could recollect myself
from the disorder into which this unexpected refusal
had thrown me, I expressed a desire of
hearing his objections, which were so groundless,
indistinct and unintelligible, that I persuaded myself
he had not at all perused the piece, but had been
prompted by somebody whose lessons he had not
rightly retained. However, I have been since
informed, that the poor man's head, which was not
naturally very clear, had been disordered with superstition,
and that he laboured under the tyranny 

of a wife, and the terrors of hell fire at the same
time. —Precipitated in this manner, from the
highest pinnacle of hope, to the abyss of despondence,
I was ready to sink under the burthen of
my affliction; and in the bitterness of my anguish,
could not help entertaining some doubts of Mr.
Marmozet's integrity, when I recollected and
compared the circumstances of his conduct towards
me. I was encouraged in this suspicion, by
being told, that my Lord Sheerwit had spoke of
his character with great contempt; and in particular,
resented his insolence in opposing his own
taste to that of his Lordship, concerning my tragedy. 
—While I hesitated between different opinions
of the matter, that friend, who (as told you
before) was a little hot-headed, favoured me with
a visit, and having heard a circumstantial account
of the whole affair, could not contain his indignation,
but affirmed without ceremony, that
Marmozet was the sole occasion of my disappointment; 
that he had acted from first to last with the
most perfidious dissimulation, cajoling with insinuating
civilities, while he underhand employed all his
art and influence to prejudice the ignorant manager
against my performance; that nothing could equal
his hypocrisy, but his avarice, which ingrossed the
faculties of his soul so much, that he scrupled not to
be guilty of the meanest practices to gratify that sordid
appetite; that in consequence of this disposition,
he had prostituted his honour in betraying my inexperience,
and in undermining the interest of
another author of established reputation, who had
also offered a tragedy to the stage, which he
thought would interfere with the success of the
comedy he had bought, and determined to bring
on at all events. 

I was shocked at the description of such a monster,
which I could not believe existed in the
world, bad as it is, and argued against the asseverations
of my friend, by demonstrating the bad
policy of such behaviour, which could not fail of
entailing infamy upon the author and the small
temptation that a man of Mr. Marmozet's figure
and success, could have to consult his interest in such
a groveling manner, which must create contempt and
abhorrence of him in his patrons, and effectually
deprive him of the countenance and protection
he now enjoys in such an eminent degree. — 
He pretended to laugh at my simplicity, and asked
if I knew for which of his virtues he was so
much caressed by the people of fashion. —“It is
not (said he) for the qualities of his heart,
that this little parasite is invited to the tables of
Dukes and Lords, who hire extraordinary
cooks for his entertainment: His avarice they
see not, his ingratitude they feel not, his hypocrisy
accommodates itself to their humours,
and is of consequence pleasing; but he is
chiefly courted for his buffoonery, and will be
admitted into the choicest parties of the quality
for his talent of mimicking Punch and his wife
Joan, when a poet of the most exquisite genius,
is not able to attract the least regard.” — 
God forbid, Mr. Random, that I should credit
assertions that degrade the dignity of our superiors
so much, and represent that poor man as the
most abject of all beings! No! I looked upon
them as the hyperboles of passion; and though
that comedy of which he spoke, did actually
appear, I dare not doubt the innocence of Mr.
Marmozet, who, I am told, is as much as ever
in favour with the Earl; a circumstance that, surely, 

could not happen, unless he had vindicated his
character to the satisfaction of his lordship. —Pray
forgive this long digression, and give me the hearing
a little longer; for, thank heaven! I am now
near the goal. 
Baffled in all my attempts, I despaired of seeing
my play acted, and bethought myself of chusing
some employment, that might afford a sure,
though mean subsistence; but my landlord, to
whom I was by this time considerably indebted,
and who had laid his account with having his
money paid all in a heap, from the profits
of my third night, could not brook his disappointment,
therefore made another effort in my
behalf, and by dint of interest, procured a message
from a lady of fashion, to Mr. Brayer, who
had always professed a great veneration for her,
desiring that he would set up my play forthwith,
and assuring him that she and all her friends
would support it in the performance: To
strengthen my interest, she engaged his best actors
in my cause; and in short, exerted herself
so much, that it was again received, and my
hopes began to revive. —But Mr. Brayer, honest
man, was so much engrossed by business of vast
consequence, though to appearance he had nothing
at all to do, that he could not find time to read
it until the season was pretty far advanced; and
read it he must, for notwithstanding his having
perused it before, his memory did not retain one
circumstance of the matter. 
At length he favoured it with his attention, and
having proposed certain alterations, sent his duty
to the lady who patronized it, and promised on
his honour, to bring it on next winter, provided
these alterations should be made, and the copy 

delivered to him before the end of April. —With
an aching heart, I submitted to these conditions,
and performed them accordingly: But fortune
owed me another unforeseen mortification; Mr.
Marmozet during the summer, became joint patentee
with Mr. Brayer, so that when I claimed
performance of articles, I was told, he could do
nothing without the consent of his partner, who
was pre-engaged to another author. 
My condition was rendered desperate by the
death of my good friend and landlord, whose
executors obtained a judgment against my effects,
which they seized, turning me out into the street
naked, friendless, and forlorn there I was arrested
at the suit of my taylor, and thrown into
this prison, where I have made shift to live these
five weeks on the bounty of my fellow-prisoners,
who, I hope, are not the worse for the instruction
and good offices, by which I manifest my gratitude
but in spite of all their charitable endeavours,
my life was scarce tolerable, until your
uncommon benevolence enabled me to enjoy it
with comfort.
