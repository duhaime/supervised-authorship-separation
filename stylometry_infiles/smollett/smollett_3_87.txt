He prosecutes his design upon Emilia with great art
and perseverance. 
Our adventurer, having by his hypocrisy
obtained free access to his mistress, began
the siege, by professing the most sincere contrition
for his former levity, and imploring her forgiveness
with such earnest supplication, that, 

guarded as she was against his flattering arts, she
began to believe his protestations, which were
even accompanied with tears, and abated a good
deal of that severity and distance she had proposed
to maintain, during this interview. She
would not, however, favour him with the least
acknowledgment of a mutual passion, because, in
the midst of his vows of eternal constancy and
truth, he did not mention one syllable of wedlock,
though he was now intirely master of his
own conduct; and this consideration created a
doubt, which fortified her against all his attacks:
yet, what her discretion would have concealed,
was discovered by her eyes, which, in spite of all
her endeavours, breathed forth complacency and
love. For, her inclination was flattered by her
own self-sufficiency, which imputed her admirer's
silence, in that particular, to the hurry and perturbation
of his spirits, and persuaded her, that
he could not possibly regard her with any other
than honourable intentions. 
The insidious lover exulted in the tenderness
of her looks, from which he presaged a compleat
victory: but, that he might not over-shoot himself
by his own precipitation, he would not run
the risk of declaring himself, until her heart
should be so far entangled within his snares, as
that neither the suggestions of honour, prudence,
or pride should be able to disengage it. Armed
with this resolution, he restrained the impatience
of his temper within the limits of the most delicate
deportment; and after having solicited and
obtained permission to attend her to the next
opera, took her by the hand, and pressing it to
his lips in the most respectful manner, went
away, leaving her in a most whimsical state of 

suspence, checquered with an interesting vicissitude
of hope and fear. 
On the appointed day, he appeared again about
five o'clock in the afternoon, and found her native
charms so much improved by the advantages
of dress, that he was transported with admiration
and delight; and while he conducted her to the
Hay-market, could scarce bridle the impetuosity
of his passion, so as to observe the forbearing
maxims he had adopted. When she entered the
pit, he had abundance of food for the gratification
of his vanity; for, in a moment, she eclipsed
all the female part of the audience, each individual
allowing in her own heart, that the stranger
was by far the handsomest woman there present,
except herself. 
Here it was that our hero enjoyed a double
triumph; he was vain of this opportunity to enhance
his reputation for gallantry among the ladies
of fashion, who knew him, and proud of
an occasion to display his quality-acquaintance to
Emilia, that she might entertain the greater idea
of the conquest she had made, and pay the more
deference to his importance in the sequel of his
addresses. That he might profit as much as possible
by this situation, he went up and accosted
every person in the pit, with whom he ever had
the least communication, whispered and laughed
with an affected air of familiarity, and even
bowed at a distance to some of the nobility, on
the slender foundation of having stood near them
at court, or presented them with a pinch of Rappee
at White's chocolate-house. 
This ridiculous ostentation, though now practised
with a view of promoting his design, was
a weakness that, in some degree, infected the 

whole of his behaviour; for nothing gave him
so much joy in conversation, as an opportunity
of giving the company to understand, how
well he was with persons of distinguished rank
and character: he would often (for example)
observe, as it were occasionally, that the duke
of G&wblank; was one of the best natured men in
the world, and illustrate his assertion by some instance
of his affability, in which he himself was
concerned: then, by an abrupt transition, he
would repeat some repartee of lady T&wblank;, and
mention a certain bon mot of the earl of C&wblank;,
which was uttered in his hearing. 
Abundance of young men, in this manner,
make free with the names, though they have never
had access to the persons of the nobility: but,
this was not the case with Peregrine, who, in
consideration of his appearance and supposed fortune,
together with the advantage of his introduction,
was by this time freely admitted to the
tables of the great. 
In his return with Emilia from the opera,
though he still maintained the most scrupulous
decorum in his behaviour, he plied her with the
most passionate expressions of love, squeezed her
hand with great fervency, protested that his whole
soul was ingrossed by her idea, and that he could
not exist independent of her favour. Pleased as
she was with his warm and pathetic addresses, together
with the respectful manner of his making
love, she yet had prudence and resolution sufficient
to contain her tenderness, which was ready
to run over; being fortified against his arts, by
reflecting, that if his aim was honourable, it was
now his business to declare it. On this consideration,
she refused to make any serious reply to 

his earnest expostulations, but affected to receive
them as the undetermined effusions of gallantry
and good breeding. 
This fictitious gaiety and good humour, though
it baffled his hope of extorting from her an acknowledgment
of which he might have taken
immediate advantage, nevertheless encouraged
him to observe, (as the chariot passed along the
Strand) that the night was far advanced; that
supper would certainly be over, before they could
reach her uncle's house; and to propose, that he
should wait upon her to some place, where they
might be accommodated with a slight refreshment. 
She was offended at the freedom of this proposal,
which, however, she treated as a joke, thanking
him for his courteous offer, and assuring him,
that when she should be disposed for a tavern-treat,
he alone should have the opportunity of bestowing
it. 
Her kinsman being engaged with company abroad,
and her aunt retired to rest, he had the good fortune
to enjoy a tête a tête with her during a whole
hour, which he employed with such consummate
skill, that her caution was almost overcome. He
not only assailed her with the artillery of sighs,
vows, prayers and tears, but even pawned his
honour in behalf of his love. He swore with
many imprecations, that although her heart were
surrendered to him at discretion, there was a
principle within him, which would never allow
him to injure such innocence and beauty; and
the transports of his passion had, upon this occasion,
so far overshot his purpose, that if she had
demanded an explanation, while he was thus agitated,
he would have engaged himself to her
wish by such ties, as he could not possibly break, 

with any regard to his reputation. But, from
such expostulation, she was deterred partly by
pride, and partly by the dread of finding herself
mistaken in such an interesting conjecture. She
therefore enjoyed the present flattering appearance
of her fate, was prevailed upon to accept the
jewels which he had purchased with part of his
winning at Bath, and with the most inchanting
condescension submitted to a warm embrace,
when he took his leave, after having obtained
permission to visit her, as often as his inclination
and convenience would permit. 
In his return to his own lodgings, he was
buoyed up with his success to an extravagance
of hope, already congratulated himself upon his
triumph over Emilia's virtue, and began to project
future conquests among the most dignified
characters of the female sex. But his attention
was not at all dissipated by these vain reflections; 
he resolved to concentrate the whole exertion of
his soul upon the execution of his present plan,
desisted, in the mean time, from all other schemes
of pleasure, interest and ambition, and took
lodgings in the city, for the more commodious
accomplishment of his purpose. 
While our lover's imagination was thus agreeably
regaled, his mistress did not enjoy her expectations,
without the intervention of doubts
and anxiety. His silence touching the final aim
of his addresses was a mystery on which she was
afraid of exercising her sagacity; and her uncle
tormented her with inquiries into the circumstances
of Peregrine's professions and deportment. 
Rather than give this relation the least cause of
suspicion, which must have cut off all intercourse
betwixt her and her admirer, she said every thing 

which she thought would satisfy his care and concern
for her welfare; and in consequence of such
representation, she enjoyed, without reserve, the
company of our adventurer, who prosecuted his
plan with surprising eagerness and perseverance.
