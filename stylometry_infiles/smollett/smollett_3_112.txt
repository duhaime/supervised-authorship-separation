Peregrine finding himself neglected by Sir Steady
Steerwell, expostulates with him in a letter; in
consequence of which, he is forbid his house,
loses his pension, and incurs the reputation of a
lunatick. 
This prospect of success, together with
his expectations from the minister, whom
he did not neglect, helped to comfort him under
the reverse of fortune which he had undergone,
and the uncertainty of the law-suit, which he
still maintained for the recovery of his ten thousand
pounds. The lawyers, indeed, continued
to drain his pocket of money, while they filled
his brain with unsubstantial hope; and he was
actually obliged to borrow money from his book-seller,
on the strength of the translation, in order
to satisfy the demands of those ravenous harpies,
rather than lay the misanthrope under any difficulties,
or have recourse to his friend Hatchway,
who lived at the garrison, intirely ignorant of
his distress: and this was not at all alleviated by
the arrival of the Indiaman, in which he had
ventured seven hundred pounds, as we have already
observed; for he was given to understand,
that the borrower was left dangerously ill at
Bombay when the ship sailed, and that his chance
for retrieving his money was extremely slender. 

So situated, it is not to be supposed that he led
a life of tranquillity, tho' he made a shift to
struggle with the remonstrances of misfortune:
yet such a gush of affliction would sometimes rush
upon his thought, as overwhelmed all the ideas
of his hope, and sunk him to the very bottom of
despondence. Every equipage that passed him in
the street, every person of rank and fortune that
occurred to his view, recalled the gay images of
his former life, with such mortifying reflection as
stabbed him to the very soul. He lived, therefore,
incessantly exposed to all the pangs of envy
and disquiet. When I say envy, I do not mean
that sordid passion, in consequence of which a
man repines at his neighbour's success, howsoever
deserved; but that self-tormenting indignation
which is inspired by the prosperity of folly, ignorance
and vice. Without the intervening gleams
of enjoyment, which he felt in the conversation
of a few friends, he could not have supported his
existence; or, at least, he must, have suffered
some violent discomposure of the brain: but one
is still finding some circumstance of alleviation,
even in the worst of conjunctures; and Pickle
was so ingenious in these researches, that he
maintained a good battle with disappointment,
till the revolution of the term at which he had
received his pension of three hundred pounds. 
However, seeing the day elapse, without touching
his allowance, notwithstanding his significant
method of presenting himself at the minister's
levee, when the year was expired, he wrote a
letter to Sir Steady, reminding him of his situation
and promise, and giving him to understand,
that his occasions were such, as compelled him to
demand his salary for the ensuing year. 

In the morning after this letter was conveyed,
the author went to his honour's house, in expectation
of being admitted by particular order; but
was mistaken in his hope, the minister not being
visible. He then made his appearance at the
levee, in hopes of being closetted; but though
he took all opportunities of watching Sir Steady's
eyes, he could not obtain one glance, and had
the pleasure of seeing him retire, without being
favoured with the least notice. These circumstances
of wilful neglect were not over and above
agreeable to our hero, who, in the agonies of
vexation and resentment, went home, and composed
a most acrimonious remonstrance to his honour; 
in consequence of which, he was not only
deprived of all pretensions to a private audience,
but expressly denied admittance on a public day,
by Sir Steady's own order. 
This prohibition, which announced his total
ruin, filled him with rage, horror and despair:
he cursed the porter who signified the minister's
command, threatening to chastise him upon the
spot for his presumption, and vented the most virulent
imprecations upon his master, to the astonishment
of those who chanced to enter during
this conference. Having exhausted himself in
these vain exclamations, he returned to his lodgings
in a most frantic condition, biting his lips so
that the blood ran from his mouth, dashing his
head and fists against the sides of his chimney,
and weeping with the most bitter expressions of
woe. 
Pipes, whose perception had been just sufficient
to let him see, that there was some difference
between the present and former situation of his
master, over-hearing his transports, essayed to 

enter his apartment, with a view of administring
consolation; and finding the door locked on the
inside, desired admittance, protesting, that otherwise
he would down with the bulk-head, in the
turning of an hand-spike. Peregrine ordered him
to retire, on pain of his displeasure, and swore,
that if he should offer to break open the door,
he would instantly shoot him through the head. 
Tom, without paying the least regard to this
injunction, set himself at work immediately; 
and his master, exasperated at his want of reverence
and respect, which, in his present paroxysm,
appeared with the most provoking aggravation,
flew into his closet, and snatching up one of his
pistols already loaded, no sooner saw his valet
enter the apartment, in consequence of having
forced the lock, than he presented full at his
face, and drew the trigger, but happily the priming
flashed in the pan, without communicating
with the charge; so that his furious purpose did
not take effect upon the countenance of honest
Pipes, who disregardful of the attempt, though
he knew the contents of the piece, asked, without
the least alteration of feature, if it must be
foul weather through the whole voyage. 
Peregrine, mad as he was, repented of his
mischievous intent against such a faithful adherent,
in the very moment of execution; and
had it proved fatal, according to the design, in
all probability he would have applied another to
his own head. There are certain considerations
that strike upon the mind with irresistible force,
even in the midst of its distraction; the momentary
recollection of some particular scene, occasioned
by the features of the devoted victim, 

hath often struck the dagger from the assassin's
hand. By such an impulse was Pipes protected
from any repeated effort of his master's rage; 
the friendly cause of his present disobedience
flashed upon the conviction of Peregrine, when
he beheld the rugged front of his valet, in which
also stood disclosed his long and faithful service,
together with the recommendation of the deceased
commodore. 
Though his wrath was immediately suppressed,
and his heart torn with remorse for what he had
done, his brows remained still contracted; and
darting a most ferocious regard at the intruder,
“Villain! (said he) how dare you treat me
with such disrespect?” “Why shouldn't I lend
a hand for the preservation of the ship, (answered
the unruffled Pipes) when there is more sail than
ballast aboard, and the pilot quits the helm in despair? 
What signifies one or two broken voyages,
so long as our timbers are strong, and our vessel
in good trim: if she loses upon one tack, mayhap
she may gain upon another; and I'll be damn'd,
if one day or other we don't fetch up our lee-way:
as for the matter of provision, you have
started a pretty good stock of money into my
hold, and you are welcome to hoist it up again
when you wool?” 
Here Tom was interrupted by the arrival of
Mr. Crabtree, who seeing Peregrine with a pistol
in his hand, and such wild disorder in his looks,
his head, hands and mouth besmeared with blood,
and, moreover, smelling the gunpowder which
had been burnt, actually believed he had either
committed, or was bent upon murder, and, accordingly,
retreated down stairs with infinite dispatch; 
though all his speed could not convey 

him without the reach of Pipes, who overtaking
him in the passage, carried him back into his
master's apartment, observing by the way, that
this was no time to sheer off, when his consort
stood in need of his assistance. 
There was something so ruefully severe in the
countenance of Cadwallader, thus compelled, that
at any other time, our hero would have laughed
at his concern; but at present, there was nothing
risible in his disposition: he had, however,
laid aside his pistol, and endeavoured, though in
vain, to compose his internal disturbance; for he
could not utter one syllable to the Misanthrope,
but stood staring at him in silence, with a most
delirious aspect, which did not tend to dispel the
dismay of his friend, who, after some recollection,
“I wonder, (said he) that you have never
killed your man before. Pray, how may you
have disposed of the body?” Pickle having recovered
the faculty of speech, ordered his lacquey
out of the room, and in a most incoherent detail,
made Crabtree acquainted with the perfidious
conduct of the minister. 
The confident was very glad to find his fears
disappointed; for he had really concluded, that
some life was lost: and perceiving the youth
too much agitated to be treated by him in his
usual stile, he owned that Sir Steady was a rascal,
encouraged Pickle with the hope of being one day
able to make reprisals upon him; in the mean time,
offered hi money for his immediate occasions,
exhorted him to exert his own qualifications in
rendering himself independent of such miscreants,
and finally, counselled him to represent his wrongs
to the nobleman whom he had formerly obliged,
with a view of interesting that peer in his behalf, 

or at least of obtaining a satisfactory explanation
from the minister, that he might take no premature
measures of revenge. 
These admonitions were so much milder, and
more agreeable than our hero expected from the
Misanthrope, that they had a very favourable effect
upon his transports, which gradually subsided,
until he became so tractable, as to promise
that he would conform to his advice; in consequence
of which, he next morning waited upon
his lordship, who received him very politely, as
usual, and with great patience heard his complaint,
which, by the bye, he could not repeat
without some hasty ebullitions of passionate resentment. 
This peer, after having gently disapproved
of the letter of postulation, which had
produced such unfortunate effects, kindly undertook
to recommend his case to the minister, and
actually performed his promise that same day,
when Sir Steady informed him, to his utter astonishment,
that the poor young gentleman was
disordered in his brain, so that he could not possibly
be provided for in a place of importance,
with any regard to the service; and it could not
be expected that he (Sir Steady) would support
his extravagance from his own private purse:
that he had indeed, at the solicitation of a nobleman
deceased, made him a present of three
hundred pounds, in consideration of some loss
that he pretended to have sustained in an election; 
but, since that time, had perceived in
him such indisputable marks of lunacy, both
by his distracted letters and personal behaviour,
as obliged him to give order, that he should not
be admitted into the house. To corroborate this
assertion, the minister actually called in the evidence 

of his own porter, and one of the gentlemen
of his houshold, who had heard the execrations that
escaped our youth, when he first found himself
excluded. In short, the nobleman was convinced,
that Peregrine was certainly and bona fide mad
as a March hare; and, by the help of this intimation,
began to recollect some symptoms of
distraction which appeared in his last visit; he remembered
a certain incoherence in his speech, a
violence of gesture and wildness of look, that
now evidently denoted a disturbed understanding:
and he determined, for his own credit and security,
to disentangle himself from such a dangerous
acquaintance. 
With this view, he, in imitation of Sir Steady,
commanded his gate to be shut against our adventurer; 
so that when he went to know the result
of his lordship's conference with the minister,
the door was flung in his face, and the janitor
told him through an iron grate, that he
needed not give himself the trouble of calling
again, for his lord desired to be excused from
seeing him. He spoke not a word in answer to
this declaration, which he immediately imputed
to the ill offices of the minister, against whom he
breathed defiance and revenge, in his way to the
lodgings of Cadwallader; who being made acquainted
with the manner of his reception, begg'd
he would desist from all schemes of vengeance,
until he (Crabtree) should be able to unriddle
the mystery of the whole, which he did not doubt
of unveiling, by means of his acquaintance with
a family, in which his lordship often spent the
evening at whist. 
It was not long before he had the desired opportunity; 
the nobleman being under no injunctions 

or obligation to keep the affair secret,
discovered the young gentleman's misfortune, by
way of news, to the first company in which he
happened to be; and Peregrine's name was not
so obscure in the fashionable world, but that his
disorder became the general topic of conversation
for a day; so that his friend soon partook of the
intelligence, and found means to learn the particulars
of the minister's information, as above
related. Nay, he was in danger of becoming a
proselyte to Sir Steady's opinion, when he recalled
and compared every circumstance which he
knew of Pickle's impatience and impetuosity. 
Indeed, nothing more easily gains credit than
an imputation of madness fixed upon any person
whatsoever: for when the suspicion of the world
is roused, and its observation once set at work,
the wisest, the coolest man upon earth, will, by
some particulars in his behaviour, convict himself
of the charge: every singularity in his dress and
manner (and such are observable in every person)
that before passed unheeded, now rises up in judgment
against him, with all the exaggeration of
the observer's fancy; and the sagacious examiner
perceives distraction in every glance of the eye,
turn of the finger, and motion of the head:
when he speaks, there is a strange peculiarity in
his argument and expression; when he holds his
tongue, his imagination teems with some extravagant
reverie; his sobriety of demeanour is no
other than a lucid interval, and his passion mere
delirium. 
If people of the most sedate and insipid life and
conversation are subject to such criticisms, no
wonder that they should take place upon a youth
of Peregrine's fiery disposition, which, on some 

occasions, would have actually justified any remarks
of this kind, which his greatest enemies
could make. He was accordingly represented as
one of those enterprizing Bucks, who, after having
spent their fortunes in riot and excess, are
happily bereft of their understanding, and consequently
insensible of the want and disgrace which
they have intailed upon themselves. 
Cadwallader himself was so much affected with
the report, that for some time he hesitated in his
deliberations upon our hero, before he could prevail
upon himself to communicate to him the information
he had received, or to treat him in
other respects as a man of sound intellects. At
length, however, he ventured to make Pickle acquainted
with the particulars he had learn'd, imparting
them with such caution and circumlocution,
as he thought necessary to prevent the
young gentleman from transgressing all bounds of
temper and moderation: but, for once, he was
agreably deceived in his prognostic. Incensed as
our hero was at the conduct of the minister, he
could not help laughing at the ridiculous aspersion,
which, he told his friend, he would soon
refute in a manner that should not be very agreeable
to his calumniator; observing that it was a
common practice with this state pilot, thus to
slander those people to whom he lay under obligations
which he had no mind to discharge. 
“True it is, (said Peregrine) he has succeeded
more than once in contrivances of this kind,
having actually reduced divers people of weak
heads to such extremity of despair, as hath issued
in downright distraction, whereby he was rid of
their importunities, and his judgment confirmed
at the same time: but I have now (thank heaven) 

attained to such a pitch of philosophical resolution,
as will support me against all his machinations; 
and I will forthwith exhibit the monster
to the public, in his true lineaments of craft, perfidy
and ingratitude.” 
This indeed was the plan with which Mr.
Pickle had amused himself during the researches
of Crabtree; and by this time it so effectually
flattered his imagination, that he believed he
should be able to bring his adversary (in spite of
all his power) to his own terms of submission,
by distinguishing himself in the list of those who,
at that period, wrote against the administration. 
Nor was this scheme so extravagant as it may
seem to be, had not he overlooked one material
circumstance, which Cadwallader himself did not
recollect, when he approved of this project. 
While he thus meditated vengeance, the fame
of his disorder, in due course of circulation, reached
the ears of that lady of quality, whose memoirs have
appeared in the third volume of these adventures. 
The correspondence with which she had honoured
our hero had been long broke off, for the reason already
advanced, namely, his dread of being exposed
to her infatuating charms. He had been candid
enough to make her acquainted with this cause of
exiling himself from her presence; and she admitted
the prudence of his self-restraint, although
she could have been very well satisfied with the
continuance of his intimacy and conversation,
which were not at all beneath the desire of any
lady in the kingdom. Notwithstanding this interruption,
she still retained a friendship and regard
for his character, and felt all the affliction of
a humane heart, at the news of his misfortunes
and deplorable distemper. She had seen him 

courted and cultivated in the sun-shine of his prosperity; 
but she knew from sad experience, how
all those insect followers shrink away in the winter
of distress. Her compassion represented him as
a poor unhappy lunatic, destitute of all the necessaries
of life, dragging about the ruins of human
nature, and exhibiting the spectacle of blasted
youth, to the scorn and abhorrence of his fellow-creatures. 
Aking with these charitable considerations,
she found means to learn in what part
of the town he lodged; and laying aside all superfluous
ceremony, went in a hackney-chair to
his door, which was opened by the ever-faithful
Pipes. 
Her ladyship immediately recollected the features
of this trusty follower, whom she could not
help loving in her heart, for his attachment and
fidelity, which, after she had applauded with a
most gracious commendation, she kindly inquired
after the state of his master's health, and asked if
he was in a condition to be seen. 
Tom, who could not suppose that the visit of
a fine lady would be unacceptable to a youth of
Peregrine's complexion, made no verbal reply to
the question; but beckoning her ladyship with an
arch significance of feature, at which she could
not forbear smiling, he walked softly up stairs; 
and she, in obedience to the signal, followed her
guide into the apartment of our hero, whom she
found at a writing-table, in the very act of composing
an eulogium upon his good friend Sir
Steady. The nature of his work had animated
his countenance with an uncommon degree of
vivacity; and being dressed in a neat dishabille,
his figure could not have appeared to more advantage,
in the eye of a person who despised the 

tinsel of unnecessary ornament. She was extremely
well pleased to see the expectations so
agreeably disappointed; for, instead of the squalid
circumstances and wretched looks attending indigence
and distraction, every thing was decent and
genteel; and the patient's aspect such, as betokened
internal satisfaction. Hearing the rustling
of silk in his room, he lifted up his eyes from the
paper, and seeing her ladyship, was struck with
astonishment and awe, as at the unexpected apparition
of some supernatural being. 
Before he could recollect himself from his confusion,
which called the blood into his cheeks,
she told him, that, on the strength of old acquaintance,
she was come to visit him, though it
was a long time since he had given her good reason
to believe, he had absolutely forgot that there
was such a person as she in being. After having
made the most warm acknowledgments for this
unforeseen honour, he assured her ladyship, that
the subject of her reproach was not his fault, but
rather his very great misfortune; and that if it
had been in his power to forget her so easily, as
she seemed to imagine, he should never have
given her cause to tax him with want of duty and
respect. 
Still dubious of his situation, she began to converse
with him on different subjects; and he acquitted
himself so well in every particular, that
she no longer doubted his having been misrepresented
by the malice of his enemies; and candidly
told him the cause and intent of her coming. 
He was not deficient in expressions of gratitude
for this instance of her generosity and friendship,
which even drew tears from his eyes; and as to
the imputation of madness, he explained it so 

much to her ladyship's satisfaction, that she evidently
perceived he had been barbarously dealt
with, and that the charge was no other than a
most villainous aspersion. 
Notwithstanding all his endeavours to conceal
the true state of his finances, it was impossible
for him to give this detail, without disclosing
some of the difficulties under which he laboured; 
and her ladyship's sagacity divining the rest, she
not only made him a tender of assistance, but
presenting a bank-note for a considerable sum,
insisted upon his acceptance of it, as a trifling
mark of her esteem, and a specimen of what she
was inclined to do in his behalf. But this mark
of her benevolence he would by no means receive; 
assuring her, that though his affairs were
at present a little perplexed, he had never felt
the least circumstance of distress, and begging that
she would not subject him to the burthen of such
an unnecessary obligation. 
Being obliged to put up with this refusal, she
protested she would never forgive him, should
she ever hear that he rejected her offer, when he
stood in need of her aid; or if in time to come,
he should not apply to her friendship, if ever he
should find himself incommoded in point of fortune: 
“An over-delicacy in this respect (said
she) I shall look upon as a disapprobation of my
own conduct; because I myself have been obliged
to have recourse to my friends, in such
emergencies.” 
These generous remonstrances and marks of
particular friendship, could not fail to make deep
impression upon the heart of our hero, which still
smarted from the former impulse of her charms:
he not only felt all those transports which a man 

of honour and sensibility may be supposed to feel
upon such an occasion, but the sentiments of a
more tender passion awaking in his breast, he
could not help expressing himself in terms adapted
to the emotions of his soul; and at length plainly
told her, that were he disposed to be a beggar,
he would ask something of infinitely more importance
to his peace, than the charitable assistance
she had proffered. 
Her ladyship had too much penetration to
mistake his meaning; but as she did not chuse to
encourage his advances, pretended to interpret
his intimation into a general compliment of gallantry,
and in a jocose manner, desired he would
not give her any reason to believe his lucid interval
was past. “In faith, my lady, (said he)
I perceive the fit coming on; and I don't see
why I may not use the privilege of my distemper,
so far as to declare myself one of your
most passionate admirers.” “If you do, (replied
her ladyship) I shall not be fool enough to
believe a madman, unless I were assured that your
disorder proceeded from your love: and that this
was the case, I suppose you would find it difficult
to prove.” “Nay, Madam, (cried the youth)
I have in this drawer, what will convince you of
my having been mad on that strain; and since
you doubt my pretensions, you must give me
leave to produce my testimonials.” So saying,
he opened a scrutore, and taking out a paper,
presented her with the following song, which he
had written in her praise, immediately after he
was made acquainted with the particulars of her
story. 



I
While with fond rapture and amaze,
On thy transcendent charms I gaze,
My cautious soul essays in vain
Her peace and freedom to maintain:
Yet let that blooming form divine,
Where grace and harmony combine,
Those eyes, like genial orbs, that move,
Dispensing gladness, joy and love,
In all their pomp assail my view,
Intent my bosom to subdue;
My breast, by wary maxims steel'd,
Not all those charms shall force to yield. 

II
But, when invok'd to beauty's aid,
I see th' enlighten'd soul display'd;
That soul so sensibly sedate
Amid the storms of froward fate!
Thy genius active, strong and clear,
Thy wit sublime, tho' not severe,
The social ardour void of art,
That glows within thy candid heart;
My spirits, sense and strength decay,
My resolution dies away,
And ev'ry faculty opprest,
Almighty love invades my breast!
Her ladyship having perused this production,
“Were I inclined to be suspicious, (said she)
I should believe that I had no share in producing
this composition, which seems to have been inspired
by a much more amiable object. However,
I will take your word for your intention,
and thank you for the unmerited compliment,
though I have met with it in such an accidental 

manner. Nevertheless, I must be so free as to
tell you, it is now high time for you to contract
that unbounded spirit of gallantry, which you
have indulged so long, into a sincere attachment
for the fair Emilia, who, by all accounts, deserves
the whole of your attention and regard.” 
His nerves thrilled at mention of that name,
which he never heard pronounced without agitation; 
and rather than undergo the consequence
of a conversation upon this subject, he chose to
drop the theme of love altogether, and industriously
introduced some other topic of discourse.
