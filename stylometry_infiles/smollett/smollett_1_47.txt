Renaldo's distress deepens, and Fathom's plot
thickens. 
Such aggravated misfortune could not fail
to affect his temper and deportment: the
continual efforts he made to conceal his vexation
produced a manifest distraction in his behaviour
and discourse. He began to be seized
with horror at the sight of poor Monimia,
whom he therefore shunned as much as the
circumstances of their correspondence would
allow; and every evening he went forth alone
to some solitary place, where he could unperceived
give a loose to the transports of his
sorrow, and in silence meditate some means to
lighten the burden of his woe. His heart was
sometimes so savaged with despair, which represented
mankind as his inveterate enemies,
that he entertained thoughts of denouncing
war against the whole community, and supplying
his own wants with the spoils he should
win: at other times, he was tempted with the
desire of putting an end to his miseries and life
together: yet these were but the transitory
suggestions of temporary madness, that soon
yielded to the dictates of reason. From the
execution of the first, he was restrained by his
own notions of honour and morality; and
from using the other expedient, he was deterred
by his love for Monimia, together with the
motives of philosophy and religion. 
While in this manner he secretly nursed the 

worm of grief that preyed upon his vitals, the
alteration of his countenance and conduct did
not escape the eye of that discerning young
lady. She was alarmed at the change, yet
afraid to inquire into the source of it; for,
being ignorant of his distress, she could impute
it to no cause in which her happiness was not
deeply interested. She had observed his strained
complaisance, and extraordinary emotion:
she had detected him in repeated attempts to
avoid her company, and taken notice of his
regular excursions in the dark. These were
alarming symptoms to a lover of her delicacy
and pride: she strove in vain to put the most
favourable construction on what she saw; and
finally, imputed the effects of his despondence
to the alienation of his heart. Made miserable
beyond expression by these suspicions, she
imparted them to Fathom, who by this time
was in full possession of her confidence and
esteem, and implored his advice touching her
conduct in such a nice conjuncture. 
This artful politician, who rejoiced at the
effect of her penetration, no sooner heard himself
questioned on the subject, than he gave
tokens of surprize and confusion, signifying his
concern to find she had discovered what (for
the honour of his friend) he wished had never
come to light. His behaviour on this occasion
confirmed her fatal conjecture; and she conjured
him in the most pathetic manner, to tell
her if he thought Renaldo's heart had contracted
any new engagement. At this question,
he started with signs of extreme agitation,
and stifling an artificial sigh, “Sure, madam,
said he, you cannot doubt the Count's constancy 

—I am confident—he is certainly&wblank;I protest,
madam, I am so shocked”— 
Here he made a full pause, as if the conflict
between his integrity and his friendship would
not allow him to proceed, and summoned the
moisture into either eye. —“Then are my
doubts removed, cried the afflicted Monimia: 
I see your candour in the midst of your attachment
to Renaldo, and will no longer torment you
with impertinent interrogations and vain complaints.” 
With these words, a flood of tears
gushed from her enchanting eyes, and she
instantly withdrew into her own apartment,
where she indulged her sorrow to excess. Nor
was her grief unanimated with resentment. 
She was, by birth, nature and education, inspired
with that dignity of pride which ennobles
the human heart; and this, by the circumstance
of her present dependance, was rendered
extremely jealous and susceptible: insomuch
that she could not brook the last shadow of
indifference, much less an injury of such a
nature from the man whom she had honoured
with her affections, and for whom she had
disobliged and deserted her family and friends. 
Though her love was so unalterably fixed on
this unhappy youth that, without the continuation
of reciprocal regard, her life would have
become an unsupportable burden, even amidst
all the splendour of affluence and pomp; and
altho' she foresaw, that when his protection
should cease, she must be left a wretched
orphan in a foreign land, exposed to all the
miseries of want: yet, such was the loftiness
of her displeasure, that she disdained to complain,
or even demand an explanation from the 

author of her wrongs. While she continued
undetermined in her purpose, and fluctuating on
this sea of torture, Fathom, believing that now
was the season for working upon her passions,
while they were all in commotion, became, if
possible, more assiduous than ever about the fair
mourner, modelled his features into a melancholy
cast, pretended to share her distress with the
most emphatic sympathy, and endeavoured to
keep her resentment glowing by cunning insinuations,
which, tho' apparently designed to apologize
for his friend, served only to aggravate the
guilt of his perfidy and dishonour. This pretext
of friendly concern, is the most effectual vehicle
for the conveyance of malice and slander: 
And a man's reputation is never so mortally stabbed,
as when the assassin begins with the preamble
of, “For my own part, I can safely say, that
no man upon earth has a greater regard for him
than I have; and it is with the utmost anguish
and concern that I see him misbehave in such
a manner.” Then he proceeds to mangle his
character, and the good-natured hearers concluding
he is even blacker than he is represented,
on the supposition that the most attrocious
circumstances are softened or suppressed by the
tenderness or friendship of the accuser, exclaim,
“Good lack! what a wretch he must be
when his best friends will no longer attempt to
defend him!” Nay, sometimes these well-wishers
undertake his defence, and treacherously betray
the cause they have espoused, by omitting
the reasons that may be urged in his vindication. 
Both these methods were practised by the
wily Ferdinand, according to the predominant
passion of Monimia: when her indignation 

prevailed, he expatiated upon his love and sincere
regard for Renaldo, which, he said, had grown
up from the cradle, to such a degree of fervour,
that he would willingly part with life for
his advantage. He shed his tears for his apostacy; 
but every drop made an indelible stain
upon his character: and, in the bitterness of
his grief, swore, notwithstanding his fondness
for Renaldo, which had become a part of his
constitution, that the young Hungarian deserved
the most infamous destiny, for having
injured such perfection. At other times,
when he found her melted into silent sorrow,
he affected to excuse the conduct of his friend. 
He informed her, that the young gentleman's
temper had been uneven from his infancy:
that frailty was natural to man; that he might
in time be reclaimed by self-conviction; he even
hinted, that she might have probably ascribed
to inconstancy, what was really the effect of
some chagrin which he industriously concealed
from her participation: but, when he found her
disposed to listen to this last suggestion, he destroyed
the force of it, by recollecting the circumstances
of his nocturnal rambles, which,
he owned, would admit of no favourable construction. 
By these means he blew the coals of her jealousy,
and inhanced the value of his own character,
at the same time; for she looked upon
him as a mirror of faith and integrity, and the
mind being overcharged with woe, naturally
seeks some confident, upon whose sympathy it
can repose itself: indeed, his great aim was, to
make himself necessary to her affliction, and
settle a gossiping correspondence, in the familiarity 

of which he hoped his purpose would certainly
be answered. 
Yet the exertion of these talents was not limited
to her alone. While he laid these trains
for the hapless young lady, he was preparing
snares of another kind for her unsuspecting
lover, who (for the completion of his misery)
about this time began to perceive marks of disquiet
and displeasure in the countenance and
deportment of his adored Monimia: for, that
young lady, in the midst of her grief, remembered
her origin, and over her vexation affected to
throw a veil of tranquillity, which served only
to give an air of disgust to her internal disturbance. 
Renaldo, whose patence and philosophy were
barely sufficient to bear the load of his other
evils, would have ben quite overwhelmed with
the additional burthen of Monimia's woe, if it
had not assumed this appearance of disesteem,
which, as he knew he had not deserved it,
brought his resentment to his assistance: Yet
this was but a wretched cordial to support him
against the baleful reflections that assaulted him
from every quarter; it operated like those desperate
remedies, which while they stimulate
exhausted nature, help to destroy the very fundamentals
of the constitution. He reviewed
his own conduct with the utmost severity, and
could not recollect one circumstance which
could justly offend the idol of his soul. The
more blameless he appeared to himself in this
examination, the less excusable did her behaviour
appear: He tasked his penetration to discover
the cause of this alteration; he burned
with impatience to know it; his discernment 

failed him, and he was afraid (tho' he knew
not why) to demand an explanation. His
thoughts were so circumstanced, that he durst
not even unbosom himself to Fathom, tho' his
own virtue and friendship resisted those sentiments
that began to intrude upon his mind,
with suggestions to the prejudice of our adventurer's
fidelity. 
Nevertheless, unable to endure the torments
of such interesting suspence, he, at length, made
an effort to expostulate with the fair orphan; 
and in an abrupt address, the effect of his fear
and confusion, begged to know if he had inadvertently
done any thing to incur her displeasure. 
Monimia, hearing herself bluntly accosted
in this unusual strain, after repeated instances
of his reserve and supposed inconstancy,
considered the question as a fresh insult, and
summoning her whole pride to her assistance,
replied with affected tranquillity, or rather with
an air of scorn, that she had no title to judge,
neither did she pretend to condemn his conduct. 
This answer, so wide of that tenderness
and concern which had hitherto manifested itself
in the disposition of his amiable mistress,
deprived him of all power to carry on the conversation,
and he retired with a low bow, fully
convinced of his having irretrievably lost the
place he had possessed in her affection; for,
to his imagination, warped and blinded by his
misfortunes, her demeanour seemed fraught,
not with a transient gleam of anger, which a
respectful lover would soon have appeased, but
with that contempt and indifference which
denote a total absence of affection and esteem. 
She, on the other hand, misconstrued his sudden 

retreat; and now they beheld the actions
of each other thro' the false medium of prejudice
and resentment. To such fatal misunderstandings,
the peace and happiness of whole
families often fall a sacrifice.
