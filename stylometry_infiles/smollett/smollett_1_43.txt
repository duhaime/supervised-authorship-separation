One quarrel is compromised, and another decided
by unusual arms. 
Among other topics of conversation that
were discussed at this genial meeting, Sir
Mungo's scheme was brought upon the carpet,
by his Majesty, who was graciously pleased to
ask how his subscription filled? To this interrogation,
the knight answered, that he met
with great opposition from a spirit of levity and
self conceit, which seemed to prevail in this
generation; but, that no difficulties should
discourage him, from persevering in his duty; 

and he trusted in God, that in a very little
time he should be able to confute and overthrow
the false philosophy of the moderns,
and to restore the writings of Moses to that
pre-heminence and veneration, which is due
to an inspired author. He spoke of the immortal
Newton with infinite contempt, and
undertook to extract from the Pentateuch, a
system of chronology, which would ascertain
the progress of rime since the fourth day of
the creation to the present hour with such exactness,
that not one vibration of a pendulum
should be lost! nay, be affirmed that the perfection
of all arts and sciences might be attained
by studying those sacred memoirs; and
that he himself did not dispair of learning
from them the art of transmuting baser metals
into gold. 
The chevalier, though he did not pretend
to contradict these assertions, was too much attached
to his own religion to acquiesce in the
knight's project of converting the Jews and
the Gentiles to the protestant heresy, which, he
said, God Almighty would never suffer to
triumph over the interests of his own holy catholic
church. This objection produced abundance
of altercation between two very unequal
disputants, and the Frenchman finding himself
puzzelled by the learning of his antagonist, had
recourse to the Argumentum ad hominem, by
laying his hand upon his sword, and declaring
that he was ready to lose the last drop of his
blood in opposition to such a damnable scheme. 
Sir Mungo, though in all appearance, reduced
to the last stage of animal existence, no
sooner heard this epithet applied to his plan, 

than his eyes gleamed like lightning; he sprung
from his seat, with the agility of a grass-hopper,
and darting himself out at the door, like an
arrow from a bow, re-appeared in a moment
with a long rusty weapon, which might have
been shewn among a collection of rarities, as
the sword of Guy earl of Warwick. This implement
he brandished over the chevalier's
head, with the dexterity of an old prize-fighter,
exclaiming in the French language, “Thou
art a prophane wretch marked out for the
vengeance of Heaven, whose unworthy minister
I am; and here thou shalt fall by the sword
of the Lord and of Gideon” 
The chevalier, unterrified by this dreadful
salutation, desired he would accompany him
to a more convenient place; and the world
might have been deprived of one or both these
knights-errant, had not general Macleaver, at
the desire of his majesty, interposed, and
found means to bring matters to an accommodation. 
In the afternoon, the society was visited by
the major's cousin and her daughters, who no
sooner appeared, than they were recognized
by our adventurer; and his acquaintance with
them renewed in such a manner as alarmed
the delicacy of captain Minikin, who in the
evening repaired to the count's apartment,
and with a very formal physiognomy, accosted
him in these words. “Sir, I beg pardon for
this intrusion; but I come to consult you about
an affair in which my honour is concerned; 
and a soldier without honour, you know,
is no better than a body without a soul. I 

have always admired that speech of Hotspur,
in the first part of Henry the fourth. 
“By Heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,
To pluck bright honour from the pale fac'd moon;
Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
Where fathom line could never touch the ground,
And pluck up drowned honour by the locks—.”
There is a boldness and ease in the expression,
and the images are very picturesque. But,
without any further preamble; pray Sir, give
me leave to ask how long you have been acquainted
with those ladies, who drank tea with
us this afternoon? You'll forgive the question
Sir, when I tell you that major Macleaver introduced
Mrs Minikin to them, as to ladies of
character; and I don't know how Sir, I have
a sort of presentiment that my wife has been
imposed upon. Perhaps I may be mistaken,
and God grant I may. But there was a je ne
sçai quoy in their behaviour to-day, which begins
to alarm my suspicion. Sir, I have nothing
but my reputation to depend upon; and
I hope you will excuse me, when I earnestly
beg to know what rank they maintain in life.” 
Fathom, without minding the consequence,
told him with a simper, that he knew them to
be very good natured ladies, who devoted
themselves to the happiness of mankind. This
explanation had no sooner escaped from his
lips, than the captain's face began to glow with
indignation, his eyes seemed bursting from
their spheres, he swelled to twice his natural
dimensions, and raising himself on his tiptoes, 

pronounced in a strain that emulated thunder,
“Blood! Sir, you seem to make very light of
the matter; but it is no joke to me, I'll assure
you: and Macleaver shall see that I am not to
be affronted with impunity. Sir, I shall take
it as a singular favour, if you will be the bearer
of a billet to him; which I shall write in three
words: nay, Sir, you must give me leave to
insist upon it, as you are the only gentleman of
our mess, whom I can intrust with an affair of
this nature.” 
Fathom, rather than run the risque of disobliging
such a punctilious warrior, after having
in vain attempted to dissuade him from
his purpose, undertook to carry the challenge,
which was immediately penned in these words. 

“Sir,
You have violated my honour, in imposing
upon Mrs Minikin, your pretended cousins,
as ladies of virtue and reputation; I
therefore demand such satisfaction as a soldier
ought to receive, and expect you will
adjust with my friend count Fathom, the
terms upon which you shall be met by the
much injured 
“Goliah Minikin.” 
This morçeau being sealed and directed,
was forthwith carried by our adventurer to the
lodgings of the major; who had by this time
retired to rest, but hearing the count's voice,
he got up and opened the door in cuerpo, to
the astonishment of Ferdinand, who had never
before seen such an Herculean figure. He
made an apology for receiving the count in his 

birth day suit, to which, he said, he was reduced
by the heat of his constitution, though he
might have assigned a more adequate cause, by
owning that his shirt was in the hands of his
washerwoman; then shrouding himself in a
blanket, desired to know what had procured
him the honour of such an extraordinary visit. 
He read the letter with great composure, like
a man accustomed to such intercourse; then
addressing himself to the bearer, “I will be
after diverting the gentleman, said he, in any
manner he shall think proper: but by Jesus!
this is no place for such amusements; because,
as you well know, my dear count, if both
should be killed by the chance of war, neither
of us will be able to escape, and after the
breath is out of his body, he will make but a
sorry excuse to his family and friends. But
that is no concern of mine, and therefore I am
ready to please him in his own way.” 
Fathom approved of his remarks, which he
reinforced with sundry considerations to the
same purpose, and begged the assistance of the
major's advice, in finding some expedient to
terminate the affair without bloodshed, that
no troublesome consequences might ensue either
to him or to his antagonist, who, in spite of
this over strained formality, seemed to be a
person of worth and good nature. “With
all my heart, said the generous Hibernian, I
have a great regard for the little man, and my
own character is not to seek at this time of
day. I have served a long apprenticeship to
fighting, as this same carcase can testify, and
if he compels me to run him through the 

body, by my shoul I shall do it in a friendly
manner.” 
So saying, he threw aside the blanket, and
displayed scars and seams innumerable upon his
body, which appeared like an old patched
leathern doublet. “I remember, proceeded
this champion, when I was a slave at Algiers,
Murphy Macmorris and I happened to have
some difference in the bagnio; upon which
he bad me turn out. Arra, for what? said I,
here are no weapons that a gentleman can use,
and you would not be such a negro as to box
like an English carman. After he had puzzled
himself for some time, he proposed that we
should retire into a corner, and funk at one
another with brimstone, till one of us should
give out. Accordingly we crammed half a
dozen of tobacco pipes with sulphur, and setting
foot to foot, began to smoke, and kept a
constant fire, until Macmorris dropped down; 
then I threw away my pipe, and taking poor
Murphy in my arms, “What are you dead,” 
said I, “if you are dead, speak.” “No, by
Jesus! cried he, I an't dead, but I'm speechless.” 
So he owned, I had obtained the victory,
and we were as good friends as ever. Now
if Mr. Minikin thinks proper to put the affair
upon the same issue, I will smoke a pipe of
brimstone with him to-morrow morning, and
if I cry out first, I will be after asking pardon
for this supposed affront.” 
Fathom could not help laughing at the proposal,
to which, however, he objected on account
of Minikin's delicate constitution, which
might suffer more detriment from breathing in
an atmosphere of sulphur, than from the discharge 

of a pistol, or the thrust of a small
sword. He therefore suggested another expedient
in lieu of the sulphur, namely, the gum
called Assa fœtida, which though abundantly
nauseous, could have no dangerous effect upon
the infirm texture of the lieutenant's lungs,
This hint being relished by the major, our adventurer
returned to his principal, and having
repeated the other's arguments against the use
of mortal instruments, described the succedaneum,
which he had concerted with Macleaver. 
The captain at first believed this scheme was
calculated for subjecting him to the ridicule of
his fellow prisoners, and began to storm with
great violence; but by the assurances and address
of Fathom, he was at length reconciled
to the plan, and preparations were made on
each side for this duel, which was actually
smoaked next day, about noon, in a small closet
detached from the challenger's apartment, and
within hearing of his majesty and all his court,
assembled as witnesses and umpires of the contest. 
The combatants being locked up together,
began to ply their engines with great fury, and
it was not long before captain Minikin perceived
he had a manifest advantage over his
antagonist. For his organs were familiarized
to the effluvia of this drug, which he had frequently
used in the course of an hypochondriac
disorder; whereas Macleaver, who was a stranger
to all sorts of medicine, by his wry faces
and attempts to puke, expressed the utmost
abhorrence of the smell that invaded his nostrils. 
Nevertheless, resolved to hold out to
the last extremity, he continued in action, untill 

the closet was filled with such an intolerable
vapour as discomposed the whole œconomy of
his intrails, and compelled him to disgorge his
breakfast in the face of his opponent, whose
nerves were so disconcerted by this disagreeable
and unforeseen discharge, that he fell back into
his chair in a swoon, and the major bellowed
aloud for assistance. The door being opened,
he ran directly to a window, to inhale the fresh
air, while the captain recovering from his fit,
complained of Macleaver's unfair proceedings,
and demanded justice of the arbitrators, who decided
in his favour; and the major being prevailed
upon to ask pardon for having introduced
Mrs Minikin to women of rotten reputation,
the parties were reconciled to each
other, and peace and concord re-established
in the mess. 
Fathom acquired universal applause for his
discreet and humane conduct upon this occasion; 
and that same afternoon had an opportunity
of seeing the lady in whose cause he
had exerted himself. He was presented to
her as the husband's particular friend, and
when she understood how much she was indebted
to his care and concern for the captain's
safety, she treated him with uncommon marks
of distinction; and he found her a genteel
well-bred woman, not without a good share of
personal charms, and a well cultivated understanding.
