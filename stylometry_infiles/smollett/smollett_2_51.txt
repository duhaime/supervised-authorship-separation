DEAR WATT,
WE made a precipitate retreat from Scarborough,
owing to the excess of delicacy of our
'squire, who cannot bear the thoughts of being
prætereuntium digito monstratus. 
One morning, while he was bathing in the sea,
his man Clinker took it in his head, that his master
was in danger of drowning; and, in this conceit,
plunging into the water, he lugged him out naked
on the beach, and almost pulled off his ear in the
operation. You may guess how this atchievement
was relished by Mr. Bramble, who is impatient, 

irascible, and has the most extravagant ideas of
decency and decorum in the œconomy of his own
person —In the first ebullition of his choler, he
knocked Clinker down with his fist; but he afterwards
made him amends for his outrage, and, in
order to avoid the further notice of the people,
among whom this incident had made him remarkable,
he resolved to leave Scarborough next day. 
We set out accordingly over the moors, by the
way of Whitby, and began our journey betimes,
in hopes of reaching Stockton that night; but in
this hope we were disappointed —In the afternoon,
crossing a deep gutter, made by atorrent, the
coach was so hard strained, that one of the irons,
which connect the frame, snapt, and the leather sling
on the same side, cracked in the middle —The
shock was so great, that my sister Liddy struck her
headagainst Mrs. Tabitha's nose with such violence
that the blood flowed: and Win. Jenkins was darted
through a small window, in that part of the carriage
next the horses, where she stuck like a bawd
in the pillory, till she was released by the hand of
Mr. Bramble. We were eight miles distant from
any place where we could be supplied with chaises,
and it was impossible to proceed with the coach,
until the damage should be repaired —In this dilemma,
we discovered a black-smith's forge on the
edge of a small common, about half a mile from
the scene of our disaster, and thither the postilions
made shift to draw the carriage slowly, while the
company walked a-foot; but we found the black-smith
had been dead some days; and his wife, who
had been lately delivered, was deprived of her
senses, under the care of a nurse, hired by the
parish. We were exceedingly mortified at this
disappointment, which, however, was surmounted
by the help of Humphry Clinker, who is a
surprising compound of genius and simplicity. 

Finding the tools of the defunct, together with
some coals in the smithy, he unscrewed the damaged
iron in a twinkling, and, kindling a fire,
united the broken pieces with equal dexterity and
dispatch —While he was at work upon this operation,
the poor woman in the straw, struck with the
well-known sound of the hammer and anvil, started
up, and, notwithstanding all the nurse's efforts,
came running into the smithy, where, throwing
her arms about Clinker's neck, “Ah, Jacob!
(cried she) how could you leave me in such a
condition?” 
This incident was too pathetic to occasion mirth
—it brought tears into the eyes of all present. 
The poor widow was put to bed again; and we did
not leave the village without doing something for
her benefit —Even Tabitha's charity was awakened
on this occasion. As for the tender-hearted
Humphry Clinker, he hammered the iron and wept
at the same time —But his ingenuity was not confined
to his own province of farrier and black-smith
—it was necessary to join the leather sling, which
had been broke; and this service he likewise performed,
by means of a broken awl, which he new-pointed
and ground, a little hemp, which he spun
into lingels, and a few tacks which he made for
the purpose —Upon the whole, we were in a condition
to proceed in a little more than one hour; 
but even this delay obliged us to pass the night at
Gisborough —Next day we crossed the Tees at
Stockton, which is a neat agreeable town; and there
we resolved to dine, with purpose to lie at Durham. 
Whom should we meet in the yard, when we alighted,
but Martin the adventurer? Having handed
out the ladies, and conducted them into an apartment,
where he payed his compliments to Mrs.
Tabby, with his usual address, he begged leave to
speak to my uncle in another room; and there, in 

some confusion, he made an apology for having
taken the liberty to trouble him with a letter at
Stevenage. He expressed his hope, that Mr. Bramble
had bestowed some consideration on his unhappy
case, and repeated his desire of being taken into
his service. 
My uncle, calling me into the room, told him,
that we were both very well inclined to rescue him
from a way of life that was equally dangerous and
dishonourable; and that he should have no scruples
in trusting to his gratitude and fidelity if he had
any employment for him, which he thought would
suit his qualifications and his circumstances; but
that all the departments he had mentioned in his
letter, were filled up by persons of whose conduct
he had no reason to complain; of consequence he
could not, without injustice, deprive any one of
them of his bread —Nevertheless, he declared
himself ready to assist him in any feasible project,
either with his purse or credit. 
Martin seemed deeply touched at this declaration 
—The tear started in his eye, while he said, in
a faultering accent —“Worthy sir—your generosity
oppresses me —I never dreamed of troubling
you for any pecuniary assistance—indeed I
have no occasion —I have been so lucky at billiards
and betting in different places, at Buxton
Harrigate, Scarborough, and Newcastle races,
that my stock in ready-money amounts to three
hundred pounds, which I would willingly employ,
in prosecuting some honest scheme of life; 
but my friend, justice Buzzard, has set so many
springs for my life, that I am under the necessity
of either retiring immediately to a remote part
of the country, where I can enjoy the protection
of some generous patron, or of quitting the
kingdom altogether —It is upon this alternative
that I now beg leave to ask your advice —I 

have had information of all your route, since I
had the honour to see you at Stevenage; and
supposing you would come this way from Scarborough,
I came hither last night from Darlington,
to pay you my respects.” 
“It would be no difficult matter to provide you
with an asylum in the country (replied my uncle;)
but a life of indolence and obscurity would
not suit with your active and enterprising disposition 
—I would therefore advise you to try
your fortune in the East Indies —I will give
you a letter to a friend in London, who will recommend
you to the direction, for a commission
in the company's service; and if that cannot
be obtained, you will at least be received as a
volunteer—in which case, you may pay for
your passage, and I shall undertake to procure
you such credentials, that you will not be long
without a commission.” 
Martin embraced the proposal with great eagerness; 
it was therefore resolved, that he should sell
his horse, and take a passage by sea for London, to
execute the project without delay —In the mean
time he accompanied us to Durham, where we
took up our quarters for that night —Here, being
furnished with letters from my uncle, he took his
leave of us, with strong symptoms of gratitude and
attachment, and set out for Sunderland, in order
to embark in the first collier, bound for the river
Thames. He had not been gone half an hour,
when we were joined by another character, which
promised something extraordinary —A tall, meager
figure, answering, with his horse, the description
of Don Quixote mounted on Rozinante,
appeared in the twilight at the inn door, while my
aunt and Liddy stood at a window in the dining-room 
—He wore a coat, the cloth of which had
once been scarlet, trimmed with Brandenburgs, 

not totally deprived of their metal, and he had
holster-caps and housing of the same stuff and
same antiquity. Perceiving ladies at the window
above he endeavoured to dismount with the most
graceful air he could assume; but the ostler neglecting
to hold the stirrup when he wheeled off his
right foot, and stood with his whole weight on the
other, the girth unfortunately gave way, the saddle
turned, down came the cavalier to the ground,
and his hat and periwig falling off, displayed a
head-piece of various colours, patched and plaistered
in a woeful condition —The ladies, at the
window above, shrieked with affright, on the supposition
that the stranger had received some notable
damage in his fall; but the greatest injury he
had sustained arose from the dishonour of his descent,
aggravated by the disgrace of exposing the
condition of his cranium; for certain plebeians that
were about the door, laughed aloud, in the belief
that the captain had got either a seald head, or a
broken head, both equaily opprobrious. 
He forthwith leaped up in a fury, and snatching
one of his pistols, threatened to put the ostler to
death, when another squall from the women
checked his resentment. He then bowed to the
window, while he kissed the butt-end of his pistol,
which he replaced; adjusting his wig in great confusion,
and led his horse into the stable —By this
time I had come to the door, and could not help
gazing at the strange figure that presented itself
to my view —He would have measured above six
feet in height, had he stood upright; but he stooped
very much; was very narrow in the shoulders,
and very thick in the calves of his legs, which
were cased in black spatterdashes —As for his
thighs, they were long and slender, like those of
a grasshopper; his face was, at least, half a yard
in length, brown and shrivelled, with projecting 

cheek-bones, little grey eyes on the greenish hue,
large hook-nose, a pointed chin, a mouth from ear
to ear, very ill furnished with teeth, and a high,
narrow fore-head, well furrowed with wrinkles. 
His horse was exactly in the stile of its rider; a
resurrection of dry bones, which (as we afterwards
learned) he valued exceedingly, as the only
present he had ever received in his life. 
Having seen this favourite steed properly accommodated
in the stable, he sent up his compliments
to the ladies, begging permission to thank them in
person for the marks of concern they had shewn at
his disaster in the court-yard —As the 'squire said
they could not decently decline his visit, he was
shewn up stairs, and paid his respects in the Scotch
dialect, with much formality —“Laddies, (said
he) perhaps ye may be scandaleezed at the appearance
my heed made, when it was uncovered
by accident; but I can assure you, the
condition you saw it in, is neither the effects
of disease, nor of drunkenness; but an honest
scar received in the service of my country.” 
He then gave us to understand, that having been
wounded at Ticonderoga, in America, a party of
Indians rifled him, scalped him, broke his scull
with the blow of a tomahawk, and left him for
dead on the field of battle; but that being afterwards
found with signs of life, he had been
cured in the French hospital, though the loss of
substance could not be repaired; so that the scull
was left naked in several places, and these he covered
with patches. 
There is no hold by which an Englishman is
sooner taken than that of compassion —We were
immediately interested in behalf of this veteran — 
Even Tabby's heart was melted; but our pity was
warmed with indignation, when we learned, that
in the course of two sanguinary wars, he had been 

wounded, maimed, mutilated, taken, and enslaved,
without ever having attained a higher rank than
that of lieutenant —My uncle's eyes gleamed, and
his nether lip quivered, while he exclaimed, “I
vow to God, sir, your case is a reproach to
the service —The injustice you have met with
is so flagrant—” “I must crave your pardon,
sir, (cried the other interrupting him) I complain
of no injustice —I purchased an ensigncy
thirty years ago; and, in the course of service,
rose to be a lieutenant, according to my seniority—” 
“But in such a length of time, (resumed
the 'squire) you must have seen a great
many young officers put over your head—” 
“Nevertheless, (said he) I have no cause to murmur 
—They bought their preferment with their
money —I had no money to carry to market— 
that was my misfortune; but nobody was to
blame—” “What! no friend to advance a sum
of money?” (said Mr. Bramble.) “Perhaps, I
might have borrowed money for the purchase
of a company (answered the other;) but that
loan must have been refunded; and I did not
choose to incumber myself with a debt of a thousand
pounds, to be payed from an income of ten
shillings a-day.” “So you have spent the best
part of your life, (cried Mr. Bramble) your
youth, your blood, and your constitution, amidst
the dangers, the difficulties, the horrors and
hardships of war, for the consideration of three
or four shillings a-day—a consideration—” 
“Sir, (replied the Scot, with great warmth) you
are the man that does me injustice, if you say
or think I have been actuated by any such paultry
consideration —I am a gentleman; and entered
the service as other gentlemen do, with
such hopes and sentiments as honourable ambition
inspires —If I have not been lucky in the 

lottery of life, so neither do I think myself unfortunate 
—I owe no man a farthing; I can always
command a clean shirt, a mutton-chop,
and a truss of straw; and when I die, I shall
leave effects sufficient to defray the expence of
my burial.” 
My uncle assured him, he had no intention to
give him the least offence, by the observations he
had made; but on the contrary, spoke from a sentiment
of friendly regard to his interest —The lieutenant
thanked him with a stiffness of civility, which
nettled our old gentleman, who perceived that his
moderation was all affected; for, whatsoever his
tongue might declare, his whole appearance denoted
dissatisfaction —In short without pretending
to judge of his military merit, I think I may affirm,
that this Caledonian is a self-conceited pedant,
aukward, rude, and disputacious —He has had the
benefit of a school-education, seems to have read
a good number of books, his memory is tenacious,
and he pretends to speak several different languages; 
but he is so addicted to wrangling, that he
will cavil at the clearest truths, and, in the pride
of argumentation, attempt to reconcile contradictions 
—Whether his address and qualifications are
really of that stamp which is agreeable to the taste
of our aunt, Mrs. Tabitha, or that indefatigable
maiden is determined to shoot at every sort of
game, certain it is she has begun to practise upon
the heart of the lieutenant, who favoured us with
his company to supper. 
I have many other things to say of this man of
war, which I shall communicate in a post or two; 
mean while, it is but reasonable that you should
be indulged with some respite from those weary
lucubrations of 
yours,
J. Melford.
