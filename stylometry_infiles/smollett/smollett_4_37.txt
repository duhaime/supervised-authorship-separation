Captain Whiffle sends for me—his situation
described—his surgeon arrives, prescribes
for him, and puts him to bed—a bed is put
up for Mr. Simper contiguous to the stateroom,
which, with other parts of the captain's
behaviour, gives the ship's company a
very unfavourable idea of their commander— 
I am detained in the West-Indies, by the
admiral, and go on board of the Lizard sloop
of war, in quality of surgeon's mate, where
I make myself known to the Surgeon, who
treats me very kindly—I go on shore,
sell my ticket, purchase necessaries, and at
my return on board, am surprized at the
sight of Crampley, who is appointed lieutenant
of the sloop—we sail on a
cruize—take a prize, in which I arrive
at Port Morant, under the command of
my mess mate, with whom I live in great
harmony. 
He was going on, with an elogium upon
the captain, when I received a message to
clean myself, and go up to the great cabbin, which
I immediately performed, sweetening myself with
rose-water from the medicine-chest. When
I entered the room, I was ordered to stand by 

the door, until captain Whiffle had reconnoitred
me at a distance, with a spy-glass, who having
consulted one sense in this manner, bid me advance
gradually, that his nose might have intelligence,
before it could be much offended: I therefore
approached with great caution and success,
and he was pleased to say, “Ay, this creature is
tolerable.” —I found him lolling on his couch
with a languishing air, his head supported by his
valet de chambre, who from time to time applied
a smelling-bottle to his nose. —“Vergette, (said
he, in a squeaking tone) dost thou think this
wretch (meaning me) will do me no injury?
may I venture to submit my arm to him?” 
—“Pon my vord, (replied the valet) I do tink
dat dere be great occasion for your honour
losing one small quantite of blodt; and the
yong mun ave qulque chose of de bonne mine. 
—“Well then (said his master) I think I must
venture.” —Then addressing himself to me,
“Hast thou ever blooded any body but brutes? 
—But I need not ask thee, for thou wilt tell
me a most damnable lie.” —“Brutes, Sir,
(answered I, pulling down his glove in order
to feel his pulse) I never meddle with brutes.” 
—“What the devil art thou about? (cried he)
dost thou intend to twist off my hand? Gad's
curse! my arm is benumbed up to the very
shoulder! Heaven have mercy upon me! must
I perish under the hands of savages? What an
unfortunate dog was I to come on board without
my own surgeon, Mr. Simper.” —I craved
pardon for having handled him so roughly, and
with the utmost care and tenderness tied up his
arm with a fillet of silk. While I was feeling 

for the vein, he desired to know how much blood
I intended to take from him, and when I answered,
“Not above twelve ounces;” started
up with a look full of horror, and bid me begone,
swearing I had a design upon his life. —Vergette
appeased him with some difficulty, and opening
a bureau, took out a pair of scales, in one of
which was placed a small cup; and putting them
into my hand, told me, the captain never lost above
an ounce and three drachms at one time. 
—While I prepared for this important evacuation,
there came into the cabbin, a young man,
gayly dressed, of a very delicate complexion, with
a kind of languid smile on his face, which seemed
to have been rendered habitual, by a long course
of affectation. —The captain no sooner perceived
him, than rising hastily, he flew into his arms,
crying, “O! my dear Simper! I am excessively
disordered! I have been betrayed, frighted,
murdered by the negligence of my servants,
who suffered a beast, a mule, a bear
to surprize me, and stink me into convulsions
with the fumes of tobacco.” —Simper, who
by this time, I found, was obliged to art for the
clearness of his complexion, assumed an air of
softness and sympathy, and lamented with many
tender expressions of sorrow, the sad accident that
had thrown him into that condition; then feeling
his patient's pulse on the outside of his glove, gave it
as his opinion, that his disorder was entirely nervous,
and that some drops of tincture of castor
and liquid  laudanum, would be of more service
to him than bleeding, by bridling the inordinate
sallies of his spirits, and composing the fermentation
of his bile proceeding therefrom. —I was 

therefore sent to prepare this prescription, which
was administred in a glass of sack-posset, after
the captain had been put to bed, and orders sent
to the officers on the quarter-deck, to let no body
walk on that side under which he lay. 
While the captain enjoyed his repose, the doctor
watched over him, and indeed became so necessary,
that a cabin was made for him contiguous
to the state-room, where Whiffle slept; that
he might be at hand in case of accidents in the
night. —Next day, our commander being happily
recovered, gave orders, that none of the lieutenants
should appear upon deck, without a wig,
sword, and ruffles; nor any midshipman, or other
petty officer, be seen with a check shirt or
dirty linen. —He also prohibited any person whatever,
except Simper and his own servants, from
coming into the great cabbin, without first sending
in to obtain leave. —These singular regulations
did not prepossess the ship's company in his favour; 
but on the contrary, gave scandal an opportunity
to be very busy with his character, and
accuse him of maintaining a correspondence with
his surgeon, not fit to be named. 
In a few weeks, our ship was under sailing
orders, and I was in hopes of re-visiting my native
country in a very short time, when the admiral's
surgeon came on board, and sending for
Morgan and me to the quarter-deck, gave me to
understand, there was a great scarcity of surgeons
in the West-Indies, that he was commanded to
detain one mate out of every great ship that
was bound for England; and desired us to agree
among ourselves, before the next day at that
hour, which of us should stay behind. —We 

were thunder-struck at this proposal, and stared
at one another some time, without speaking; at
length the Welchman broke silence, and offered
to remain in the West-Indies, provided the admiral
would give him a surgeon's warrant immediately: 
But he was told there was no want of
chief surgeons, and that he must be contented
with the station of mate, till he should be further
provided for in due course: Whereupon Morgan
flatly refused to quit the ship for which the commissioners
of the navy had appointed him; and
the other told him as plainly, that if we could
not determine the affair by ourselves before tomorrow
morning, he must cast lots, and abide
by his chance. —When I recalled to my remembrance
the miseries I had undergone in England,
where I had not one friend to promote my interest,
or favour my advancement in the navy, and
at the same time, reflected on the present dearth
of surgeons in the West-Indies, and the unhealthiness
of the climate, which every day, almost,
reduced the number, I could not help
thinking my success would be much more certain
and expeditious, by staying where I was,
than by returning to Europe. —I therefore resolved
to comply with a good grace, and next
day, when we were ordered to throw dice,
told Morgan, he needed not trouble himself, for
I would voluntarily submit to the admiral's pleasure. 
—This frank declaration was commended by
the gentleman, who assured me, if should not fare
the worse with me for my resignation: Indeed
he was as good as his word, and that very afternoon,
procured a warrant, appointing me surgeon's
mate of the Lizzard sloop of war, which 

put me on a footing with every first mate in the
service. 
My ticket being made out, I put my chest
and bedding on board a canoe that was along-side,
and having shook hands with my trusty
friend the serjeant, and honest Jack Rattlin, who
was bound for Greenwich-hospital, I took my
leave of Morgan with many tears, after we had
exchanged our sleeve-buttons as remembrances of
each other. —Having presented my new warrant
to the captain of the Lizard, I enquired for the
doctor, whom I no sooner saw, than I recollected
him to be one of those young fellows with whom
I had been committed to the round-house, during
our frolick with Jackson, as I have related before. 
—He received me with a good deal of courtesy,
and when I put him in mind of our former
acquaintance, expressed great joy in seeing me again,
and recommended me to an exceeding good
mess, composed of the gunner and the master's
mate. —As there was not one sick person in the
ship, I got leave to go ashore, next day, with the
gunner, who recommended me to a Jew, that
bought my ticket, at the rate of 40 per cent.
discount; and having furnished myself with what
necessaries I wanted, returned on board in the
evening, and to my great surprize, found my old
antagonist Crampley walking upon deck. —Tho'
I did not fear his enmity, I was shocked at his
appearance, and communicated my sentiments on
that subject to Mr. Tomlins the surgeon, who
told me, that Crampley, by the dint of some friends
about the admiral, had procured a commission
constituting him lieutenant on board the Lizzard:
and advised me, now he was my superior officer, 

to behave with some respect towards him, or else
he would find a thousand opportunities of using me
ill. —This advice was a bitter potion to me,
whom pride and resentment had rendered utterly
incapable of the least submission to, or even of
reconciliation with the wretch, who had, on many
occasions, treated me so inhumanly: However, I
resolved to have as little connexion as possible
with him, and to ingratiate myself as much as
I could with the rest of the officers, whose friendship
might be a bulwark to defend me from the
attempts of his malice. 
In less than a week we sailed on a cruize, and
having got round the east end of the island, had
the good fortune to take a Spanish Barcolongo,
with her prize, which was an English ship bound
for Bristol, that sailed from Jamaica a fortnight
before, without convoy. All the prisoners who
were well, were put on shore on the north-side of
the island; the prizes were manned with Englishmen,
and the command of the Barcolonge,
given to my friend the master's mate, with orders
to carry them into Port Morant, and there
to remain until the Lizzard's cruize should be ended,
at which time she would touch at the same
place in her way to Port-Royal. —With him I
was sent to attend the wounded Spaniards as well
as Englishmen, who amounted to sixteen, and to
take care of them on shore, in a house that was
to be hired as an hospital. —This destination gave
me a great deal of pleasure, as I would, for some
time, be freed from the arrogance of Crampley,
whose inveteracy against me had already broke
out on two or three occasions, since he was become
a lieutenant. —My mess-mate, who very 

much resembled my uncle, both in figure and
disposition, treated me on board of the prize,
with the utmost civility and confidence; and among
other favours, made me a present of a silver
hilted hanger, and a pair of pistols mounted with
the same metal, which fell to his share in plundering
the enemy. —We arrived safely at Morant,
and going ashore, pitched upon an empty
store-house, which we hired for the reception of
the wounded, who were brought to it next day,
with beds and other necessaries; and four of the
ship's company appointed to attend them, and
obey me.
