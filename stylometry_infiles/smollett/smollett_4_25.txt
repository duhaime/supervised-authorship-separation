She is interrupted by a bailif, who arrests,
and carries her to the Marshalsea—I
accompany her—bring witnesses to prove
she is not the same person named in the
writ—the bailif is fain to give her a
present, and discharge her—we shift our
lodging—she resumes her story and ends
it—my reflections thereupon—she makes
me acquainted with the progress of a common
woman of the town—resolves to quit
that way of life. 
Her story was here interrupted by a rap at
the door, which I no sooner opened, than
three or four terrible fellows rushed in, one of
whom accosted my fellow lodger thus: — 
“Madam, your servant—you must do me the
favour to come along with me—I have got a
writ against you.” —While the bailif (for so
he was) spoke thus, his followers surrounded the
prisoner, and began to handle her very roughly. 
—This treatment incensed me so much, that I
snatched up the poker, and would certainly have
used it in defence of the lady, without any regard
to the strength and number of her adversaries,
had not she begged me with a composure of
countenance, for which I could not account, to
use no violence in her behalf, which could be of
no service to her, but might be very detrimental 

to myself. —Then turning to the leader of this
formidable troop, she desired to see the warrant,
and having perused it, said with a faultering voice,
“I am not the person whose name is here mentioned; 
arrest me at your peril.” —“Ay, ay,
Madam, (replied the catch-pole) we shall prove
your identity. —In the mean time, whether
will you be pleased to be carried to my house or
to Jail?” —“If I must be confined (said
she) I would rather have your house for a prison
than a common Jail.” —“Well, well,
(answered he) if you have money enough in
your pocket, you shall be entertained like a
princess.” —But when she acquainted him
with her poverty, he swore he never gave credit,
and ordered one of his myrmidons to call a coach
to carry her to the Marshalsea at once. —While
this was a doing she took me aside, and bid me
be under no concern on her account, for she
knew how to extricate herself from this difficulty
very soon, and perhaps gain something by the
occasion. —Although her discourse was a mystery
to me, I was very well pleased with her assurance,
and when the coach came to the door, offered
to accompany her to prison, to which, after
much intreaty, she consented. —When we arrived
at the gate of the Marshalsea, our conductor alighted,
and having demanded entrance, presented
the writ to the turnkey, who no sooner perceived
the name of Elizabeth Cary, than he cried,
“Ah ha! my old acquaintance Bett! I'm glad
to see thee with all my heart.” —So saying he
opened the coach door, and helped her to dismount; 
but when he observed her face, he started
back, saying, “Z&wblank;ds! who have we got
here?” —The bailif, alarmed at this interrogation, 

cried with some emotion, “Who the
devil should it be, but the prisoner Elizabeth
Cary?” The turnkey replied, “That Elizabeth
Cary! —I'll be damned if that's Elizabeth
Cary, more than my grandmother. — 
D&wblank;n my blood, I know Bett Cary as well
as if I had made her.” —Here the lady
thought fit to interpose, and tell the catchpole,
if he had taken her word for it at first, he might
have saved himself and her a great deal of trouble. 
—“It may be so (answered he) but by G&sblank;d,
I'll have further evidence that you are not the
person before you and I part.” —“Yes, yes,
(said she) you shall have further evidence to
your cost.” —Upon this we adjourned into the
lodge, and called for a bottle of wine, where my
companion wrote a direction to two of her
acquaintance, and begged the favour of me to
go to their lodgings, and request them to come to
her immediately: I found them together at a house
in Bridges's street, Drury-lane, and as they were
luckily unengaged, they set out with me in a hackney-coach
without hesitation, after I had related
the circumstances of the affair, which flattered
them with hopes of seeing a bailif trounced; for
there is an antipathy as natural between the
whores and bailifs, as that subsisting between mice
and cats. —Accordingly, when they entered the
lodge, they embraced the prisoner very affectionately
by the name of Nancy Williams; and
asked how long she had been nabb'd, and for
what? —On hearing the particulars of her adventure
repeated, they offered to swear before a
justice of peace that she was not the person mentioned
in the writ, whom, it seems, they all
knew; but the bailif, who by this time was
convinced of his mistake, told them he would not 

put them to that trouble. —“Ladies (said he)
there's no harm done—you shall give me leave
to treat you with another bottle, and then
we'll part friends.” —This proposal was not at
all relished by the sisterhood; and miss Williams
told him: Sure he did not imagine her such a
fool as to be satisfied with a paultry glass of sour
wine. —Here the turnkey interrupted her, by
affirming with an oath, that the wine was as good
as ever was tipped over tongue. —“Well (continued
she) that may be—but was it the best
of champaign, it is no recompence for the damage
I have suffered both in character and
health, by being wrongfully dragged to jail— 
At this rate no innocent person is safe, since
any officer of justice, out of malice, private
pique, or mistake, may injure and oppress the
subject with impunity—but, thank heaven, I
live under the protection of laws that will not
suffer such insults to pass unpunished, and I
know very well how to procure redress.” — 
Mr. Vulture (for that was the bailif's name)
finding he had to deal with one who would not
be imposed upon, began to look very sullen and
perplexed, and leaning his fore-head on his hand,
entered into a deliberation with himself, which
lasted a few minutes, and then broke out in a
volley of dreadful curses against the old b&wblank;ch
our landlady (as he called her) for having misinformed
him. —After much wrangling and swearing,
the matter was referred to the decision of
the turnkey, who calling for the other bottle,
mulcted the bailif in all the liquor that had been
drank, coach-hire, and a couple of guineas for
the use of the plaintif. —The money was immediately
deposited; miss Williams gratified the two 

evidences with one half, and putting the other
in her pocket drove home with me, leaving the
catchpole grumbling over his loss, yet pleased in
the main, for having so cheaply got clear of a business
that might have cost him ten times the
sum, and his place to boot. —This guinea was
a very seasonable relief to us, who were reduced
to great necessity, six of my shirts and almost all
my cloaths, except those on my back, being either
pawned or sold for our maintenance before this
happened. —As we resented the behaviour of our
landlandy, our first care was to provide ourselves
with another lodging, whither we removed next
day, with an intention to keep ourselves as retired
as possible until our cure should be compleated. 
—When we were fixed in our new habitation,
I intreated her to finish the story of her Life,
which she pursued in this manner: 
The success of our experiment on the J&wblank;ge,
encouraged us to practice the same deceit on others,
and my virginity was five times sold to
good purpose; but this harvest lasted not long,
my character taking air, and my directress deserting
me for some new game. Whereupon I
took lodgings near Charing cross, at two guineas
per week, and began to entertain company in a
public manner: —But my income being too small
to defray my expence, I was obliged to retrench,
and enter into articles with the porters of certain
taverns, who undertook to find employment enough
for me, provided I would share my profits with
them. —Accordingly, I was almost every night
engaged with company, among whom I was exposed
to every mortification, danger and abuse
that flow from drunkenness, brutality and disease. 

—How miserable is the condition of a courtezan,
whose business it is to sooth, suffer, and obey the
dictates of rage, insolence and lust! —As my spirit
was not sufficiently humbled to the will, nor
my temper calculated for the conversation of my
gallants, it was impossible for me to overcome
an aversion I felt for my profession, which manifested
itself in a settled gloom on my countenance,
and disgusted these sons of mirth and riot so much,
that I was frequently used in a shocking manner,
and kicked down stairs with disgrace. —The messengers
seeing me disagreeable to their benefactors
and employers, seldom troubled me with a call,
and I began to find myself almost totally neglected. 
To contribute towards my support, I was fain to
sell my watch, rings, trinkets, with the best part of
my cloaths; and I was one evening musing by
myself, on the misery before me, when I received
a message from a bagnio, whither I repaired
in a chair, and was introduced to a gentleman
dressed like an officer, with whom I supped tête
a tête, in a sumptuous manner, and after drinking
a hearty glass of champaign, went to
bed. —In the morning when I awoke I found
my gallant had got up, and drawing aside
the curtain, could not perceive him in the
room; this gave me some uneasiness, but as
he might have retired on some necessary occasion,
I waited a full hour for his return; 
and then in the greatest perplexity got up, and
rung the bell. —When the waiter came to the
door, he found it locked, and desired admittance,
which I granted, after observing with great surprize
that the key remained on the inside, as
when we went to bed. —I no sooner enquired for
the captain, than the fellow staring with a distracted 

look, cried, “How, madam! is he not
a-bed?” And when he was satisfied as to that,
run into a closet adjoining to the chamber, the
window of which he found open. —Through this
the adventurer had got upon a wall, from whence
he dropped down into a court and escaped; leaving
me to be answerable, not only for the reckoning,
but also for a large silver tankard and
posset-bowl, which he had carried off with him. 
—It is impossible to describe the consternation I
was under, when I saw myself detained as a thief's
accomplice (for I was looked upon in that light)
and carried before a justice, who mistaking my
confusion for a sign of guilt, committed me after
a short examination to Bridewell, having advised
me, as the only means to save my life, to turn
evidence, and impeach my confederate. —I now
concluded, the vengeance of heaven had overtaken
me, and that I must soon finish my carreer
by an ignominious death. —This reflection sunk
so deep into my soul, that I was for some days
deprived of my reason, and actually believed myself
in hell, tormented by fiends: Indeed, there
needs not a very extravagant imagination to form
that conjecture; for of all the scenes on earth,
that of Bridewell approaches nearest the idea I
had always entertained of the infernal regions. 
—Here I saw nothing but rage, anguish and impiety; 
and heard nothing but groans, curses and
blasphemy. —In the midst of this hellish crew, I
was subjected to the tyranny of a barbarian, who
imposed upon me tasks that I could not possibly
perform, and then punished my incapacity with
the utmost rigour and inhumanity. I was often
whipt into a swoon, and lashed out of it, during
which miserable intervals, I was robbed by my 

fellow-prisoners of every thing about me, even
to my cape, shoes and stockings: I was not only
destitute of necessaries, but even of food, so that
my wretchedness was extreme. Not one of my
acquaintance to whom I imparted my situation,
would grant me the least succour or regard, on
pretence of my being committed for theft; and my
landlord refused to part with some of my own
cloaths which I sent for, because I was indebted
to him for a week's lodging. —Overwhelmed with
calamity, I grew desperate, and resolved to put
an end to my grievances and life together; for
this purpose I got up in the middle of the night,
when I thought every body round me asleep,
and fixing one end of my handkerchief to a large
hook in the ceiling, that supported the scales on
which the hemp is weighed, I stood upon a chair
and making a noose on the other end, put my
neck into it, with an intention to hang myself,
but before I could adjust the knot, I was surprised
and prevented by two women who had been
awake all the while, and suspected my design. — 
In the morning my attempt was published among
the prisoners, and punished with thirty stripes,
the pain of which co-operating with my disappointment
and disgrace, bereft me of my senses
and threw me into an extasy of madness, wherein
I tore the flesh from my bones with my teeth,
and dashed my head against the pavement. —So
that they were obliged to set a watch over me, to
restrain me from doing further mischief to myself
and others. —This fit of phrenzy continued three
days, at the end of which I grew calm and sullen; 
but as the desire of making away with myself still remained,
I came to a determination of starving myself
to death, and with that view refused all sustenance. 

Whether it was owing to the want of opposition,
or to the weakness of nature, I know not, but
on the second day of my fast, I found my resolution
considerably impaired, and the calls of
hunger almost insupportable. —At this critical
conjuncture a lady was brought into the prison,
with whom I had contracted an acquaintance
while I lived with Horatio; she was then on the
same footing as I was, but afterwards quarreling
with her gallant, and not finding another to her
mind, altered her scheme of life, and set up a
coffee-house among the hundreds of Drury,
where she entertained gentlemen with claret, arrack
and the choice of half a dozen damsels,
who lived in her house. This serviceable matron,
having neglected to gratify a certain j&wblank;ce
for the connivance she enjoyed, was indicted at
the quarter sessions, in consequence of which
her bevy was dispersed and herself committed to
Bridewell. —She had not been long there, before
she learned my disaster, and coming up to me,
after a compliment of condolance, enquired into
the particulars of my fate: While we were engaged
in discourse together, the master coming up,
told me that the fellow on whose account I had
suffered was taken, that he had confessed the
theft, and cleared me of any concern in the affair; 
for which reason he, the master, had orders
to discharge me, and that I was from that moment
free. This piece of news soon banished
all thoughts of death, and had such an instantaneous
effect on my countenance, that Mrs.
Coupler (the lady then present) hoping to find
her account in me, very generously offered to
furnish me with what necessaries I wanted, and
take me into her own house, as soon as she could 

compromise matters with the j&wblank;ces. —The conditions
of her offer, were, that I should pay
three guineas weekly for my board, and a reasonable
consideration besides for the use of such
cloaths and ornaments as she should supply me
with, to be deducted from the first profits of my
embraces. —These were hard terms; but not be
rejected by one who was turned out helpless and
naked into the wide world, without a friend to
pity or assist her. —I therefore embraced her
proposal, and she being bailed in a few hours,
took me home with her in a coach. As I was
by this time conscious of having formerly disgusted
my admirers by my reserved and haughty
behaviour, I now endeavoured to conquer that
disposition, and the sudden change of my fortune
giving me a flow of spirits, I appeared in the
most winning and gay manner I could assume. 
Having the advantage of a good voice and education
over most of my rivals, I exerted my talents
to the uttermost, and soon became the favourite
with all company. —This success alarmed
the pride and jealousy of Mrs. Coupler, who
could not bear the thoughts of being eclipsed: 
She therefore made a merit of her envy, and
whispered about among her customers that I was
unsound. —There needed no more to ruin my reputation
and blast my prosperity; every body
shunned me with marks of aversion and disdain,
and in a very short time I was as solitary as ever. 
Want of gallants was attended with want of
money to satisfy my malicious landlady, who
having purposely given me credit to the amount
of eleven pounds, took out a writ against me,
and I was arrested in her own house. —Though the
room was crouded with people, when the bailif 

entered, not one of them had compassion enough
to attempt to molify my prosecutrix, far less to pay
the debt; they even laughed at my tears, and one
of them bid me be of good cheer, for I should
not want admirers in Newgate. At that instant
a sea lieutenant came in, and seeing my plight,
began to enquire into the circumstances of my
misfortune, when this wit advised him to keep
clear of me, for I was a fire-ship. —“A fire-ship!
(replied the sailor) more like a poor galley in
distress that has been boarded by such a fire-ship
as you; if so be that be the case, she stands in
more need of assistance. —Harkee, my girl,
how far have you over-run the constable?” — 
I told him that the debt amounted to eleven
pounds, besides the expence of the writ. —“An
that be all (said he) you shan't go to the bilboes
this bout.” —And taking out his purse,
paid the money, discharged the bailif, and telling
me, I had got into the wrong port, advised me
to seek out a more convenient harbour, where I
could be safely hove down, for which purpose he
made me a present of five guineas more. —I was
so touched with this singular piece of generosity,
that for some time I had not power to thank him. 
—However, as soon as I had recollected myself,
I begged the favour of him to go with me
to the next tavern, where I explained the nature
of my disaster, and convinced him of the falsehood
of what was reported to my prejudice so
effectually, that he from that moment attached
himself to me, and we lived in great harmony
together, until he was obliged to go to sea, where
he perished in a storm. 
Having lost my benefactor, and almost consumed
the remains of his bounty, I saw myself 

in danger of relapsing into my former necessity,
and began to be very uneasy at the prospect of
bailifs and jails;—when one of the sisterhood, a
little stale, advised me to take lodgings in a part
of the town where I was unknown, and pass
for an heiress, which might entrap some body to
be my husband, who would possibly be able to
allow me an handsome maintenance, or at worst
screen me from the dread and danger of a prison,
by becoming liable for whatever debts I should
contract. —I approved of this scheme, towards
the execution of which my companion clubbed
her wardrobe, and undertook to live with me in
quality of my maid; with the proviso, that she
should be reimbursed and handsomely considered
out of the profits of my success. —She was immediately
detached to look out for a convenient place,
and that very day hired a genteel apartment in
Park-street, whither I moved in a coach loaded
with her baggage and my own. —I made my first
appearance in a blue riding-habit trimmed with
silver; and my maid acted her part so artfully,
that in a day or two, my fame was spread all over
the neighbourhood, and I was said to be a rich
heiress just arrived from the country. —This report
brought a swarm of gay young fellows about
me; but I soon found them out to be all indigent
adventurers like myself, who crouded to me like
crows to a carrion, with a view of preying upon
my fortune. —I maintained, however, the appearance
of wealth as long as possible, in hopes of
gaining some admirer more for my purpose; and
at length, I attracted the regard of one who
would have satisfied my wishes, and managed
matters so well, that a day was actually fixed for
our nuptials: In the interim, he begged leave to 

introduce an intimate friend to me, which request
as I could not refuse, I had the extreme mortification
and surprize, to see next night, in that
friend, my old keeper Horatio, who no sooner
beheld me than he changed colour; but had presence
of mind enough to advance and salute me,
bidding me (with a low voice) be under no apprehension,
for he would not expose me. —In spite of
this assurance, I could not recover myself so far,
as to entertain them, but withdrew to my chamber
on pretence of a severe head-ach, to the no small
concern of my adorer, who took his leave in the
tenderest manner, and went off with his friend. 
Having imparted my situation to my companion,
she found it high time for us to decamp, and that
without any noise, because we were not only indebted
to our landlady, but also to several tradesmen
in the neighbourhood. —Our retreat (therefore)
was concerted and executed in this manner: Having
packed up all our cloaths and moveables in
small parcels, she (on pretence of fetching cordials
for me) carried them at several times, to the
house of an acquaintance, where she likewise procured
a lodging, to which we retired, in the
middle of the night, opening the street door,
when every other body in the house was asleep. — 
I was now obliged to aim at lower game, and accordingly
spread my nets among trades people; 
but found them all too phlegmatic or cautious for
my art and attractions; till at last I became acquainted
with you, on whom I practised all my
dexterity; not that I believed you had any fortune
or expectation of one, but that I might
transfer the burthen of such debts as I had incurred
or could contract, from myself to another, and
at the same time, avenge myself of your sex, by 

rendering miserable, one who bore such resemblance
to the wretch who ruined me;—but heaven
preserved you from my snares, by the discovery
you made, which was owing to the negligence
of my maid in leaving the chamber-door
unlocked, when she went to buy sugar for breakfast. 
—The person in bed with me, was a gentleman
whom I had allured the night before, as he
walked homeward pretty much elevated with liquor; 
for by this time, my condition was so low,
that I was forced to turn out, in the twilight, to
the streets in hopes of prey. —When I found myself
detected and forsaken by you, I was fain to
move my lodging and dwell two pair of stairs
higher than before: My companion being disappointed
in her expectations, left me, to trade upon
her own bottom, and I had no other resource,
than to venture forth like the owls, in the dark, to
pick up a precarious and uncomfortable subsistence. 
I have often sauntered between Ludgate-hill and
Charing-cross, a whole winter-night, exposed not
only to the inclemency of the weather, but likewise
to the rage of hunger and thirst, without being
so happy as to meet with one cully; then creep up
to my garret in a deplorable, draggled condition,
sneak to bed, and try to bury my appetite and
sorrows in sleep. —When I lighted on some rake
or tradesman reeling home drunk, I frequently
suffered the most brutal treatment, in spite of
which I was obliged to affect gaiety and good
humour, tho' my soul was stung with resentment
and disdain, and my heart loaded with grief
and affliction. —In the course of these nocturnal
adventures, I was infected with the disease, that
in a short time render'd me the object of my own
abhorrence, and drove me to the retreat, where 

your benevolence rescued me from the jaws of
death. 
So much candour and good sense appeared in
this lady's narration, that I made no scruple
of believing every syllable of what she said; and
expressed my astonishment at the variety of miseries
she had undergone, in so little time; for all
her misfortunes had happened within the compass
of two years. —I compared her situation with my
own, and found it a thousand times more wretched: 
I had endured hardships, 'tis true; my whole
life had been a series of such, and when I looked
forward, the prospect was not much bettered— 
but then, they were become habitual to me, and
consequently, I could bear them with less difficulty
—If one scheme of life should not succeed, I could
have recourse to another, and so to a third, veering
about to a thousand different shifts, according to
the emergencies of my fate, without forfeiting the
dignity of my character, beyond a power of retrieving
it, or subjecting myself wholly to the caprice
and barbarity of the world. On the other
hand, she had known and relished the sweets of
prosperity, she had been brought up under the
wings of an indulgent parent, in all the delicacies
to which her sex and rank entitled her; and
without any extravagance of hope, entertained
herself with the view of uninterrupted happiness
thro' the whole scene of life—How fatal then,
how tormenting, how intolerable must her reverse
of fortune be! a reverse, that not only robbs
her of these external comforts, and plunges her
into all the miseries of want, but also murthers
her peace of mind, and entails upon her the curse
of eternal infamy! —Of all professions I pronounced 

that of a courtezan the most deplorable,
and her of all courtezans the most unhappy. —She
allowed my observation to be just in the main,
but at the same time, affirmed, that notwithstanding
the disgraces which had fallen to her share,
she had not been so unlucky in the condition of a
prostitute as many others of the same community. 
—“I have often seen (said she) while I strolled
about the streets at mid-night, a number of
naked wretches reduced to rags and filth, huddled
together like swine, in the corner of a dark
alley; some of whom, but eighteen months
before, I had known the favourites of the town,
rolling in affluence, and glittering in all the
pomp of equipage and dress.” —And indeed the
gradation is easily conceived; the most fashionable
woman of the town is as liable to contagion, as
one in a much humbler sphere; she infects her
admirers, her situation is publick, she is avoided,
neglected, unable to support her usual appearance,
which however she strives to maintain as long as
possible; her credit fails, she is obliged to retrench
and become a night-walker, her malady gains
ground, she tampers with her constitution and
ruins it; her complexion fades, she grows nauseous
to every body, finds herself reduced to a starving
condition, is tempted to pick pockets, is detected,
committed to Newgate, where she remains
in a miserable condition, 'till she is discharged
because the plaintiff appears not to prosecute
her. No body will afford her lodging, the
symptoms of her distemper are grown outrageous,
she sues to be admitted into an hospital, where she
is cured at the expence of her nose; she is turned
out naked into the streets, depends upon the addresses
of the canaille, is fain to allay the rage of 

hunger and cold with gin, degenerates into a state
of brutal insensibility, rots and dies upon a dunghill. 
—Miserable wretch that I am! perhaps the
same horrors are decreed for me! —“No (cried
she after some pause) I shall never live to such
extremity of distress! my own hand shall open
away for my deliverance, before I arrive at that
forlorn period!” —Her condition filled me
with sympathy and compassion; I revered her qualifications,
looked upon her as unfortunate, not
criminal; and attended her with such care and success,
that in less than two months, her health, as
well as my own, was perfectly re-established. — 
As we often conferred upon our mutual affairs, and
interchanged advice; a thousand different projects
were formed, which upon further canvassing appeared
impracticable. —We would have gladly
gone to service; but who would take us in without
recommendation? At length an expedient occurred
to her, of which she intended to lay hold; and
this was, to procure with the first money she
should earn, the homely garb of a country wench,
go to some village at a good distance from town,
and come up in a waggon, as a fresh girl for service; 
by which means, she might be provided for
in a manner much more suitable to her inclination,
than her present way of life.
