He is initiated in a military life, and has the
good fortune to acquire a generous patron. 
While she wearied Heaven with these petitions,
the flame of war broke out betwixt
the houses of Ottoman and Austria, and
the emperor sent forth an army into Hungary,
under the auspices of the renowned prince Eugene. 
On account of this expedition, the mother
of our hero gave up house-keeping, and
chearfully followed her customers and husband
into the field; having first provided herself
with store of those commodities, in which she
had formerly merchandized. Altho' the hope
of profit might in some measure affect her determination,
one of the chief motives for her
visiting the frontiers of Turkey, was the desire
of initiating her son in the rudiments of his
education, which she now thought high time
to inculcate; he being, at this period, in
the sixth year of his age; he was accordingly,
conducted to the camp, which she considered
as the most consummate school of life, and
proposed for the scene of his instruction; and
in this academy he had not continued many
weeks, when he was an eye-witness of that famous
victory, which, with sixty thousand men, 

the imperial general obtained over an army of
one hundred and fifty thousand Turks. 
His father-in-law was engaged, and his mother
would not be idle on this occasion: she
was a perfect mistress of all the camp qualifications,
and thought it a duty incumbent on her,
to contribute all that lay in her power, towards
distressing the enemy: with these sentiments,
she hovered about the skirts of the army, and
the troops were no sooner employed in the
pursuit, than she began to transverse the field
of battle with a poignard and a bag, in order
to consult her own interest, annoy the foe, and
exercise her humanity at the same time. In
short, she had, with amazing prowess, delivered
some fifty or threescore disabled mussulmen of
the pain under which they groaned, and made
a comfortable booty of the spoils of the slain,
when her eyes were attracted by the rich attire
of an imperial officer, who lay bleeding on
the plain, to all appearance in the agonies of
death. 
She could not, in her heart, refuse that favour
to a friend and christian, she had so compassionately
bestowed upon so many enemies
and infidels, and therefore drew near with the
sovereign remedy, which she had already administred
with such success. As she approached
this deplorable object of pity, her ears were
surprized with an ejaculation in the English
tongue, which he fervently pronounced, tho'
with a weak and languid voice, recommending
his soul to God, and his family to the protection
of Heaven. Our amazon's purpose was
staggered by this providential incident; the
sound of her native language, so unexpectedly 

heard, and so pathetically delivered, had a surprising
effect upon her imagination; and the
faculty of reflection did not forsake her in such
emergency: though she could not recollect the
features of this unhappy officer, she concluded
from his appearance, that he was some person
of distinction in the service, and foresaw greater
advantage to herself in attempting to preserve
his life, than she could possibly reap from
the execution of her first resolve. “If (said
she to herself) I can find means of conveying
him to his tent, alive, he cannot but in conscience
acknowledge my humanity with some
considerable recompence; and should he chance
to survive his wounds, I have every thing to
expect from his gratitude and power.” 
Fraught with these prudential suggestions,
she drew near the unfortunate stranger, and in
a softened accent of pity and condolance, questioned
him concerning his name, condition,
and the nature of his mischance, at the same
time making a gentle tender of her service. Agreeably
surprised to hear himself accosted in
such a manner, by a person whose equipage
seemed to promise far other designs, he thanked
her in the most gratefull terms for her humanity,
with the appellation of kind countrywoman; 
gave her to understand that he was collonel
of a regiment of horse; that he had fallen
in consequence of a shot he received in
his breast, at the beginning of the action; and
finally intreated her to procure some carriage
on which he might be removed to his tent. 
Perceiving him faint and exhausted with loss
of blood, she raised up his head, and treated
him with that cordial which was her constant 

companion: at that instant, espying a small
body of hussars returning to the camp with the
plunder they had taken, she invoked their assistance,
and they forthwith carried the officer
to his own quarters, where his wound was
dressed, and his preserver carefully tended him
until his recovery was compleated. 
In return for these good offices, this gentleman,
who was originally of Scotland, rewarded
her for the present, with great liberality,
assured her of his influence in promoting her
husband, and took upon himself the charge of
young Ferdinand's education; the boy was immediately
taken into his protection, and entered
as a trooper in his own regiment; but his
good intentions towards his father-in-law, were
frustrated by the death of the German, who
in a few days after this disposition, was shot
in the trenches before Temiswaer. 
This event, over and above the conjugal affliction
with which it invaded the lady's quiet,
would have involved her in infinite difficulty
and distress, with regard to her temporal concerns,
by leaving her unprotected in the midst
of strangers, had not she been thus providentially
supplied, with an effectual patron in the
colonel, who was known by the appellation of
count Melvil. He no sooner saw her, by the
death of her husband, detached from all personal
connections with a military life, than he
proposed that she should quit her occupation
in the camp, and retire to his habitation in
the city of Presburgh, where she would be entertained
in ease and plenty, during the remaining
part of her natural life: with all due
acknowledgements of his generosity, she begged 

to be excused from embracing his proposal,
alledging she was so much accustomed to her
present way of life, and so much devoted to
the service of the soldiery, that she should never
be happy in retirement, while the troops of
any prince of Christendom kept the field. 
The count finding her determined to prosecute
her scheme, repeated his promise of befriending
her upon all occasions; and in the
mean time, admitted Ferdinand into the number
of his domestics, resolving that he should
be brought up in attendance upon his own son,
who was a boy of the same age. He kept him
however, in his tent, until he should have an
opportunity of revisiting his family in person,
and before that occasion offered, two whole
years elapsed, during which, the illustrious
prince Eugene gained the celebrated battle of
Belgrade, and afterwards made himself master
of that important frontier.
