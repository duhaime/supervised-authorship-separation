He meditates schemes of importance. 
It was in these parties, that he attracted the
notice and friendship of his patron's daughter,
a girl by two years older than himself, who
was not insensible to his qualifications, and looked
upon him with the most favourable eyes of
prepossession. Whether or not he at this period
of his life began to project plans for availing
himself of her susceptibility, is uncertain; 
but without all doubt, he cultivated her esteem
with as obsequious and submissive attention, as
if he had already formed the design, which, in
his advanced age, he attempted to put in execution. 

Divers circumstances conspired to promote
him in the favour of this young lady; the
greenness of his years secured him from any
suspicion of salacious aim; so that he was indulged
in frequent opportunities of conversing
with his young mistress, whose parents encouraged
this communication, by which they hoped
she would improve in speaking the language
of her father. Such connections naturally
produce intimacy and friendship. Fathom's
person was agreeable, his talents calculated for
the meridian of those parties, and his manners
so engaging, that there would have been no
just subject for wonder, had he made an impression
upon the tender unexperienced heart of
Mademoiselle de Mevil, whose beauty was not
so attractive as to extinguish his hope, in raising
up a number of formidable rivals; though
her expectations of fortune were such as commonly
lend additional lustre to personal merit. 
All these considerations were so many steps
towards the success of Ferdinand's pretensions; 
and though he cannot be supposed to have perceived
them at first, he, in the sequel, seemed perfectly
well apprized of his advantages, and used
them to the full extent of his faculties. Observing
that she delighted in music, he betook himself
to the study of that art, and by dint of application
and a tolerable ear, learned of himself
to accompany her with a german flute, while
she sung and played upon the harpsichord. The
count seeing his inclination, and the progress
he had made, resolved that his capacity should
not be lost for want of cultivation; and accordingly
provided him with a master, by
whom he was instructed in the principles of 

the art, and soon became a proficient in playing
upon the violin. 
In the practice of these improvements and
avocations, and in attendance upon his young
master, whom he took care never to disoblige or
neglect, he attained to the age of sixteen, without
feeling the least abatement in the friendship
and generosity of those upon whom he depended; 
but, on the contrary, receiving every day
fresh marks of their bounty and regard. He
had before this time, been smit with the ambition
of making a conquest of the young lady's
heart; and foresaw manifold advantages to
himself, in becoming son-in-law to count Melvil,
who, he never doubted, would soon be reconciled
to the match, if once it could be affectuated
without his knowledge. Although
he thought he had great reason to believe that
Mademoiselle looked upon him with an eye of
peculiar favour, his disposition was happily
tempered with an ingredient of caution, that
hindered him from acting with precipitation,
and he had discerned in the young lady's deportment
certain indications of loftiness and
pride, which kept him in the utmost vigilance of
circumspection; for, he knew that by a premature
declaration, he should run the risque of
forfeiting all the advantages he had gained, and
blasting those expectations that now blossomed
so gaily in his heart. 
Restricted by these reflections, he acted at a
wary distance, and determined to proceed by
the method of sap, and summoning all his artifice
and attractions to his aid, employed them
under the insidious cover of profound respect
in order to undermine those bulwarks of 

haughtiness or discretion, which, otherwise,
might have rendered his approaches to her impracticable. 
With a view to enhance the value
of his company, and sound her sentiments
at the same time, he became more reserved
than usual, and seldomer engaged in her parties
of music and cards; yet in the midst of his
reserve he never failed in those demonstrations
of reverence and regard, which he knew perfectly
well how to express; but devised such
excuses for his absence, as she could not help
admitting. In consequence of this affected
shyness, she more than once gently chid him
for his neglect and indifference, observing,
with an ironicle air, that he was now too much
of a man to be entertained with such effeminate
diversions; but her reproofs were pronounced
with too much ease and good humour
to be agrecable to our hero, who desired to
see her ruffled and chagrined at his absence,
and to hear himself rebuked with an angry affectation
of disdain. This effort, therefore,
he reinforced with the most captivating carriage
he could assume, in those hours which he
now so sparingly bestowed upon his mistress; 
he regaled her with all the entertaining stories
he could learn or invent, particularly such as
he thought would justify and recommend the
levelling power of love, that knows no distinctions
of fortune. He sung nothing but tender
airs and passionate complaints, composed by
desponding or despairing swains; and to render
his performances of this kind the more pathetic,
interlarded them with some seasonable
sighs, while the tears which he had ever at
command, stood collected in either eye. 

It was impossible for her to overlook such
studied emotions; she, in a jocose manner, taxed
him with having lost his heart, rallied the
excess of his passion, and in a merry strain
undertook to be an advocate for his love. Her
behaviour was still wide of his wish and expectation:
he thought she would, in consequence
of her discovery, have betrayed some
interested symptom; that her face would have
undergone some favourable suffusion; that her
tongue would have faultered, her breast heaved,
and her whole deportment betokened internal
agitation and disorder; in which case,
he meant to profit by the happy impression,
and declare himself before she could possibly
recollect the dictates of her pride. Baffled
however in his endeavours, by the serenity of
the young lady, which he still deemed equivocal,
he had recourse to another experiment,
by which he believed, he should make a discovery
of her sentiments, beyond all possibility
of doubt. One day, while he accompanied
Mademoiselle in her exercises of music, he
pretended all of a sudden, to be taken ill, and
counterfeited a swoon in her apartment. Surprised
at this accident, she screamed aloud, but
far from running to his assistance, with the
transports and distraction of a lover, she ordered
her maid, who was present, to support
his head, and went in person to call for more
help: he was accordingly removed to his own
chamber, where, willing to be still more certified
of her inclinations, he prolonged the
farce, and lay groaning under the pretence of
a severe fever. 
The whole family was alarmed upon this occasion; 

for as we have already observed, he
was an universal favourite. He was immediately
visited by the old count and his lady,
who expressed the utmost concern at his distemper,
ordered him to be carefully attended,
and sent for a physician, without loss of time. 
The young gentleman would scarce stir from
his bed-side, where he ministred unto him with
all the demonstrations of brotherly affection; 
and miss exhorted him to keep up his spirits,
with many expressions of unreserved sympathy
and regard: nevertheless, he saw nothing in
her behaviour, but what might be naturally expected
from common friendship, and a compassionate
disposition, and was very much
mortified at his disappointment. 
Whether the miscarriage actually affected
his constitution, or the doctor happened to be
mistaken in his diagnostics, we shall not pretend
to determine; but the patient was certainly
treated Secundum Artem, and all his
complaints in a little time realized; for the
physician, like a true graduate, had an eye
to the apothecary, in his prescriptions; and
such was the concern and scrupulous care with
which our hero was attended, that the orders
of the faculty were performed with the utmost
punctuality. He was blooded, vomited, purged
and blistered in the usual forms, (for the
physicians of Hungary are generally as well
skilled in the arts of their occupation, as any
other leeches under the sun) and swallowed a
whole dispensary of bolusses, draughts and
apozems, by which means he became fairly
delirions in three days, and so untractable, that
he could be no longer managed according to 

rule; otherwise in all likelihood, the world
would never have enjoyed the benefit of these
adventures. In short, his constitution, tho'
unable to cope with two such formidable antagonists,
as the doctor, and the disease he
had conjured up, was no sooner rid of the
one, than it easily got the better of the other; 
and though Ferdinand, after all, found his
grand aim unaccomplished, his malady was
productive of a consequence, which though
he had not foreseen it, he did not fail to convert
to his own use and advantage.
