DEAR LEWIS,
YOUR fable of the monkey and the pig, is
what the Italians call ben trovata: but I shall not
repeat it to my apothecary, who is a proud Scotchman,
very thin skinned, and, for aught I know, may
have his degree in his pocket—A right Scotchman
has always two strings to his bow, and is in utrumque
paratus—Certain it is, I have not 'scaped a
scouring; but I believe, by means of that scouring,
I have 'scaped something worse, perhaps a
tedious fit of the gout or rheumatism; for my appetite
began to flagg, and I had certain croakings in
the bowels which boded me no good—Nay, I am
not yet quite free of these remembrances, which
warn me to be gone from this centre of infection— 
What temptation can a man of my turn and
temperament have, to live in a place where every
corner teems with fresh objects of detestation and
disgust? What kind of taste and organs must those
people have, who really prefer the adulterate enjoyments
of the town to the genuine pleasures of
a country retreat? Most people, I know, are originally
seduced by vanity, ambition, and childish
curiosity; which cannot be gratified, but in the
busy haunts of men: but, in the course of this gratification,
their very organs of sense are perverted,
and they become habitually lost to every relish of
what is genuine and excellent in its own nature. 
Shall I state the difference between my town
grievances, and my country comforts? At Brambleton-hall,
I have elbow-room within doors, and
breathe a clear, elastic, salutary air—I enjoy refreshing 

sleep, which is never disturbed by horrid
noise, nor interrupted, but in a morning, by
the sweet twitter of the martlet at my window—I
drink the virgin lymph, pure and crystalline as it
gushes from the rock, or the sparkling beverage,
home brewed from malt of my own making; or
I indulge with cider, which my own orchard affords; 
or with claret of the best growth, imported
for my own use, by a correspondent on whose
integrity I can depend; my bread is sweet and
nourishing, made from my own wheat, ground in
my own mill, and baked in my own oven, my
table is, in a great measure, furnished from my
own ground; my five-year old mutton, fed on the
fragrant herbage of the mountains, that might vie
with venison in juice and flavour; my delicious
veal, fattened with nothing but the mother's milk,
that fills the dish with gravy; my poultry from
the barn-door, that never knew confinement, but
when they were at roost; my rabbits panting from
the warren; my game fresh from the moors; my
trout and salmon struggling from the stream; oysters
from their native banks; and herrings, with
other sea-fish, I can eat in four hours after they
are taken—My sallads, roots, and pot-herbs, my
own garden yeilds in plenty and perfection; the
produce of the natural soil, prepared by moderate
cultivation. The same soil affords all the different
fruits which England may call her own, so
that my desert is every day fresh-gathered from the
tree; my dairy flows with nectarious tides of milk
and cream, from whence we derive abundance of
excellent butter, curds, and cheese; and the refuse
fattens my pigs, that are destined for hams
and bacon—I go to bed by times, and rise with the
sun—I make shift to pass the hours without weariness
or regret, and am not destitute of amusements
within doors, when the weather will not 

permit me to go abroad—I read, and chat, and
play at billiards, cards, or back-gammon—Without
doors, I superintend my farm, and execute
plans of improvement, the effects of which I enjoy
with unspeakable delight—Nor do I take less
pleasure in seeing my tenants thrive under my
auspices, and the poor live comfortably by the employment
which I provide—You know I have one
or two sensible friends, to whom I can open all my
heart; a blessing which, perhaps, I might have
sought in vain among the crowded scenes of life:
there are few others of more humble parts, whom
I esteem for their integrity; and their conversation
I find inoffensive, though not very entertaining. 
Finally, I live in the midst of honest men, and
trusty dependants, who, I flatter myself, have a
disinterested attachment to my person—You,
yourself, my dear Doctor, can vouch for the truth
of these assertions. 
Now mark the contrast at London—I am pent
up in frowzy lodgings, where there is not room
enough to swing a cat; and I breathe the steams
of endless putrefaction; and these would, undoubtedly,
produce a pestilence, if they were not qualified
by the gross acid of sea-coal, which is itself a
pernicious nuisance to lungs of any delicacy of
texture: but even this boasted corrector cannot
prevent those languid, sallow looks, that distinguish
the inhabitants of London from those ruddy
swains that lead a country life—I go to bed after
mid-night, jaded and restless from the dissipations
of the day—I start every hour from my sleep, at
the horrid noise of the watchmen bawling the hour
through every street, and thundering at every
door; a set of useless fellows, who serve no other
purpose but that of disturbing the repose of the inhabitants; 
and by five o'clock I start out of bed,
in consequence of the still more dreadful alarm 

made by the country carts, and noisy rustics bellowing
green pease under my window. If I would
drink water, I must quaff the maukish contents of
an open aqueduct, exposed to all manner of defilement; 
or swallow that which comes from the
river Thames, impregnated with all the filth of
London and Westminster—Human excrement is
the least offensive part of the concrete, which is
composed of all the drugs, minerals, and poisons,
used in mechanics and manufacture, enriched with
the putryfying carcases of beasts and men; and
mixed with the scourings of all the wash-tubs,
kennels, and common sewers within the bills of
mortality. 
This is the agreeable potation, extolled by the
Londoners, as the finest water in the universe— 
As to the intoxicating potion, sold for wine, it is a
vile, unpalatable, and pernicious sophistication,
balderdashed with cider, corn-spirit, and the juice
of sloes. In an action at law, laid against a carman
for having slaved a cask of port, it appeared
from the evidence of the cooper, that there were
not above five gallons of real wine in the whole
pipe, which held above a hundred, and even
that had been brewed and adulterated by the merchant
at Oporto. The bread I eat in London, is
a deleterious paste, mixed up with chalk, alum and
bone-ashes; insipid to the taste, and destructive to
the constitution. The good people are not ignorant
of this adulteration; but they prefer it to
wholesome bread, because it is whiter than the
meal of corn: thus they sacrifice their taste and
their health, and the lives of their tender infants,
to a most absurd gratification of a mis-judging eye; 
and the miller, or the baker, is obliged to poison
them and their families, in order to live by his
profession. The same monstrous depravity appears
in their veal, which is bleached by repeated bleedings, 

and other villanous arts, till there is not a
drop of juice left in the body, and the poor animal
is paralytic before it dies; so void of all taste, nourishment,
and savour, that a man might dine as
comfortably on a white fricasee of kid-skin gloves,
or chip hats from Leghorn. 
As they have discharged the natural colour from
their bread, their butchers meat, and poultry, their
cutlets, ragouts, fricassees, and sauces of all kinds; 
so they insist upon having the complexion of their
pot-herbs mended, even at the hazard of their
lives. Perhaps, you will hardly believe they can
be so mad as to boil their greens with brass halfpence,
in order to improve their colour; and yet
nothing is more true—Indeed, without this improvement
in the colour, they have no personal
merit. They are produced in an artificial soil,
and taste of nothing but the dunghills, from
whence they spring. My cabbage, cauliflower, and
'sparagus in the country, are as much superior in
flavour to those that are sold in Covent-garden, as
my heath-mutton is to that of St. James's-market; 
which in fact, is neither lamb nor mutton, but
something betwixt the two, gorged in the rank
fens of Lincoln and Essex, pale, coarse, and frowzy
—As for the pork, it is an abominable carnivorous
animal, fed with horseflesh and distillers
grains; and the poultry is all rotten, in consequence
of a fever, occasioned by the infamous
practice of sewing up the gut, that they may be
the sooner fattened in coops, in consequence of this
cruel retention. 
Of the fish, I need say nothing in this hot weather,
but that it comes sixty, seventy, fourscore
and a hundred miles by land-carriage; a circumstance
sufficient, without any comment, to turn a
Dutchman's stomach, even if his nose was not
saluted in every alley with the sweet flavour of 

fresh mackarel selling by retail—This is not the
season for oysters; nevertheless, it may not be
amiss to mention, that the right Colchester are
kept in slime-pits, occasionally overflowed by the
sea; and that the green colour, so much admired
by the voluptuaries of this metropolis, is occasioned
by the vitriolic scum, which rises on the surface
of the stagnant and stinking water—Our rabbits
are bred and fed in a poulterer's cellar, where they
have neither air nor exercise, consequently they
must be firm in flesh, and delicious in flavour; 
and there is no game to be had for love or money. 
It must be owned, that Covent-Garden affords
some good fruit; which, however, is always engrossed
by a few individuals of over-grown fortune,
at an exorbitant price; so that little else
than the refuse of the market falls to the share
of the community; and that is distributed by
such filthy hands, as I cannot look at without
loathing. It was but yesterday that I saw a dirty
barrow-bunter, in the street, cleaning her dusty
fruit with her own spittle; and who knows but
some fine lady of St. James's parish might admit
into her delicate mouth those very cherries, which
had been rolled and moistened between the filthy,
and, perhaps, ulcerated chops of a St. Giles's
huckster—I need not dwell upon the pallid, contaminated
mash, which they call strawberries; 
soiled and tossed by greasy paws through twenty
baskets crusted with dirt and then presented
with the worst milk, thickened with the worst
flour into a bad likeness of cream: but the milk
itself should not pass unanalysed, the produce of
faded cabbage-leaves and sour draff, lowered with
hot water, frothed with bruised snails, carried
through the streets in open pails, exposed to
foul rinsings, discharged from doors and windows, 

spittle, snot, and tobacco-quids from foot passengers,
overflowings from mud-carts, spatterings
from coach-wheels, dirt and trash chucked into
it by roguish boys for the joke's-sake, the spewings
of infants, who have slabbered in the tin-measure,
which is thrown back in that condition
among the milk, for the benefit of the next customer; 
and, finally, the vermin that drops from
the rags of the nasty drab that vends this precious
mixture, under the respectable denomination of
milk-maid. 
I shall conclude this catalogues of London dainties,
with that table-beer, guiltless of hops and
malt, vapid and nauseous; much fitter to facilitate
the operation of a vomit, than to quench
thirst and promote digestion; the tallowy rancid
mass, called butter, manufactured with candle-grease
and kitchen-stuff; and their fresh eggs, imported
from France and Scotland. —Now, all these
enormities might be remedied with a very little
attention to the article of police, or civil regulation; 
but the wise patriots of London have taken
it into their heads, that all regulation is inconsistent
with liberty; and that every man ought to
live in his own way, without restraint—Nay, as
there is not sense enough left among them, to be
discomposed by the nuisances I have mentioned,
they may, for aught I care, wallow in the mire of
their own pollution. 
A companionable man will, undoubtedly, put
up with many inconveniences for the sake of enjoying
agreeable society. A facetious friend of mine
used to say, the wine could not be bad, where
the company was agreeable; a maxim which,
however, ought to be taken cum grano salis: but
what is the society of London, that I should be
tempted, for its sake, to mortify my senses, and
compound with such uncleanness as my soul abhors? 

All the people I see, are too much engrossed
by schemes of interest or ambition, to
have any room left for sentiment or friendship— 
Even in some of my old acquaintance, those
schemes and pursuits have obliterated all traces of
our former connexion—Conversation is reduced to
party-disputes, and illiberal altercation—Social
commerce, to formal visits and card-playing—If
you pick up a diverting original by accident, it
may be dangerous to amuse yourself with his
oddities—He is generally a tartar at bottom: a
sharper, a spy, or a lunatic. Every person you
deal with endeavours to over-reach you in the way
of business; you are preyed upon by idle mendicants,
who beg in the phrase of borrowing, and
live upon the spoils of the stranger—Your tradesmen
are without conscience, your friends without
affection, and your dependants without fidelity— 
My letter would swell into a treatise, were I to
particularize every cause of offence that fills up
the measure of my aversion to this, and every
other crowded city—Thank Heaven! I am not
so far sucked into the vortex, but that I can disengage
myself without any great effort of philosophy
—From this wild uproar of knavery, folly, and
impertinence, I shall fly with double relish to the
serenity of retirement, the cordial effusions of
unreserved friendship, the hospitality and protection
of the rural gods; in a word the jucunda oblivia
vitæ, which Horace himself had not taste
enough to enjoy.— 
I have agreed for a good travelling-coach and
four, at a guinea a day, for three months certain; 
and next week we intend to begin our journey to
the North, hoping still to be with you by the
latter end of October—I shall continue to write
from every stage where we make any considerable
halt as often as any thing occurs which I think 

can afford you the least amusement. In the mean
time, I must beg you will superintend the œconomy
of Barns, with respect to my hay and corn
harvests; assured that my ground produces nothing
but what you may freely call your own—On any
other terms I should be ashamed to subscribe myself 
your unvariable friend,
Matt. Bramble. 
London, June 8.
