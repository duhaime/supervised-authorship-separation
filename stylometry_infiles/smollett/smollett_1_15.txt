He is reduced to a dreadful dilemma, in consequence
of an assignation with the wife. 
Nor was his whole care and attention engrossed
by the execution of this scheme
upon the daughter. While he managed his
concerns in that quarter, with incredible ardour
and application, he was not the less indefatigable
in the prosecution of his design upon
the mother-in-law, which he forewarded with
all his art, during those opportunities he enjoyed
in the absence of Wilhelmina, who was frequently
called away by the domestic duties of the
house. The passions of the jeweller's wife
were in such a state of exaltation, as exempted
our hero from the repulses and fatigue attending
a long siege. 
We have already observed how cunningly he
cattered for the gratification of her ruling appetite,
and have exhibited pregnant proofs of his
ability in gaining upon the human heart; the
reader will not therefore be surprized at the
rapidity of his conquest over the affections of
a lady whose complexion was perfectly amorous,
and whose vanity laid her open to all the
attempts of adulation. In a word, matters
were quickly brought to such a mutual understanding,
that one evening, while they amused
themselves at lansquenet, Fathom conjured her
to give him the rendezvous next day, at the 

house of any third person of her own sex, in
whose discretion she could confide; and after
a few affected scruples on her side, which he
well knew how to surmount, she complied
with his request, and the circumstances of the
appointment were settled accordingly. After
this treaty, their satisfaction rose to such a
warmth, and the conversation became so reciprocally
endearing, that our gallant expressed
his impatience of waiting so long for the accomplishment
of his wishes; and with the
most eager transport, begged she would, if
possible, curtail the term of his expectation,
that his brain might not suffer by his standing
so many tedious hours on the giddy verge of
rapture. 
The dame, who was naturally compassionate,
sympathized with his condition, and unable
to resist his pathetic supplications, gave
him to understand that his desire could not be
granted, without subjecting them both to some
hazard, but that she was disposed to run any
risque in behalf of his happiness and peace. 
After this affectionate preamble, she told him
that her husband was then engaged in a quarterly
meeting of the jewellers, from whence
he never failed to return quite overwhelmed
with wine, tobacco, and the phlegm of his own
constitution; so that he would fall fast asleep
as soon as his head should touch the pillow; 
and she be at liberty to entertain the lover without
interruption, provided he could find means
to deceive the jealous vigilance of Wilhelmina,
and conceal himself in some corner of the
house, unsuspected and unperceived. 
Our lover, remembering his adventure with 

the daughter, would have willingly dispensed
with this expedient, and began to repent of the
eagerness with which he had preferred his sollicitation; 
but, seeing there was now no opportunity
of retracting with honour, he affected
to enter heartily into the conversation, and after
much canvassing, it was determined that
while Wilhelmina was employed in the kitchen,
the mother should conduct our adventurer to
the outward door, where he should pay the
compliment of parting, so as to be overheard
by the young lady, but in the mean time, glide
softly into the jeweller's bed-chamber, which
was a place they imagined least liable to the
effects of a daughter's prying disposition; and
conceal himself in a large press or wardrobe,
that stood in one corner of the apartment. 
The scene was immediately acted with great
success, and our hero cooped up in his cage,
where he waited so long, that his desires began
to subside, and his imagination to aggravate the
danger of his situation. 
“Suppose,” said he to himself, “this brutal
German, instead of being stupified with wine,
should come home inflamed with brandy, to
the use of which he is sometimes addicted; far
from feeling any inclination to sleep, he will
labour under the most fretful anxiety of
watching, every irascible particle in his disposition
will be exasperated: he will be offended
with every object that may present itself to his
view, and if there is the least ingredient of
jealousy in his temper, it will manifest itself in
riot and rage. What if his frenzy should
prompt him to search his wife's chamber for
gallants? This would certainly be the first place 

to which he would direct his inquiry; or,
granting this supposition chimerical, I may be
seized with an irresistible inclination to cough,
before he is oppressed with sleep: he may be
waked by the noise I shall make in disengaging
myself from this embarrassed situation; and finally,
I may find it impracticable to retire unseen
or unheard, after every thing else shall
have succeeded to my wish.” 
These suggestions did not at all contribute
to the quiet of our adventurer, who having
waited three whole hours in the most uncomfortable
suspence, heard the jeweller brought
into the room in that very condition which
his fears had prognosticated. He had, it seems,
quarrelled over his cups with another tradesman,
and received a salutation on the forehead
with a candlestick, which, not only left
an ignominious and painful mark upon his
countenance, but even disordered his brain to
a very dangerous degree of delirium: so that,
instead of allowing himself quietly to be undressed
and put to bed by his wife, he answered
all her gentle admonitions and caresses,
with the most opprobrious invectives and obstreperous
behaviour; and though he did not
tax her with infidelity to his bed, he virulently
accused her of extravagance and want of
œconomy, observed her expensive way of living
would bring him to a morsal of bread, and
unfortunately recollecting the attempt of the
supposed thief, started up from his chair,
swearing by God's mother, that he would
forthwith arm himself with a brace of pistols,
and search every apartment of the house. 
“That press,” said he, with great vociferation, 

“may, for aught I know, be the receptacle of
some ruffian.” 
So saying, he approached the ark in which
Fathom was embarked, and exclaiming “Come
forth, Satan,” applied his foot to the door of it,
with such violence as threw him from the centre
of gravity, and laid him sprawling on his
back. This address made such an impression
upon our adventurer, that he had well nigh
obeyed the summons, and burst from his concealment,
in a desperate effort to escape, without
being recognized by the intoxicated German:
and indeed had the application been repeated,
he in all likelihood would have tried
the experiment; for, by this time, his terrors
had waxed too strong to be much longer suppressed:
from this hazardous enterprize, he
was however exempted by a lucky accident
that happened to his disturber, whose head
chancing to pitch upon the corner of a chair,
in his fall, he was immediately lulled into a
trance; during which, the considerate lady
guessing the disorder of her gallant, and
dreading further interruption, very prudently
released him from his confinement, after she
had put out the light, and in the dark conveyed
him to the door, where he was comforted
with the promise that she would punctually
remember the rendezvous of next day. 
She then invoked the assistance of the servants,
who being waked for the purpose, lifted
up their master, and tumbled him into bed,
while Ferdinand hied him home in an universal
sweat, blessing himself from any future atchievement
of that sort, in an house, where
he had been twice in such imminent danger of 

life and reputation. Nevertheless, he did not
fail to honour the assignation, and avail himself
of the disposition his mistress manifested,
to make him all the recompence in her power,
for the disappointment and chagrin which he
had undergone.
