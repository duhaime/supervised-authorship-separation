I attemp to recover my watch and jewel,
but to no purpose—resolve to revenge
myself on Strutwell by my importunity
—am reduced to my last guinea— 
obliged to inform Strap of my necessity,
who is almost distracted with the news— 
but nevertheless obliged to pawn my best
sword for present subsistence—that
small supply being exhausted, I am almost
stupified with my misfortunes—go to
the gaming table, by the advice of Banter,
and come off with unexpected success
—Strap's exstacy—Mrs. Gawkey
waits upon me, professes remorse for her
perfidy, and implores my assistance—I do
myself a piece of justice by her means, and
afterwards reconcile her to her father. 
I was so confounded that I could make no reply
to Banter, who reproached me with great
indignation, for having thrown away upon rascals,
that which, had it been converted into ready
money, would have supported the rank of a
gentleman for some months, and enabled me,
at the same time, to oblige my friends. — 
Stupified as I was, I could easily divine the source
of his concern, but sneaked away in a solitary
manner, without yielding the least answer to his 

expostulations; and began to deliberate with myself,
in what manner I should attempt to retrieve
the moveables I had so foolishly lost. —I would
have thought it no robbery to take them again by
force, could I have done it without any danger of
being detected; but as I could have no such
opportunity, I resolved to work by finesse, and
go immediately to the lodgings of Straddle, where
I was so fortunate as to find him. —“My Lord,
(said I) I have just now recollected, that the
diamond I had the honour of presenting to
you, is loosened a little in the socket, and
there is a young fellow just arrived from Paris,
who is reckoned the best jeweller in Europe; 
I knew him in France, and if your lordship
will give me leave, will carry the ring to him
to be set to rights.” —His lordship was not to
be caught in this snare—he thanked me for my
offer, and let me know, that having himself observed
the defect, he had already sent it to his
own jeweller to be mended. —And indeed, by
this time, I believe it was in the jeweller's hands,
though not in order to be mended, for it stood
in need of no alteration. 
Baulked in this piece of politicks, I cursed my
simplicity; but resolved to play a surer game
with the Earl, which I had thus devised. —I did
not doubt of being admitted into familiar conversation
with him, as before, and hoped by some
means, to get the watch into my hand, then on
pretence of winding or playing with it, drop it
on the floor, which in all probability would disorder
the work so as to stop its motion: This
event would furnish me with an opportunity of
insisting upon carrying it away in order to be
repaired; and had this happened, I should have 

been in no hurry to bring it back. —What pity
it was I could not find an occasion of putting
this fine scheme in execution! When I
went to renew my visit to his lordship, my access
to the parlour was as free as ever; but after
I had waited some time, the valet de chambre
came in with his Lord's compliments, and a
desire to see me to-morrow at his levée, being
at present so much indisposed that he could not
see company. —I intepreted this message into a
bad omen, and came away muttering curses against
his lordship's politeness, and ready to go
to loggerheads with myself for being so egregiously
duped. —But that I might have some satisfaction
for the loss I had sustained, I besieged
him closely at his levée, and persecuted him with
my solicitations; not without faint hopes indeed,
of reaping something more from my industry,
than the bare pleasure of making him uneasy; 
though I could never obtain another private
hearing, during the whole course of my attendance; 
neither had I resolution enough, to undeceive
Strap, whose looks in a little time, were
so whetted with impatience, that whenever I
came home, his eyes devoured me, as it were,
with eagerness of attention. 
At length, however, finding myself reduced
to my last guinea, I was compelled to disclose
my necessity, though I endeavoured to sweeten
the discovery by rehearsing to him the daily assurances
I received from my patron. —But these
promises were not of efficacy sufficient to
support the spirits of my friend, who no sooner
understood the lowness of my finances, than uttering
a dreadful groan, he exclaimed, “In the
name of God, what shall we do?” In order 

to comfort him, I said that many of my acquaintance,
who were in a worse condition than
we, supported, notwithstanding, the character
and appearance of gentlemen; and advising him
to thank God that we had as yet incurred no
debt, proposed he should pawn my sword of steel
inlaid with gold, and trust to my discretion for
the rest. This expedient was wormwood and
gall to poor Strap, who, in spite of his invincible
affection for me, still retained notions of œconomy
and expence suitable to the narrowness of his education; 
nevertheless he complied with my request,
and raised seven pieces on the sword in a twinkling. 
—This supply, inconsiderable as it was, made
me as happy for the present, as if I had had five
hundred pounds in bank; for by this time I was
so well skilled in procrastinating every troublesome
reflection, that the prospect of want seldom
affected me very much, let it be ever so near. 
—And now indeed it was nearer than I imagined; 
for my landlord having occasion for money, put
me in mind of my being indebted to him five
guineas in lodging; and telling me he had a sum
to make up, begged I would excuse his importunity
and discharge the debt. Though I could
ill spare so much cash; my pride took the resolution
of disbursing it, which I did in a cavalier
manner, after he had written a discharge, telling
him with an air of scorn and resentment, I saw
he was resolved that I should not be long in his
books; while Strap, who stood by, and knew
my circumstances, wrung his hands in secret,
gnawed his nether lip, and turned yellow with
despair. —Whatever appearance of indifference
my vanity enabled me to put on, I was thunderstruck
with this demand, which I had no sooner 

satisfied, than I hastened into company, with a
view of beguiling my cares with conversation, or
of drowning them in wine. 
After dinner, a party was accordingly made in
the coffee-house, from whence we adjourned to
the tavern, where instead of sharing the mirth of
the company, I was as much chagrined at their
good humour as a damned soul in hell would be
at a glimpse of heaven. —In vain did I swallow
bumper after bumper! the wine had lost its effect
upon me, and so far from raising my dejected
spirits, could not even lay me asleep. —Banter,
who was the only intimate I had (Strap excepted)
perceived my anxiety, and when we broke up,
reproached me with pusilanimity, for being cast
down at any disappointment that such a rascal as
Strutwell could be the occasion of. —I told him I
did not at all see how Strutwell's being a rascal
alleviated my misfortune; and gave him to understand
that my present grief did not so much
proceed from that disappointment, as from the
low ebb of my fortune, which was sunk to
something less than two guineas. —At this declaration,
he cried, “Pshaw! is that all?” and
assured me, there were a thousand ways of living
in town without fortune, he himself having subsisted
many years entirely by his wit. —I expressed an
eager desire of being acquainted with some of
these methods, and he, without further expostulation,
bid me follow him. —He conducted me to
a house under the piazzas in Convent Garden,
which we entered, and having delivered our
swords to a grim fellow who demanded them at
the foot of the stair-case, ascended to the second
story, where I saw multitudes of people standing
round two gaming tables, loaded in a manner, 

with gold and silver. —My conductor let me
know that this was the house of a worthy Scotch
Lord, who availing himself of the privilege of
his peerage, had set up publick gaming tables,
from the profits of which he drew a comfortable
livelihood. —He then explained the difference between
the sitters and the betters; characterized
the first as old rooks, and the last as bubbles; 
and advised me to try my fortune at the silver
table by betting a crown at a time. —Before I
would venture any thing, I considered the company
more particularly, and there appeared such
a groupe of villainous faces, that I was struck
with horror and astonishment at the sight! I
signified my surprize to Banter, who whispered
in my ear, that the bulk of those present were
composed of sharpers, highwaymen, and apprentices,
who having embezzled their master's cash,
made a desperate push in this place, to make up
their deficiencies. —This account did not encourage
me to hazard any part of my small pittance; 
but at length being teized by the importunities of
my friend, who assured me there was no danger
of being ill used, people being hired by the
owner to see justice done to every body; I began
by risquing one shilling, and in less than an hour,
my winning amounted to thirty. —Convinced by
this time of the fairness of the game, and animated
with success, there was no need of further
persuasion to continue the play: I lent Banter
(who seldom had any money in his pocket) a
guinea, which he carried to the gold table and
lost in a moment. —He would have borrowed
another, but finding me deaf to his arguments,
went away in a pet. —Mean while my gain advanced
to six pieces, and my desire of more increased 

in proportion; so that I moved to the
higher table, where I laid half a guinea on every
throw, and fortune still favouring me, I became
a sitter, in which capacity I remained until it was
broad day; when I found myself, after many
vicissitudes, one hundred and fifty guineas in
pocket. 
Thinking it now high time to retire with my
booty, I asked if any body would take my place,
and made a motion to rise; upon which an old
gascon, who sat opposite to me, and of whom I
had won a little money, started up with fury in
his looks, crying, “Restez foutre, restez, il faut
donner mai mon ravanchio!” At the same time,
a Jew who sat near the other, insinuated that I
was more beholden to art than fortune, for what
I had got; that he had observed me wipe the
table very often, and that some of the divisions
seemed to be greasy. This intimation produced a
great deal of clamour against me, especially among
the losers, who threatned with many oaths and
imprecations to take me up by a warrant as a
a sharper, unless I would compromise the affair
by refunding the greatest part of my winning. — 
Though I was far from being easy under this accusation,
I relied upon my innocence, threatned
in my turn to prosecute the Jew for defamation,
and boldly offered to submit my cause to the examination
of any justice in Westminster; but they
knew themselves too well to put their characters
on that issue, and finding I was not to be intimidated
into any concession, dropt their plea, and
made way for me to withdraw. —I would not
however, stir from the table until the Israelite
had retracted what he said to my disadvantage,
and asked pardon before the whole assembly. 

As I marched out with my prize, I happened
to tread upon the toes of a tall raw-boned fellow,
with a hooked nose, fierce eyes, black thick eyebrows,
a pig-tail wig of the same colour, and a
formidable hat pulled over his forehead, who
stood gnawing his fingers in the crowd, and no
sooner felt the application of my shoe-heel, than
he roared out in a tremendous voice, “Blood
and wounds! you son of a whore, what's that
for?” —I asked pardon with a great deal of
submission, and protested I had no intention of
hurting him; but the more I humbled myself
the more he stormed, and insisted upon gentlemany
satisfaction, at the same time provoking me
with scandalous names that I could not put up with; 
so that I gave a loose to my passion, returned his
Billingsgate, and challenged him to follow me
down to the piazzas. —His indignation cooling as
mine warmed, he refused my invitation, saying,
he would chuse his own time, and returned towards
the table muttering threats, which I neither
dreaded nor distinctly heard; but descending
with great deliberation, received my sword from
the door-keeper, whom I gratified with a guinea
according to the custom of the place, and went
home in a rapture of joy. 
My faithful valet, who had sat up all night in
the utmost uneasiness on my account, let me in
with his face beslubbered with tears, and followed
me to my chamber, where he stood silent like a
condemned criminal, in expectation of hearing
that every shilling was spent. —I guessed the situation
of his thoughts, and assuming a sullen
look, bid him fetch me some water to wash. — 
He replied, without lifting his eyes from the
ground, “In my simple conjecture, you have 

more occasion for rest, not having (I suppose) slept
these four and twenty hours.” —“Bring me
some water,” (said I in a peremptory tone;) upon
which he sneaked away shrugging his shoulders. 
Before he returned I had spread my whole stock
on the table in the most ostentatious manner; 
so that when it first saluted his view, he stood
like one intranced, and having rubbed his eyes
more than once, to assure himself of his being
awake, broke out into, “Lord have mercy
upon us, what a vast treasure is here!” — 
“'Tis all our own, Strap, (said I) take what is
necessary, and redeem the sword immediately.” 
He advanced towards the table, stopt short by
the way, looked at the money and me by turns,
and with a wildness in his countenance, produced
from joy checked by distrust, cried, “I dare
say, it is honestly come by.” To remove his
scruples, I made him acquainted with the whole
story of my success, on hearing of which, he
danced about the room, in an exstacy, “God
be praised!—a white stone!—God be praised!
—a white stone!” So that I was afraid the
sudden change of fortune had disordered his intellects,
and that he was run mad with joy. — 
Extremely concerned at this event, I attempted
to reason him out of his frenzy, but to no purpose; 
for, without regarding what I said, he
continued to frisk up and down, and repeat his
rhapsody of “God be praised! a white stone!” 
At last, I rose in the utmost consternation, and
laying violent hands upon him put a stop to his
extravagance, by fixing him down to a settee
that was in the room. —This constraint banished
his delirium; he started as if just awoke, and
terrified at my behaviour, cried, “What is the 

matter?” When he learned the cause of my
apprehension, he was ashamed of his transports,
and told me, that in mentioning the white stone,
he alluded to the Dies fasti of the Romans, alba
lapide notati. 
Having no inclination to sleep, I secured my
cash, dressed, and was just going abroad, when
the servant of the house told me, there was a
gentlewoman at the door, who wanted to speak
with me. —Surprized at this information, I bid
Strap shew her up, and in less than a minute saw
a young woman of a shabby decayed appearance
enter my room. After half a dozen court'sies,
she began to sob, and told me her name was
Gawkey; upon which I immediately recollected
the features of Miss Lavement, who had been
the first occasion of my misfortunes. —Though I
had all the reason in the world, to resent her
treacherous usage of me, I was moved at her
distress, and professing my sorrow at seeing her
so reduced, desired her to sit, and enquired into
the particulars of her situation. —She fell upon
her knees, and implored my forgivenness for the
injuries she had done me, protesting before God,
that she was forced against her inclination, into
that hellish conspiracy which had almost deprived
me of my life, by the intreaties of her husband,
who having been afterwards renounced by his
father on account of his marriage with her, and
unable to support a family on his pay, left his
wife at her father's house, and went with the
regiment to Germany, where he was broke for
misbehaviour at the battle of Dettingen; since
which time she had heard no tidings of him. She
then gave me to understand with many symptoms
of penitence, that it was her misfortune to bear a 

child four months after marriage, by which her parents
were so incensed, that she was turned out of
doors with the infant, that died soon after; and
had hitherto subsisted in a miserable indigent manner,
on the extorted charity of a few friends,
who were now quite tired of giving; that not
knowing where or how to support herself one day
longer, she had fled for succour even to me,
who of all mankind had the least cause to assist
her, relying upon the generosity of my disposition,
which, she hoped, would be pleased with
this opportunity of avenging itself in the noblest
manner, on the wretch who had wronged me. — 
I was very much affected with her discourse, and
having no cause to suspect the sincerity of her repentance,
raised her up, freely pardoned all she
had done against me, and promised to befriend her
as much as lay in my power. 
Since my last arrival in London, I had made no
advances to the apothecary, imagining it would
be impossible for me to make my innocence appear,
so unhappily was my accusation circumstanced: 
Strap indeed had laboured to justify me
to the schoolmaster; but so far from succeeding
in his attempt, Mr. Concordance dropt all correspondence
with him, because he refused to quit
his connexion with me. —Things being in this
situation, I thought a fairer opportunity of vindicating
my character could not offer, than that
which now presented itself;—therefore stipulated
with Mrs. Gawkey, that before I yielded her the
least assistance, she should do me the justice to
clear my reputation, by explaining upon oath before
a Magistrate, the whole of the conspiracy, as it
had been executed against me. —When she had
given me this satisfaction, I presented her with 

five guineas, a sum so much above her expectation,
that she could scarce believe the evidence
of her senses, and was ready to worship me for
my benevolence. —The declaration signed with
her own hand, I sent to her father, who, upon recollecting
and comparing the circumstances of
my charge, was convinced of my integrity, and
waited on me next day, in company with his
friend the schoolmaster, to whom he had communicated
my vindication. —After mutual salutation,
Monsieur Lavement began a long apology
for the unjust treatment I had received; but I
saved him a good deal of breath, by interrupting
his harrangue, and assuring him, that so far from
entertaining any resentment against him, I thought
myself obliged to his lenity, which allowed me to
escape, after such strong presumptions of guilt appeared
against me. Mr. Concordance thinking
it now his turn to speak, observed, that Mr.
Random had too much candour and sagacity to
be disobliged at their conduct, which, all things
considered, could not have been otherwise, with
any honesty of intention. “Indeed (said he)
if the plot had been unravelled to us by
any supernatural intelligence; if it had been
whispered by a genie, communicated by a
dream, or revealed by an angel from on high,
we should have been to blame in crediting ocular
demonstration;—but as we were left in
the mist of mortality, it cannot be expected
we should be incapable of imposition. —I do
assure you, Mr. Random, no man on earth
is more pleased than I am at this triumph of
your character; and as the news of your misfortune
panged me to the very intrails, this 

manifestation of your innocence makes my
midrif quiver with joy.” —I thanked him for
his concern, desired them to undeceive those of
their acquaintance who judged harshly of me, and
having treated them with a glass of wine, represented
to Lavement the deplorable condition
of his daughter, and pleaded her cause so effectually,
that he consented to settle a small annuity
on her for life; but could not be persuaded to
take her home, because her mother was so much
incensed that she would never see her.
