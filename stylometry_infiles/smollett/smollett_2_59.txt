Dear knight,
I AM now little short of the Ultima Thule, if
this appellation properly belongs to the Orkneys or
Hebrides. These last are now lying before me, to
the amount of some hundred, scattered up and
down the Deucalidonian sea, affording the most
picturesque and romantic prospect I ever beheld — 

I write this letter in a gentleman's house, near
the town of Inverary, which may be deemed the
capital of the West Highlands, famous for nothing
so much as for the stately castle begun, and actually
covered in by the late duke of Argyle, at a
prodigious expence —Whether it will ever be completely
finished is a question— 
But, to take things in order. —We left Edinburgh
ten days ago; and the further North we proceed,
we find Mrs. Tabitha the less manageable; 
so that her inclinations are not of the nature of the
loadstone; they point not towards the pole. What
made her leave Edinburgh with reluctance at last,
if we may believe her own assertions, was a dispute
which she left unfinished with Mr. Moffat,
touching the eternity of hell torments. That gentleman,
as he advanced in years, began to be sceptical
on this head, till, at length he declared open
war against the common acception of the word eternal. 
He is now persuaded, that eternal signifies no
more than an indefinite number of years; and that
the most enormous sinner may be quit for nine millions,
nine hundred thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine
years of hell fire; which term or period, as he
very well observes, forms but an inconsiderable
drop, as it were, in the ocean of eternity —For
this mitigation he contends, as a system agreeable
to the ideas of goodness and mercy, which we annex
to the supreme Being —Our aunt seemed willing
to adopt this doctrine in favour of the wicked, but
he hinted, that no person whatever was so righteous
as to be exempted entirely from punishment in a future state; 
and that the most pious Christian upon
earth might think himself very happy to get off for
a fast of seven or eight thousand years in the midst
of fire and brimstone. Mrs. Tabitha revolted at this
dogma, which filled her at once with horror and
indignation —She had recourse to the opinion of 

Humphry Clinker, who roundly declared it was the
popish doctrine of purgatory, and quoted scripture
in defence of the fire everlasting, prepared for the
devil and his angels —The reverend mester Mackcorkendale,
and all the theologists and saints of that
persuasion were consulted, and some of them had
doubts about the matter; which doubts and scruples
had begun to infect our aunt, when we took our
departure from Edinburgh. 
We passed through Linlithgow, where there
was an elegant royal palace, which is now gone to
decay, as well as the town itself —This too is
pretty much the case with Stirling, though it still
boasts of a fine old castle, in which the kings of
Scotland were wont to reside in their minority — 
But Glasgow is the pride of Scotland, and, indeed,
it might very well pass for an elegant and flourishing
city in any part of Christendom. There we
had the good fortune to be received into the house
of Mr. Moore, an eminent surgeon, to whom we
were recommended by one of our friends at Edinburgh; 
and, truly, he could not have done us more
essential service —Mr. Moore is a merry facetious
companion, sensible and shrewd, with a considerable
fund of humour; and his wife an agreeable woman,
well bred, kind, and obliging —Kindness, which I
take to be the essence of good-nature and humanity,
is the distinguishing characteristic of the Scotch ladies
in their own country —Our landlord shewed
us every thing, and introduced us to all the world
at Glasgow; where, through his recommendation,
we were complimented with the freedom of the
town. Considering the trade and opulence of this
place, it cannot but abound with gaiety and diversions 
—Here is a great number of young fellows
that rival the youth of the capital in spirit and expence; 
and I was soon convinced, that all the female
beauties of Scotland were not assembled at the 

hunters ball in Edinburgh —The town of Glasgow
flourishes in learning, as well as in commerce — 
Here is an university, with professors in all the different
branches of science, liberally endowed, and
judiciously chosen —It was vacation time when I
passed, so that I could not entirely satisfy my curiosity; 
but their mode of education is certainly
preferable to ours in some respects —The students
are not left to the private instruction of tutors; but
taught in public schools or classes, each science by
its particular professor or regent. 
My uncle is in raptures with Glasgow —He not
only visited all the manufactures of the place, but
made excursions all round, to Hamilton, Paisley,
Renfrew, and every other place within a dozen
miles, where there was any thing remarkable to be
seen in art or nature. I believe the exercise, occasioned
by these jaunts, was of service to my sister
Liddy, whose appetite and spirits begin to revive 
—Mrs. Tabitha displayed her attractions as usual,
and actually belived she had entangled one Mr.
Maclellan, a rich inkle manufacturer, in her snares; 
but when matters came to an explanation, it appeared
that his attachment was altogether spiritual,
founded upon an intercourse of devotion, at the
meeting of Mr. John Wesley; who, in the course
of his evangelical mission, had come hither in person 
—At length, we set out for the banks of Lough-Lomond,
passing through the little borough of
Dumbarton, or (as my uncle will have it) Dunbritton,
where there is a castle more curious than any
thing of the kind I had ever seen —It is honoured
with a particular description by the elegant Buchannan,
as an arx inexpugnabilis, and, indeed, it
must have been impregnable by the ancient manner
of besieging. It is a rock of considerable extent,
rising with a double top, in an angle formed by the
confluence of two rivers, the Clyde and the Leven; 

perpendicular and inaccessible on all sides, except
in one place where the entrance is fortified; and
there is no rising-ground in the neighbourhood from
whence it could be damaged by any kind of battery. 
From Dumbarton, the west Highlands appear in
the form of huge, dusky mountains, piled one over
another; but this prospect is not at all surprising to
a native of Glamorgan —We have fixed our headquarters
at Cameron, a very neat country-house
belonging to comissary Smollet, where we found
every sort of accommodation we could desire —It
is situated like a Druid's temple, in a grove of oak,
close by the side of Lough-Lomond, which is a surprising
body of pure transparent water, unfathomably
deep in many places, six or seven miles broad,
four and twenty miles in length, displaying above
twenty green islands, covered with wood; some of
them cultivated for corn, and many of them stocked
with red deer —They belong to different gentlemen,
whose seats are scattered along the banks of
the lake, which are agreeably romantic beyond all
conception. My uncle and I have left the women
at Cameron, as Mrs. Tabitha would by no means
trust herself again upon the water, and to come
hither it was necessary to cross a small inlet of the
sea, in an open ferry-boat —This country appears
more and more wild and savage the further we advance; 
and the people are as different from the
Low-land Scots, in their looks, garb, and language,
as the mountaineers of Brecknock are from
the inhabitants of Herefordshire. 
When the Lowlanders want to drink a chear-upping-cup,
they go to the public house, called
the Change-house, and call for a chopine of two-penny,
which is a thin, yeasty beverage, made
of malt; not quite so strong as the table-beer of
England —This is brought in a pewter
stoop, shaped like a skittle, from whence it is
emptied into a quaff; that is, a curious cup 

made of different pieces of wood, such as box
and ebony, cut into little staves, joined alternately,
and secured with delicate hoops, have
two ears or handles —It holds about a gill, is sometimes
tipt round the mouth with silver, and has a
plate of the same metal at bottom, with the landlord's
cypher engraved —The Highlanders, on the
contrary, despise this liquor, and regale themselves
with whisky; a malt spirit, as strong as geneva,
which they swallow in great quantities, without
any signs of inebriation. They are used to it from
the cradle, and find it an excellent preservative
against the winter cold, which must be extreme
on these mountains —I am told that it is given
with great success to infants, as a cordial in the
confluent small-pox, when the eruption seems to
flag, and the symptoms grow unfavourable —The
Highlanders are used to eat much more animal food
than falls to the share of their neighbours in the
Low-country —They delight in hunting; having
plenty of deer and other game, with a great number
of sheep, goats, and black cattle running wild,
which they scruple not to kill as venison, without
being at much pains to ascertain the property. 
Inverary is but a poor town, though it stands
immediately under the protection of the duke of
Argyle, who is a mighty prince in this part of Scotland. 
The peasants live in wretched cabbins, and
seem very poor; but the gentlemen are tolerably
well lodged, and so loving to strangers, that a man
runs some risque of his life from their hospitality — 
It must be observed that the poor Highlanders are
now seen to disadvantage —They have been not
only disarmed by act of parliament; but also deprived
of their ancient garb, which was both graceful
and convenient; and what is a greater hardship
still, they are compelled to wear breeches; a restraint
which they cannot bear with any degree of 

patience: indeed, the majority wear them, not in
the proper place, but on poles or long staves over
their shoulders —They are even debarred the use
of their striped stuff, called Tartane, which was
their own manufacture, prized by them above all
the velvets, brocards, and tissues of Europe and
Asia. They now lounge along in loose great coats,
of coarse russet, equally mean and cumbersome,
and betray manifest marks of dejection —Certain
it is, the government could not have taken a more
effectual method to break their national spirit. 
We have had princely sport in hunting the flag
on these mountains —These are the lonely hills of
Morven, where Fingal and his heroes enjoyed the
same pastime: I feel an enthusiastic pleasure when
I survey the brown heath that Ossian wont to tread; 
and hear the wind whistle through the bending
grass —When I enter our landlord's hall, I look
for the suspended harp of that divine bard, and
listen in hopes of hearing the aerial sound of his
respected spirit —The Poems of Ossian are in every
mouth —A famous antiquarian of this country,
the laird of Mackfarlane, at whose house we dined
a few days ago, can repeat them all in the original
Gaelick, which has a great affinity to the
Welch, not only in the general sound, but also in
a great number of adical words; and I make no
doubt but that they are both sprung from the same
origin. I was not a little surprised, when asking a
Highlander one day, if he knew where we should
find any game? he replied, “bu niel Sassenagh,” 
which signifies no English: the very same answer I
should have received from a Welchman, and almost
in the same words. The Highlanders have
no other name for the people of the Low-country,
but Sassenagh, or Saxons; a strong presumption,
that the Lowland Scots and the English are derived
from the same stock —The peasants of these 

hills strongly resemble those of Wales in their
looks, their manners, and habitations; every thing
I see, and hear, and feel, seems Welch —The
mountains, vales, and streams; the air and climate; 
the beef, mutton, and game, are all Welch 
—It must be owned, however, that this people
are better provided than we in some articles — 
They have plenty of red deer and roebuck, which
are fat and delicious at this season of the year — 
Their sea teems with amazing quantities of the
finest fish in the world; and they find means to
procure very good claret at a very small expence. 
Our landlord is a man of consequence in this
part of the country; a cadet from the family of
Argyle, and hereditary captain of one of his castles 
—His name, in plain English, is Dougal Campbell; 
but as there is a great number of the same
appellation, they are distinguished (like the Welch)
by patronimics; and as I have known an ancient
Briton called Madoc ap-Morgan, ap-Jenkin, ap-Jones,
our Highland chief designs himself Dou'l
Mac-amish mac-'oul, ich-ian, signifying Dougal,
the son of James, the son of Dougal, the son of
John —He has travelled in the course of his education,
and is disposed to make certain alterations
in his domestic œconomy; but he finds it impossible
to abolish the ancient customs of the family; 
some of which are ludicrous enough —His piper,
for example, who is an hereditary officer of the
household, will not part with the least particle of
his privileges —He has a right to wear the kilt, or
ancient Highland dress, with the purse, pistol, and
durk—a broad yellow ribbon, fixed to the chanter-pipe,
is thrown over his shoulder, and trails
along the ground, while he performs the function
of his minstrelsy; and this, I suppose, is analogous
to the pennon or flag which was formerly
carried before every knight in battle —He plays 

before the laird every Sunday in his way to the
kirk, which he circles three times, performing
the family march, which implies defiance to all
the enemies of the clan; and every morning he
plays a full hour by the clock, in the great hall,
marching backwards and forwards all the time,
with a solemn pace, attended by the laird's kinsmen,
who seem much delighted with the music — 
In this exercise, he indulges them with a variety
of pibrachs or airs, suited to the different passions,
which he would either excite or assuage. 
Mr. Campbell himself, who performs very well
on the violin, has an invincible antipathy to the
sound of the Highland bag-pipe, which sings in
the nose with a most alarming twang, and, indeed,
is quite intolerable to ears of common sensibility,
when aggravated by the echo of a vaulted hall — 
He therefore begged the piper would have some
mercy upon him, and dispense with this part of
the morning service —A consultation of the clan
being held on this occasion, it was unanimausly
agreed, that the laird's request could not be granted
without a dangerous encroachment upon the
customs of the family —The piper declared, he
could not give up for a moment the privilege he
derived from his ancestors; nor would the laird's
relations forego an entertainment which they valued
above all others —There was no remedy; 
Mr. Campbell, being obliged to acquiesce, is fain
to stop his ears with cotton; to fortify his head with
three or four night-caps, and every morning retire
into the penetralia of his habitation, in order to
avoid this diurnal annoyance. When the music
ceases, he produces himself at an open window
that looks into the court-yard, which is by this
time filled with a crowd of his vassals and dependents,
who worship his first appearance, by uncovering
their heads, and bowing to the earth 

with the most humble prostration. As all these
people have something to communicate in the way
of proposal, complaint, or petition, they wait patiently
till the laird comes forth, and, following
him in his walks, are favoured each with a short
audience in his turn. Two days ago, he dispatched
above an hundred different solicitors, in
walking with us to the house of a neighbouring
gentleman, where we dined by invitation. Our
landlord's house-keeping is equally rough and hospitable,
and favours much of simplicity of ancient times:
the great hall, paved with flat stones,
is about forty-five feet by twenty-two, and serves
not only for a dining-room, but also for a bed-chamber
to gentlemen-dependents and hangers-on
of the family. At night, half a dozen occasional
beds are ranged on each side along the wall. These
are made of fresh heath, pulled up by the roots,
and disposed in such a manner as to make a very
agreeable couch, where they lie, without any
other covering than the plaid —My uncle and I
were indulged with separate chambers and down
beds, which we begged to exchange for a layer of
heath; and indeed I never slept so much to my
satisfaction. It was not only soft and elastic, but the
plant, being in flower, diffused an agreeable fragrance
which is wonderfully refreshing and restorative. 
Yesterday we were invited to the funeral of an
old lady, the grand-mother of a gentleman in this
neighbourhood, and found ourselves in the midst
of fifty people, who were regaled with a sumptuous
feast, accompanied by the music of a dozen
pipers. In short, this meeting had all the air of
a grand festival; and the guests did such honour to
the entertainment, that many of them could not
stand when we were reminded of the business on
which we had met. The company forthwith
taking horse, rode in a very irregular cavalcade to 

the place of interment, a church, at the distance
of two long miles from the castle. On our arrival,
however, we found we had committed a small
oversight, in leaving the corpse behind; so that
we were obliged to wheel about, and met the old
gentlewoman half way, carried upon poles by the
nearest relations of her family, and attended by
the coronach, composed of a multitude of old hags,
who tore their hair, beat their breasts, and howled
most hideously. At the grave, the orator, or  senachie,
pronounced the panegyric of the defunct,
every period being confirmed by a yell of the
coronach. The body was committed to the earth,
the pipers playing a pibroch all the time; and all
the company standing uncovered. The ceremony
was closed with the discharge of pistols; then we
returned to the castle, resumed the bottle, and by
midnight there was not a sober person in the family,
the females exepted. The squire and I were,
with some difficulty, permitted to retire with our
landlord in the evening; but our intertainer was
a little chagrined at our retreat; and afterwards
seemed to think it a disparagement to his family,
that not above a hundred gallons of whiskey had
been drank upon such a solemn occasion. This
morning we got up by four, to hunt the roebuck,
and, in half an hour, found breakfast ready served
in the hall. The hunters consisted of Sir George
Colquhoun and me, as strangers, (my uncle not
choosing to be of the party) of the laird in person,
the laird's brother, the laird's brother's son, the
laird's sister's son, the laird's father's brother's son,,
and all their foster brothers, who are counted parcel
of the family: but we were attended by an infinite
number of Gaellys, or ragged Highlanders,
without shoes or stockings. 
The following articles formed our morning's repast:
one kit of boiled eggs; a second, full of 

butter; a third, full of cream; an entire cheese,
made of goat's milk; a large earthen pot full of
honey; the best part of a ham; a cold venison
pasty; a bushel of oat meal, made in thin cakes
and bannocks, with a small wheaten loaf in the
middle for the strangers; a large stone bottle full
of whisky, another of brandy, and a kilderkin of
ale. There was a ladle chained to the cream kit,
with curious wooden bickers to be filled from this
reservoir. The spirits were drank out of a silver
quaff, and the ale out of horns: great justice was
done to the collation by the guests in general; one
of them in particular ate above two dozen of hard
eggs, with a proportionable quantity of bread, butter,
and honey; nor was one drop of liquor left upon
the board. Finally, a large roll of tobacco was
presented by way of desart, and every individual
took a comfortable quid to prevent, the bad effects
of the morning air. We had a fine chase over
the mountains, after a roebuck, which we killed,
and I got home time enough to drink tea with Mrs.
Campbell and our 'squire. To-morrow we shall set
out on our return for Cameron. We propose to
cross the Firth of Clyde, and take the towns of
Greenock and Port-Glasgow in our way. This
circuit being finished, we shall turn our faces to
the south, and follow the sun with augmented velocity,
in order to enjoy the rest of the autumn in
England, where Boreas is not quite so biting as he
begins already to be on the tops of these northern
hills. But our progress from place to place shall
continue to be specified in these detached journals of, 
yours always,
J. Melford. 
Argyleshire, Sept. 3.
