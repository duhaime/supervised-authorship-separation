Renaldo meets with a living monument of justice,
and encounters a personage of some note in
those memoirs. 
As this domestic was very well qualified
for making all the proper dispositions,
and adjusting every necessary article on the
road, Renaldo totally abstracted himself from
earthly considerations, and mused without
ceasing on that theme which was the constant
subject of his contemplation. He was blind to
the objects that surrounded him; he scarce
ever felt the importunities of nature; and had
not they been reinforced by the pressing entreaties
of his attendant, he would have proceeded
without refreshment or repose. In this
absence of mind did he traverse a great part of
Germany, in his way to the Austrian Netherlands,
and arrived at the fortress of Luxemburg,
where he was obliged to tarry a whole
day on account of an accident which had happened
to his chaise. Here he went to view the
fortifications; and as he walked along the ramparts,
his ears were saluted with these words, 

“Heaven bless the noble count de Melvile!
will not he turn the eyes of compassion upon
an old fellow-soldier reduced to misfortune
and disgrace?” 
Surprised at this address, which was attended
with the clanking of chains, Renaldo lifted
up his eyes, and perceived the person who
spoke, to be one of two malefactors shackled
together, who had been sentenced for some
crime to work as labourers on the fortifications:
his face was so covered with hair, and
his whole appearance so disguised by the squalid
habit which he wore, that the count could
not recollect his features, until he gave him to
understand that his name was Ratchkali. Melvile
immediately recognized his fellow student
at Vienna and his brother volunteer upon the
Rhine, and expressed equal surprise and concern
at seeing him in such a deplorable situation. 
Nothing renders the soul so callous and insensible
as the searing brands of infamy and
disgrace. Without betraying the least symptoms
of shame or confusion, “Count,” says
he, “this is the fate of war, at least of the war
in which I have been engaged, ever since I took
leave of the imperial army, and retreated with
your old companion Fathom. Long life to
that original genius! If he is not unhappily
eclipsed by some unfortunate interposition, before
his terrene parts are putrified, I foresee
that he will shine a star of the first magnitude
in the world of adventure.” 
At mention of this detested name, Renaldo's
heart began to throb with indignation; yet he
suppressed the emotion, and desired to know
the meaning of that splendid encomium which 

he had bestowed upon his confederate. “It
would be quite unnecessary,” replied Ratchkali,
“for a man in my present situation to equivocate
or disguise the truth: the nature of my
disgrace is perfectly well known. I am condemned
to hard labour for life; and unless
some lucky accident (which I cannot now foresee)
shall intervene, all I can expect is some alleviation
of my hard lot from the generosity of
such gentlemen as you who compassionate the
sufferings of your fellow creatures. In order
to engage this benevolence the more in my behalf,
I shall (if you will give me the hearing)
faithfully inform you of some particulars, which
it may import you to know, concerning my
old acquaintance Ferdinand Count Fathom,
whose real character hath perhaps hitherto
escaped your notice.” 
Then he proceeded to give a regular detail
of all the strokes of finesse which he, in conjunction
with our adventurer, had practised
upon Melvile and others, during their residence
at Vienna, and the campaigns they had
made upon the Rhine: he explained the nature
of the robbery which was supposed to have
been done by the count's valet, together with
the manner of their desertion; he described
his separation from Fathom, their meeting at
London, the traffic they carried on in copartnership:
and the misfortune that reduced Ferdinand
to the condition in which he was found
by Melvile. 
“After having gratified the honest lawyer,” 
said he, “with a share of the unfortunate
Fathom's spoils, and packed up all my
own valuable effects, my new auxiliary Maurice
and I posted to Harwich, embarked in 

the pacquet-boat, and next day arrived at
Helveotsluys; from thence we repaired to the
Hague, in order to mingle in the gaieties of
the place, and exercise our talents at play,
which is there cultivated with universal eagerness:
but, chancing to meet with an old acquaintance,
whom I did not at all desire to see,
I found it convenient to withdraw softly to
Rotterdam; from whence we set out for Antwerp; 
and having made a tour of the Austrian
Nether-lands, set up our rest at Brussels, and
concerted a plan for laying the Flemings under
contribution. 
“From our appearance we procured admission
into the most polite assemblies, and
succeeded to a wonder in all our operations; 
until our career was unfortunately checked by
the indiscretion of my ally, who, being detected
in the very act of conveying a card, was immediately
introduced to a magistrate; and this
minister of justice was so curious, inquisitive,
and clear-sighted, that count Maurice, finding
it impossible to elude his penetration, was fain
to stipulate for his own safety, by giving up
his friend to the cognizance of the law. I was
accordingly apprehended, before I knew the
cause of my arrest: and being unhappily known
by some soldiers of the prince's guard, my character
turned out so little to the approbation
of the inquisitors, that all my effects were confiscated
for the benefit of the state, and I was
by a formal sentence condemned to labour on
the fortifications all the days of my life; while
Maurice escaped at the expence of five hundred
stripes, which he received in public from the
hands of the common executioner. 
“Thus have I, without evasion or mental 

reservation, given a faithful account of the
steps by which I have arrived at this barrier,
which is likely to be the ne plus ultra of my
peregrinations, unless the generous count de
Melvile will deign to interpose his interest in behalf
of a fellow-soldier, who may yet live to
justify his mediation.” 
Renaldo had no reason to doubt the truth
of this story, every circumstance of which
tended to corroborate the intelligence he had
already received touching the character of
Fathom, whom he now considered with a
double portion of abhorrence, as the most abandoned
miscreant that nature had ever produced. 
Though Ratchkali did not possess a much higher
place in his opinion, he favoured him with
marks of his bounty, and exhorted him, if possible,
to reform his heart; but he would by no
means promise to interpose his credit in favour
of a wretch self-convicted of such enormous
villainy and fraud. He could not help moralizing
upon this rencounter, which inspired
him with great contempt for human nature:
and next day he proceeded on his journey with
a heavy heart, ruminating on the perfidy of
mankind, and, between whiles, transported with
the prospect of revenging all his calamities upon
the accursed author. 
While he was wrapped up in these reveries,
his carriage rolled along, and had already entered
a wood between Mons and Tournay, when
his dream was suddenly interrupted by the explosion
of several pistols that were fired among
the thickets at a little distance from the road. 
Roused at this alarm, he snatched his sword
that stood by him, and springing from the chaise,
ran directly towards the spot, being close followed 

by his valet, who had alighted and armed
himself with a pistol in each hand. About forty
yards from the high way they arrived in a
little glade or opening, where they saw a single
man standing at bay against five banditti, after
having killed one of their companions, and lost
his own horse that lay dead upon the ground. 
Melvile seeing this odds, and immediately
guessing their design, rushed among them without
hesitation, and in an instant ran his sword
through the heart of one whose hand was raised
to smite the gentleman behind, while he was
engaged with the rest in front. At the same
time the valet disabled another by a shot in the
shoulder; so that the number being now equal
on both sides, a furious combat ensued, every
man being paired with an antagonist, and each
having recourse to swords, as all their pieces
had been discharged, Renaldo's adversary, finding
himself pressed with equal fury and skill,
retreated gradually among the trees, until he
vanished altogether into the thickest of the
wood; and his two companions followed his
example with great ease, the valet de chambre
being hurt in the leg, and the stranger so much
exhausted by the wounds he had received before
Renaldo's interposition, that when the
young gentleman approached to congratulate
him on the defeat of the robbers, he, in advancing
to embrace his deliverer, dropt down motionless
on the grass. 
The count, with that warmth of sympathy
and benevolence which was natural to his heart,
lifted up the wounded cavalier in his arms, and
carried him to the chaise, in which he was deposited,
while the valet de chambre reloaded
his pistols, and prepared for a second attack, as 

they did not doubt that the banditti would return
with a reinforcement.  However, before
they re-appeared, Renaldo's driver disengaged
him from the wood, and in less than a quarter
of an hour they arrived at a village, where they
halted for assistance to the stranger, who, tho'
still alive, had not recovered the use of his
senses. 
After he was undressed and laid in a warm
bed, a surgeon examined his body, and found
a wound in his neck by a sword, and another
in his right side occasioned by a pistol-shot; so
that his prognostic was very dubious: mean
while, he applied proper dressings to both; and,
in half an hour after this administration, the
gentleman gave some tokens of perception. 
He looked around him with a wildness of fury
in his aspect, as if he had thought himself in
the hands of the robbers by whom he had been
attacked: but, when he saw the assiduity with
which the by-standers exerted themselves in his
behalf, one raising his head from the pillow,
while another exhorted him to swallow a little
wine which was warmed for the purpose; when
he beheld the sympathising looks of all present,
and heard himself accosted in the most cordial
terms by the person whom he recollected as his
deliverer; all the severity vanished from his
countenance; he took Renaldo's hand and
pressed it to his lips; and while the tears gushed
from his eyes, “Praised be God,” said he,
“that virtue and generosity are still to be found
among the sons of men.” 
Every body in the apartment was affected by
this exclamation; and Melvile, above all the
rest, felt such emotions as he could scarcely restrain. 
He intreated the gentleman to believe 

himself in the midst of such friends as would
effectually secure him from all violence and
mortification; he conjured him to compose the
perturbation of his spirits, and quiet the apprehensions
of his mind with that reflection; and
protested, that he himself would not quit the
house while his attendance should be deemed
necessary for the stranger's cure, or his conversation
conducive to his amusement. 
These assurances, considered with the heroic
part which the young Hungarian had already
acted in his behalf, inspired the cavalier with
such a sublime idea of Melvile, that he gazed
upon him with silent astonishment, as an angel
sent from heaven for his succour; and in the
transport of his gratitude, could not help exclaiming,
“Sure providence hath still something
in reserve for this unfortunate wretch,
in whose favour such a miracle of courage and
generosity hath interposed!” 
Being accommodated with proper care and
attendance, his constitution in a little time overcame
the fever; and at the third dressing, the
surgeon declared him out of all danger from
his wounds. Then was Renaldo indulged with
opportunities of conversing with the patient,
and of inquiring into the particulars of his fortune
and designs in life, with a view to manifest
the inclination he felt to serve him in his future
occasions. 
The more this stranger contemplated the
character of the count, the more his amazement
increased, on account of his extraordinary
benevolence in favour of a person whose
merit he could not possibly know; he even expressed
his surprize on this subject to Renaldo,
who at length told him, that, although his best 

offices should always be ready for the occasions
of any gentleman in distress, his particular attachment
and regard to him was improved by
an additional consideration: “I am no stranger
(said he) to the virtues and honour of the
gallant Don Diego de Zelos.” 
“Heaven and earth!” cried the stranger,
starting from his seat with extreme emotion,
“do I then live to hear myself addressed by that
long lost appellation! my heart glows at the
expression! my spirits are kindled with a flame
that thrills through every nerve! Say, young
gentleman, if you are really an inhabitant of
earth, by what means are you acquainted with
the unhappy name of Zelos?” 
In answer to this eager intorrogation, Renaldo
gave him to understand, that in the course
of his travels, he had resided a short time at
Seville, where he had frequently seen Don Diego,
and often heard his character mentioned
with uncommon esteem and veneration. 
“Alas!” replied the Castilian, “that justice
is no longer done to the wretched Zelos; his
honours are blasted, and his reputation canker
bitten by the venomous tooth of slander.” 
He then proceeded to unfold his misfortunes,
as they have already been explained in the first
volume of these memoirs; at the recapitulation
of which, the heart of Melvile being intendered
by his own calamities, was so deeply affected,
that he re-echoed the groans of Don Diego,
and wept over his sufferings with the most
filial sympathy. When he repeated the story
of that cruel fraud, which was practised upon
him by the faithless Fadini, Melvile, whose
mind and imagination teemed with the villainies
of Fathom, was immediately struck with 

the conjecture of his being the knave; because,
indeed, he could not believe, that any other
person was so abandoned, by principle and humanity,
as to take such a barbarous advantage
of a gentleman in distress.
