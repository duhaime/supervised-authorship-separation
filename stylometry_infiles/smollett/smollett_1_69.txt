The longest and the last. 
The nature of this visit had softened
every heart, and saddened every countenance; 
and they walked in solemn silence to 

the other side of the church-yard, in order to
regain their carriages; when, at the turning
of the stile, they saw a young woman, in
wretched attire, running out of a poor habitation,
wringing her hands in all the agony of
despair. Notwithstanding the distraction in
her countenance, and the meanness of her
apparel, she discovered a regularity of features,
and a delicacy of air, which did not
at all correspond with the misery of her equipage. 
These exhibitions of extreme distress,
soon attracted the notice and compassion of
our company, and Melvile's beauteous help-mate,
accosting this forlorn damsel with a
pity-breathing aspect, asked the cause of her
disorder. 
“Alas! dear lady, cried the other, with
all the emphasis of woe, an unhappy gentleman
now breathes his last, within this inhospitable
hovel, amidst such excess of misery,
as would melt the most flinty bosom: what
then must I feel, who am connected with him
by the strongest ties of love and conjugal affection!” 
“Who is the unfortunate object?
said the physician.” “He was once well
known in the gay world (replied the young
woman); his name is Fathom.” Every individual
of the company started at mention of that
detested name. Serafina began to tremble
with emotion; and Renaldo, after a short
pause, declared he would go in, not with a
view to exult over his misery, but in order to
contemplate the catastrophe of such a wicked
life, that the moral might be the more deeply
engraved on his remembrance. The young
countess, whose tender heart could not bear
the shock of such a spectacle, retired to the
coach with madame Clement and the Jew, 

while Renaldo, accompanied by the rest, entered
a dismal apartment, altogether void of
furniture and convenience, where they beheld
the wretched hero of these memoirs, stretched
almost naked upon straw, insensible, convulsed,
and seemingly in the grasp of death. 
He was wore to the bone either by famine or
distemper; his face was overshadowed with
hair and filth; his eyes were sunk, glazed and
distorted; his nostrils dilated; his lips covered
with a black slough, and his complexion faded
into a pale clay-colour, tending to a yellow
hue: in a word, the extremity of indigence,
squalor and distress, could not be
more feelingly represented. 
While Melvile perused this melancholly lesson,
and groaning, cried, “Behold the fate
of man,” he perceived a letter in the right
hand of the unfortunate Fathom, which lay
fast clinched across his breast. Curious to
know the contents of this paper, which the
young woman said he had kept in that position
for several days, he drew nearer the
wretched couch, and was not a little surprized
to see it addressed to the right honourable Renaldo
count de Melvile, to the care of Mr.
Joshua Manasseh, merchant in London. 
When he attempted to disengage this billet
from the author's hand, the sorrowing female
fell on her knees, entreating him to desist, and
telling him, she had promised, upon oath, to
communicate the contents to no person upon
earth, but to carry the letter, upon her husband's
decease, to the gentleman to whose care
it was directed. 
Renaldo assured her upon his honour, that
he was the very Renaldo count de Melvile for
whom it was intended; and the young creature 

was so much confounded at this information,
that before she could recollect herself,
Melvile had opened the billet and read these
words. “If this paper should fall into the
hands of the noble Renaldo, he will understand
that Fathom was the most execrable traitor
that ever imposed upon unsuspecting benevolence,
or attempted to betray a generous
benefactor. His whole life was a series of fraud,
perfidy, and the most abominable ingratitude:
but of all the crimes that lay heavy upon his
soul, his being accessory to the death of the
incomparable Serafina, whose father he had
also robbed, was that, for which he despaired
of heaven's forgiveness, notwithstanding the
dreadful compunction and remorse which have
long preyed upon his heart, together with the
incredible misery and deplorable death which
by this time he hath undergone. Tho' these
sufferings and sorrows cannot attone for his
enormous guilt, perhaps they will excite the
compassion of the humane count de Melvile:
at least, this confession which my conscience
dictates under all the terrors of death and futurity,
may be a warning for him to avoid
henceforth a smiling villain, like the execrable
Fathom, upon whose miserable soul almighty
God have mercy.” 
Renaldo was deeply affected with the contents
of this scroll, which denoted such horror
and despair. He saw there could be no dissimilation
of sinister design in this profession
of penitence: he beheld the condition of the
writer, which put all his humane passions in
commotion; so that he remembered nothing
of Fathom but his present distress. He could
scarce contain those indications which might
have been justly deemed the effect of weakness 

and infirmity; and having desired the physician
and clergyman to contribute their assistance
for the benefit of that wretch's soul and
body, he ran to the coach, and communicated
the letter to the ladies; at the same time drawing
a picture of the object he had seen, which
brought tears into the eyes of the gentle Serafina,
who earnestly entreated her lord to use
his endeavours for the relief and recovery of
the unhappy man; that he might, if possible,
live to enjoy the benefit of mature repentance,
and not die in that dreadful despair which he
manifested in the letter. 
Renaldo returning to the house, found the
pious clergyman reading prayers with great
fervency; while don Diego stood with his
right hand upon his breast, looking stedfastly
upon the agonizing Fathom, and the young
woman kneeled with her streaming eyes lifted
up to heaven, in an extacy of grief and devotion:
the physician had run to an apothecary's
shop in the neighbourhood, from whence he
soon returned with an assistant, who applied a
large blister to the back of the miserable patient,
while the female, by the doctor's direction,
moistened his mouth with a cordial
which he had prescribed. 
These charitable steps being taken, Count de
Melvile intreated the apothecary's servant to
procure a tent bed for the accommodation of
the sick person, with all imaginable dispatch; 
and in less than an hour, one was actually pitched,
and Fathom lifted into it, after he had
been shifted, and in some measure purified
from the dregs of his indigence. During this
transaction the ladies were conducted to a
tavern not far off, where dinner was bespoke,
that they might be at hand to see the effect of 

their charity; which was not confined to
what we have already described, but extended
so far, that in a little time, the apartment was
comfortably furnished, and the young creature
provided with change of apparel, and
money to procure the necessaries of subsistence. 
Notwithstanding all their care, the wretched
Fathom still remained insensible, and the
doctor pronounced a very unfavourable prognostic,
while he ordered a pair of additional
vesicatories to be laid upon his arms, and other
proper medicines to be administred. After
dinner, the ladies ventured to visit the place,
and when Serafina crossed the threshold, the
weeping female fell at her feet, and kissing her
robe, exclaimed, “Sure you are an angel
from heaven!” 
The alteration in her dress had made a very
agreeable change in her appearance, so that
the countess could now look upon her, without
shuddering at her distress: and as Fathom
was not in a condition to be disturbed, she
took this opportunity of inquiring by what
steps that unfortunate wretch was conveyed
from the prison, in which she knew he had
been confined, to the place where he now lay
in such extremity; and by what occurrence
he had found a wife in such an abyss of misfortune. 
Here the other's tears began to flow
afresh. “I am ashamed (said she) to reveal
my own folly; yet I dare not refuse a satisfaction
of this kind, to a person who has laid
me under such signal obligations.” 
She then proceeded to relate her story, by
which it appeared, she was no other than the
fair and unhappy Elinor, whom the artful
Fathom had debauched upon his first arrival in
town, in the manner already described in these 

memoirs. “Heaven, continued she, was pleased
to restore the use of my reason which I had
lost, when I found myself abandoned by the
count; but, all my connexion with my own family
being entirely cut off, and every door shut
against a poor creature, who could procure no
recommendation, except the certificate signed
by the physician of bedlam, which instead of
introducing me to service, was an unsurmountable
objection to my character: I found myself
destitute of all means of subsistng, unless I would
condescend to live the infamous and wretched
life of a courtezan, an expedient rendered palatable
by the terrors of want co operating with
the reflection of the irretrievable loss I had
already sustained. I ask pardon for offending
your chaste ears with this impure confession of
my guilt, which heaven knows, I then did, and
now do look upon with abhorrence and detestation. 
I had already forfeited my innocence,
and wanted resolution to encounter misery
and death. Nevertheless, before I could
determine to embrace the condition of a prostitute,
I was one day accosted in the park by
an elderly gentleman who sat down by me upon
a bench, and taking notice of the despondence
which was evident in my countenance,
pressed me to make him acquainted with
the nature of my misfortune. So much sympathy
and good sense appeared in his deportment
and conversation, that I gratified his request,
and he, in return for my confidence,
saved me from the most horrible part of my
prospect, by taking me into his protection, and
reserving me for his own appetite. In this situation
I lived a whole year, until I was deprived
of my keeper by an apoplectic fit, and turned
out of doors by his relations, who did not, 

however, strip me of the cloaths and moveables
which I owed to his bounty. Far from being
as yet reconciled to a vitious life, I resolved to
renounce the paths of shame, and converting
my effects into ready money, hired a small
shop, and furnished it with haberdashery ware,
intending to earn an honest livelihood by the
sale of these commodities, together with the
plain-work in which I hoped to be employed,
so soon as my talents should be known. But
this scheme did not answer my expectation. 
The goods spoiled upon my hands, and as I
was a stranger in the neighbourhood, no body
would intrust me with any other business; so
that notwithstanding the most parsimonious
oeconomy, I ran in debt to my landlord, who
seized my effects; and an hosier from whom I
had received some parcels upon credit, took
out a writ against me, by virtue of which I was
arrested and imprisoned in the Marshalsea,
where I found my first seducer. Good heaven!
what did I feel at this unexpected meeting,
overwhelmed as I was before, with my own
distress! I with a loud scream fainted away; 
and when I recovered, found myself in the arms
of Mr Fathom, who wept over me with great
affliction. All his prospects of gaiety had now
vanished, and his heart was softened by his own
misfortunes, to a feeling of another's woe, as
well as to a due sense of his own guilt. He
expressed the deepest sorrow for having been
the occasion of my ruin, endeavour'd to comfort
me with promise of assistance, and indeed, by
practising medicine among the prisoners, made
shift to keep us both from starving. But surely
no sinner underwent such severe remorse, as
that which he suffered during his imprisonment. 
From the day of our meeting, I never once saw 

him smile: a melancholy cloud continually
overhung his countenance. He numbered the
minutes by his groans, he used to start with
horrour from his sleep, and striking his breast,
would exclaim, “O Elinor! I am the worst of
villains!” Sometimes he seemed disordered in his
brain, and raved about Renaldo and Monimia:
in a word, his mind was in a dreadful situation,
and all his agonies were communicated to me,
whom by this time he had married, in order
to make some attonement for my wrongs. 
Wretched as he then was, I remembered the
accomplished youth who had captivated my
virgin heart: The old impressions still remained. 
I saw his penitence, pitied his misfortune: and
his wife being dead, consented to join his fate,
the ceremony having been performed by a
fellow-prisoner, who was in orders. Though
his hard-hearted creditor had no other chance
of being payed, than that of setting him at liberty,
he lent a deaf ear to all our supplications; 
and his cruelty conspiring with the anguish of
my husband's own reflection, affected his health
and spirits to such a degree, that he could no
longer earn the miserable pittance which had
hitherto supported our lives. Then our calamities
began to multiply. Indigence and famine
stared us in the face; and it was with
the utmost difficulty that we resisted their attacks
by selling or pledging our wearing apparel, until
we were left almost quite naked, when we
found ourselves discharged by an act passed for
the relief of insolvent debtors. This charitable
law, which was intended for a consolation to
the wretched, proved to us the most sever disaster:
for, we were turned out into the streets,
utterly distitute of food, raiment and lodging; 
at a time when Mr. Fathom was so weakened 

by his destemper, that he could not stand alone. I supported him from door to door, imploring
the compassion of charitable christians, and was
as length permitted to shelter him in this miserable
place, where his disease gaining ground,
he lay three days in that deplorable condition,
from which he hath now been rescued (tho'
I fear too late) by your humanity and benevolence.” 
She shed a flood of tears at the conclusion
of this mournful tale, which did not fail to
affect the whole audience, especially Serafina,
who assured her, that whatever should happen
to her husband, she might depend upon
finding favour and protection, provided her
conduct should correspond with her professions. 
While this grateful creature kissed the
hand of her kind benefactress, Fathom uttered
a groan, began to stir in the bed, and with
a languid voice called upon Elinor, who instantly
withdrawing the curtain, presented the
whole company to his view. He had now retrieved
the use of his perception, by the operation
of the blisters which began to torture
him severely; he looked around him with
amazement and affright, and distinguishing
the three persons against whom the chief arrows
of his fraud and treachery had been levelled,
he concluded that he was now arrived
at the land of departed souls, and that the
shades of those whom he had so grievously
injured, were come to see him tormented according
to his demerits. 
Fraught with this notion, which was confirmed
by the bodily pain which he felt, and
the appearance of the clergyman and Joshua
whom he mistook for the ministers of vengeance,
he cried in a tone replete with horror, 

“Is there no mercy then for penitence!
is there no pity due to the miseries I suffered
upon earth! save me, O bountiful heaven!
from the terrors of everlasting woe; hide me
from these dreadful executioners, whose looks
are torture: forgive me, generous Castilian. 
O Renaldo! thou hadst once a tender heart. 
I dare not lift my eyes to Serafina! that pattern
of human excellence, who fell a victim to
my attrocious guilt; yet, her aspect is all
mildness and compassion. Ha! are not these
the drops of pity? yes, they are tears of mercy:
they fall like refreshing showers upon my
drooping soul! ah murthered innocence!
wilt thou not intercede for thy betrayer at the
throne of grace!” 
Here he was interrupted by Melvile, who with
a grave and solemn air, pronounced, “Great
hath been thy guilt, unhappy Ferdinand, and
great have been thy sufferings. Yet, we
come not to insult, but to alleviate thy distress. 
Providence hath kindly defeated thy dire intentions,
which we therefore now forgive and
transmit to oblivion, whether it be thy lot to
yield up thy spirit immediately, or to survive
the dangerous malady with which thou art at
at present overwhelmed. Suffer not thyself to
despair; for the mercy of heaven is infinite; 
and submit to the directions of this worthy
gentleman who will employ his skill for thy
recovery, while we shall take care to furnish
thee with necessary attendance: as too much
speaking may be prejudicial to thy health, I
dispense with a reply, and exhort thee to
compose thyself to rest.” So saying, he drew
the curtain, and the company retired, leaving
Fathom intranced with wonder. 
The next step which Renaldo took for the 

benefit of this wretched penitent, was to send
for the apothecary with whom he left a sum
of money to be expended for the convenience
of Fathom and his wife; then he laid injunctions
upon the physician to repeat his visits; 
and that gentleman, together with the clergyman
and Joshua, taking leave of the others
till next day, the count set out with the ladies
and his father-in-law, to the house where they
had lodged the preceding night. 
The reader may well imagine the conversation
of the evening turned wholly upon the
strange occurrence of the day, which seemed
to have been concerted by supernatural prescience,
in order to satisfy the vengeance, and
afford matter of triumph to the generosity of
those who had been so grievously injured by
the guilty Fathom. Tho' not one of them
would say that such a miscreant ought to live; 
yet all concurred in approving the offices of
humanity which had been performed, and even
endeavoured to find specious pretexts for vindicating
their compassion. Don Diego said it
would ill become a transgressor like him, to
with-hold his forgiveness from a sinner who
had wrong'd him: Madame Clement appealed
to the approbation of heaven, which had undoubtedly
directed them that way, for the
purpose they had fulfilled; Serafina observed
that the crimes of the delinquent were obliterated
by his sorrow, misery and repentance: 
Renaldo honestly owned, that, exclusive of
other reasons, he could not deny himself the
luxurious enjoyment of communicating happiness
to his fellow creatures in distress; and
each fervently prayed that their charity might
not be disappointed by the death of the object. 
While they amused themselves in these discussions, 

Fathom, after having lain some hours
silent, in consequence of Renaldo's advice,
could no longer suppress the astonishment of
his mind, but, addressing himself to his wife,
“O Elinor! (said he) my delirium is now
past: tho' I still remember the phantasies of
my distemper'd brain: among other reveries,
my imagination was regaled with a vision so
perfect and distinct, as to emulate truth and
reality. Methought count de Melvil, don
Diego de Zelos, and the divine Serafina, the
very persons who are now crying before the
throne of heaven for vengeance against the
guilty Fathom, stood by my bed-side, with
looks of pity and forgiveness; and that Renaldo
spoke peace to my despairing soul. I
heard the words distinctly: I retain them in
my memory. I saw the tears trickle from Serafina's
eyes: I heard her father utter a compassionate
sigh; and should actually believe
that they were personally present, had not I
long ago seen with my own eyes, the funeral
procession of that young lady whose wrongs
God pardon; and were I not convinced that
such a meeting could not be effected without
the immediate and miraculous interposition of
heaven. Yet every thing I now see, corresponds
with the words of Renaldo, which still
sound in my ears. When my perception forsook
me, I lay in the most abject misery, among
straw; and thou, poor injured innocence,
wast naked and forlorn. Now, I find
myself reposed in a warm easy comfortable
bed: I see around me the marks of human
charity and care, and the favourable change
in thy appearance glads my poor dejected
heart. Say, whence this happy alteration? 
Do I really wake from that dream of misery 

in which we have continued so long? or do
still utter the extravagant ravings of a distemper'd
brain?” 
Elinor was afraid of imparting at once all
the particulars of the happy change he had
undergone, lest they might leave a dangerous
impression upon his fancy, which was not yet
duly composed: she contented herself, therefore,
with telling him that he had been obliged
to the humanity of a gentleman and lady,
who chanced to pass that way by accident,
and who, understanding his deplorable
case, had furnished him with the conveniencies
which he now enjoyed: she then presented to
him, what the doctor had directed her to administer,
and admonishing him to commit his
head to the pillow, he was favoured with a
breathing sweat, fell fast asleep, and in a few
hours waked again altogether cool and undisturbed. 
It was upon this occasion that his wife explained
the circumstances of that visit which
had redeemed him from extremity of wretchedness
and the jaws of death; upon which,
he started up, and throwing himself upon his
knees, exclaimed, “All gracious power!
this was the work of thy own bounteous
hand; the voice of my sorrow and repentance
hath been heard. Thou hast inspired my benefactors with more than mortal goodness, in
my behalf; how shall I praise thy name!
how shall I requite their generosity! O I am
bankrupt to both! yet, let me not perish until
I shall have convinced them of my reformation,
and seen them enjoying that felicity
which ought to be reserved for such consummate
virtue.” 
Next day in the forenoon, he was visited by 

the physician, whom he now recollected to
have seen at the house of madame Clement; 
and after having thanked that gentleman for
his humanity and care, he earnestly begged to
know by what means Serafina had been preserved. 
When he was satisfied in this particular,
and given to understand that she was
now happy in the arms of Renaldo, “Blessed
be God! (he cried) for having defeated the
villainy of him who sought to part such lovers. 
Dear Sir, will you add one circumstance to
your charity, and bear to that happy couple
and the noble don Diego, the respects and the
remorse of a sincere penitent, whom their
compassion hath raised to life. I have been
such a traitor to them, that my words deserve
no regard. I will not therefore use professions. 
I dare not hope to be admitted into
their presence. I am indeed ashamed to see
the light of the sun: how then could I bear
the looks of that injured family! ah, no! let
me hide myself in some obscure retreat, where
I may work out my salvation with fear and
trembling, and pray incessantly to heaven for
their prosperity.” 
The physician promised to represent his
contrition to the count and his lady, and accordingly
proceeded to their habitation, where
he repeated these expressions, and pronounced
his patient out of danger; so that their
thoughts were now employed in concerting a
scheme for his future subsistence, that he
might not be exposed by indigence to a relapse
in point of morals. Renaldo being still averse
to any personal intercourse with such a wretch,
until he should give some undoubted proofs
of amendment, and as yet afraid of intrusting
him with any office that required integrity, 

resolved, with the approbation of all present,
to settle him in a cheap country in the north
of England, where he and his wife could live
comfortably on an annuity of sixty pounds,
until his behaviour should intitle him to a
better provision. 
This resolution was just taken, when Joshua
arrived with a gentleman whom he introduced
to don Diego as the secretary of the Spanish
ambassador. After the first compliments,
this stranger told the Castilian, that he waited
upon him at the desire of his excellency, who
would have come in person, had he not been
confined by the gout; then he put into his
hand, a letter from the court of Madrid,
written by a nobleman of Diego's acquaintance,
who informed him that don Manuel
de Mendoza having made away with himself by
poison, in order to avoid the disgrace of a
legal conviction, his catholic Majesty was now
convinced of don Diego's innocence, and
granted him leave to return and take possession
of his honours and estate. This information
was confirmed by the secretary, who
assured him that the ambassador had orders
to make him acquainted with this favourable
decision of the king. The Castilian having
first acquitted himself in the most polite terms
to the secretary and the Jew, who, he said,
had always been a messenger of glad tidings,
communicated his happiness to the company; 
and this evening concluded the third day of
their rejoicing. 
Next morning, don Diego went to visit the
ambassador, accompanied by Joshua and the
secretary; while the physician repairing to the
habitation of Fathom, signified, by Renaldo's
direction, the resolution which had been 

taken in his behalf; and the patient no sooner
heard his doom, than lifting up his hands,
he cried, “I am unworthy of such tenderness
and benevolence:” while Elinor shed a flood
of tears in silence, unable to give utterance to
her grateful thought: Melville's bounty having
so far transcended her most sanguine
hope. 
The Spaniard having paid his devoirs to his
excellency, returned before dinner; and, in
the afternoon, desiring a private conference
with Serafina, they retired into another apartment,
and he expressed himself to this
effect: “You have contracted, my dear
child, an habit of calling madame Clement
your mother, and doubtless, by her maternal
tenderness and regard, she hath acquired a
just title to the appellation: yet, I own, I
would fain strengthen it by a legal claim. I no
sooner retrieved my daughter, than I gave her
away to the most deserving youth that ever
sighed with love. I rejoice in the gift which
secured your happiness: but I left myself in a
solitary situation, which even the return of my
good fortune cannot render easy and supportable. 
When I revisit the castle of Zelos,
every well known object will recal the memory
of my Antonia, and I shall want a companion
to fill her place, and to sympathize with
me in that sorrow which will be derived from
my remembrance. Who is there so worthy
to succeed your mother in the affection of don
Diego, as she who interests her love for Serafina,
and resembles her so strongly in every
virtue of the sex? similar attractions will
produce similar effects. My heart is already
attached to that good lady; and, provided 

Serafina shall approve of my choice, I will
lay myself and fortune at her feet.” 
The fair countess replied with an enchanting
smile, that, before this declaration, she had
with pleasure perceived the progress which
madame Clement had made in his heart; and
that she did not believe there was a person
upon earth better qualified to repair the loss
he had sustained; tho' she foresaw one obstacle
to his happiness, which she was afraid
would not be easily surmounted. “You
mean,” answered the Castilian, “the difference
of religion, which I am resolved to remove
by adopting the protestant faith; though
I am fully satisfied that real goodness is of no
particular persuasion, and that salvation cannot
depend upon belief, over which the will
has no influence. I invest you therefore with
the charge of declaring my passion and proposal,
and impower you to satisfy her scruples
with regard to the religion which I now profess; 
and which I shall not openly relinquish,
until I shall have secured in this country, effects
sufficient to screen me from the ill consequences
of my king's displeasure.” 
Serafina undertook this office with pleasure,
because she had reason to think his addresses
would not be disagreeable to madame Clement; 
and that same night made the count acquainted
with the nature of her commission. Nor
was her expectation disappointed: the French
lady, with that frankness which is peculiar to
virtue and good breeding, confessed that don
Diego was not indifferent to her choice, and
did not hesitate in receiving him upon the
footing of a lover. As we have already dwelt
circumstantially on the passion of love, so as
perhaps even to have tired our readers, we 

shall not repeat the dialogue that passed, when
the Spaniard was indulged with an opportunity
to explain his sentiments. Suffice it to observe,
that the lady's days of coquetry were now over,
and that she was too wise to trifle with the time
which every moment became more and more
precious. It was agreed then, that don Diego
should settle his affairs in Spain, and return to
England, in order to espouse madame Clement,
with a view to fix his residence in this island,
where Renaldo likewise proposed to enjoy the
sweets of his fortune, provided he could draw
hither his interests and connexions. 
Mean while, having for some days days enjoyed
his bliss with all the fulness of rapture,
amidst this small but agreeable society, he shifted
the scene, and conducted his dear partner
to a ready furnished house in town, which together
with an occasional equipage, his friend
Joshua had hired for the accommodation of
him and his father in law, who, during his stay
in England, failed not to cultivate the mistress
of his heart, with the most punctual assiduity. 
Hitherto Serafina had been as a precious jewel
locked up in a casket, which the owner alone
has an opportunity to contemplate: but now
the count who was proud of such a prize, resolved
to let her shine forth to the admiration
of the whole world, With this view, he bespoke
such ornaments as befitted her quality,
and while the mantua-makers were employed
in her service, made a tour among his former
acquaintance, and discharged the obligations
under which he lay to some who had assisted
him in his distress. He did not, however, introduce
them to his charming Serafina: because
not one of them had formerly treated
her with that delicacy of regard which he 

thought her due; and some of them were
much mortified at their neglect, when they saw
what a dazzling figure she made in the beau
monde. 
She was visited by the Spanish and Imperial
ambassadors, and divers other foreigners of
distinction, to whom Melvile had letters of recommendation:
but her first public appearance
was in a box at the opera, accompanied by
by madame Clement, the count and don Diego:
the entertainment was already begun, so that
her entrance had the greater effect upon the
audience, whose attention was soon detached
from the performance, and rivetted upon this
amiable apparition, which seemed to be some
bright being of another world dropt from the
clouds among them. Then did the spirit of
curiosity play its part: a thousand whispers circulated; 
as many glasses were exalted to reconnoitre
this box of foreigners; for such
they concluded them to be from their appearance. 
Every male spectator acknowledged
Serafina to be the paragon of beauty; and
every female confessed, that Melvile was the
model of a fine gentleman. The charms of the
young countess did not escape the eye and approbation
of royalty itself; and when her rank
was known, from the information of the ambassadors
and other people of condition who
were seen saluting her at a distance, that same
evening a thousand bumpers were swallowed in
honour of the countess de Melville. The fame
of her beauty was immediately extended over
this immense metropolis, and different schemes
were concerted for bringing her into life. These
however she resisted with unwearied obstinacy. 
Her happiness centered in Renaldo, and the cultivation
of a few friends within the shade of 

domestic quiet! she did not even forget the
concerns of the wretched Fathom and his faithful
Elinor, who daily enjoyed fresh instances
of her humanity and care; when his fever forsook
him, he was supplied with nourishing food
for the recovery of his healty; and soon as he
foound himself in a condition to travel, he
gave notice to his benefactor, who desired
Joshua to settle with him the manner in which
he was to receive his allowance, and to pay the
first half year's salary per advance. 
This affair being adjusted, and the place of
his retreat signified, the Jew told Elinor, that
she might wait upon the countess before their
departure; and she did not fail to make use of
this permission. After they had made the necessary
preparations for their journey, and taken
places in the York stage-coach, Mrs Fathom
cloathing herself in decent apparel, went to
the house of count Melvile, and was immediately
admitted to the presence of Serafina, who
received her with her usual complacency, enriched
her with salutary advice, comforted her
with hope of better things, provided her conduct
and that of her husband's should henceforth be
found irreproachable; and wishing her peace
and happiness, presented her with a box of
linen; and twenty guineas in a purse. Such
excessive goodness overpowered this sensible
young woman to such a degree, that she stood
before her in speechless awe and veneration; 
and the countess, in order to relieve her from
the confusion under which she suffered, quitted
the room, leaving her to the care of her
woman. It was not long, however, before her
gratitude broke out in loud exclamations and a
violent passion of tears, which all her efforts
could not, for a good while, overcome. By 

this time the coach was brought up to the
gate, for the reception of Serafina, who took
an airing every day at the same hour; when
Renaldo, leading her to the vehicle, beheld a
man plainly dressed standing within the court,
with his head and body bent towards the earth,
so that his countenance could not be perceived. 
Melvile, who supposed him to be some unfortunate
man come to implore his charity,
turned towards him, and asked, with a humane
accent, if he wanted to speak with any person
in the house? To this interrogation the stranger
replied, without lifting up his head, “ Overwhelmed
as I am with count Melvile's generosity,
together with a consciousness of my own
unworthiness, it ill becomes a wretch like me
to importune him for futher favour; yet I
could not bear the thought of withdrawing
(perhaps for ever) from the presence of my
benefactor, without solliciting his permission
to see his face in mercy, to acknowledge my attrocious
crimes, to hear my pardon confirmed
by his voice, and that of his accomplished countess,
whom I dare not even at a distance behold; 
and to express my fervent wish for their prosperity.” 
Melvile, whose heart was but too tender,
could not hear this address without emotion:
he recognized the companion of his infancy
and youth; he remembered the happy scenes he
had enjoyed with Fathom, whose voice had always
such an effect upon his ear, as to excite
the ideas of friendship and esteem; and he
was disturbed by this unexpected meeting,
which also discomposed the beauteous Serafina. 
Renaldo having paused a little, “It is
with pain,” said he, “I recollect any thing to
the prejudice of Fathom, whose future behaviour 

will, I hope, eraze the memory of his
offences, and justify what other steps I may
take in his favour. Mean while I heartily forgive
what is past; and, in token of my sincerity,
present my hand;” which our adventurer
bathed with his tears. The countess, whose
mind was unison with her husband, repeated
her assurances of pardon and protection; at
which the penitent rejoiced in silence, while
he raised his head, and took a parting view of
those charms which had formerly enslaved his
heart. 
Having thus obeyed the dictates of his duty
and inclination, he next morning embarked
in the stage-coach, with his faithful Elinor,
and in six days arrived at the place of his retreat,
which he found extremely well adapted
to the circumstances of his mind and fortune:
for all his vice and ambition was now quite
mortified within him, and his whole attention
engrossed in attoning for his former crimes,
by a sober and penitent life, by which alone he
could deserve the uncommon generosity of his
patrons. 
While he thus accommodated himself to his
new system, Renaldo received letters of congratulation
from his sister, who with the major
had come to Brussels, in order to meet her
brother and Serafina, according to his proposal. 
This intimation being communicated to
don Diego, he resolved to accompany them to
Flanders, in his way to Spain. Preparations
were made for their departure; the clergyman
and physician were honoured with valuable
marks of friendship and esteem from the
countess, Renaldo, and the Castilian, who
were convoyed to Deal by madame Clement,
to whom, at parting, don Diego presented a 

diamond ring, as a pledge of his inviolable
love. 
Here the travellers hired a vessel for Ostend,
which they reached in a few hours; in two
days more they arrived at Brussels, where Mrs
Farrel and her husband were struck with admiration
at the surprizing beauty and accomplishment
of their sister-in-law, whom they
caressed with equal tenderness and joy. —In a
word all parties were as happy as good fortune
could make them; and don Diego set
out for Spain, after they had agreed to reside
in the Low Countries till his return.
