The conjurer and his associate execute a plan of vengeance
against certain infidels who pretend to despise
their art; and Peregrine atchieves an adventure
with a young nobleman. 
By these means, the whole variety of character
undisguised, passed as it were in review
before the confederates, who, by divers ingenious
contrivances, punished the most flagrant
offenders with as much severity as the nature of
their plan would allow. At length, they projected
a scheme for chastising a number of their
own acquaintance, who had all along professed
the utmost contempt for the talents of this conjurer,
which they endeavoured to ridicule in all
companies, where his surprising art was the subject
of discourse; not that they had sense and discernment
enough to perceive the absurdity of his
pretensions, but affected a singularity of opinion,
with a view of insulting the inferior understandings
of those who were deceived by such an idle impostor. 

Peregrine indeed, for obvious reasons, had always
espoused their judgment in this case, and
joined them in reviling the public character of
his friend; but he knew how far the capacities of
those virtuosi extended, and had frequently caught
them in the fact of recounting their exploits
against the conjurer, which were the productions
of their own invention only. On these considerations,
his wrath was kindled against them, and
he accordingly concerted measures with his coadjutor,
for overwhelming them with confusion and
dismay. 
In the first place, a report was spread by his
emissaries, that the magician had undertaken to
entertain the view with the appearance of any
person whom his customers should desire to see,
whether dead, or at the distance of a thousand
leagues. This extraordinary proposal chancing
to be the subject of conversation, in a place where
most of those infidels were assembled, they talked
of it in the usual stile, and some of them swore,
the fellow ought to be pillory'd for his presumption. 
Our hero seizing this favourable opportunity,
acquiesced in their remarks, and observed with
great vehemence, that it would be a meritorious
action to put the rascal to the proof, and then
toss him in a blanket for non-performance. They
were wonderfully pleased with this suggestion,
and forthwith determined to try the experiment; 
though, as they understood the apparition would
be produced to one only at a time, they could
not immediately agree in the choice of the person
who should stand the first brunt of the magician's
skill. While each of them severally excused
himself from this preference on various pretences, 

Peregrine readily undertook the post, expressing
great confidence of the conjurer's incapacity to
give him the least cause of apprehension. 
This point being settled, they detached one of
their number to Crabtree, in order to bespeak
and adjust the hours and terms of the operation,
which he insisted upon performing at his own
apartment, where every thing was prepared for
the occasion. At the appointed time, they went
thither in a body, to the number of seven, in full
expectation of detecting the impostor; and were
received with such gloomy formality, as seemed
to have an effect upon the countenances of some
among them; though they were encouraged by
the vivacity of Pickle, who affected a double
share of petulance, for the more effectual accomplishment
of his purpose. 
Cadwallader made no reply to the interrogations
they uttered, in the levity of their insolence,
at their first entrance, but ordered Hadgi to conduct
them through the next room, that they
might see there was no previous apparatus to affright
their deputy with objects foreign to his undertaking. 
They found nothing but a couple of
wax-tapers burning on a table that stood with a
chair by it, in the middle of the apartment, and
returned to the audience-chamber, leaving Peregrine
by himself, to encounter the phantom of
that person, whom they should (without his
knowledge) desire the magician to conjure up to
his view. 
All the doors being shut, and the company
seated, a profound silence ensued, together with
a face of dreadful expectation, encouraged by
the blue flame of the candles, which were tipt
with sulphur for that purpose, and heightened by 

the dismal sound of a large bell, which Hadgi
tolled in the anti-chamber. Cadwallader having
thus practised upon their ignorance and fear, desired
them to name the person to be produced; 
and after some whispers among themselves, one
of them took the pen, and writing the name of
commodore Trunnion upon a slip of paper, put
it into the hands of the magician, who rose from
his seat, and opening the door of his closet, displayed
to their view a scull, with thigh-bones
crossed upon a table covered with black cloth. 
This melancholy spectacle made a remarkable
impression upon the imaginations of the company,
already prepossessed by the previous ceremony; 
and they began to survey one another
with looks of consternation, while Cadwallader
shutting himself in the closet, that was contiguous
to the chamber in which his friend Peregrine was
stationed, thrust the label with his uncle's name
through a small chink in the partition, according
to agreement, muttering all the time a sort of
gibberish, that increased the pannic of his audience; 
then returning to his chair, the knell
was knolled again, and Pickle called aloud,
“Damn your mummery, why don't you dispatch?” 
This was a signal to Crabtree, who thus certified
of his having received the paper, stood up
and waved his wand in the figure of an S. The
motion being thrice performed, their ears were all
of a sudden invaded by a terrible noise in the next
room, accompanied with the voice of Peregrine,
who exclaimed in a tone of horror and amazement,
“Guard me, heaven! my uncle Trunnion!” 
This ejaculation had such an effect upon
the hearers, that two of them swooned with 

fear, a third fell upon his knees, and prayed
aloud, while the other three, in a transport of
dismay and distraction, burst open the door, and
rushed into the haunted chamber, where they
found the table and chair overturned, and Peregrine
extended (in all appearance) without sense
or motion, upon the floor. 
They immediately began to chase his temples,
and the first symptom of his recovery, which
they perceived, was an hollow groan; after which,
he pronounced these words: “Merciful powers!
if I live, I saw the commodore with his black
patch, in the very cloaths he wore at my sister's
wedding.” This declaration compleated their
astonishment and terror; they observed a wildness
in his looks, which he seemed to bend on
something concealed from their view; and were
infected by his appearance to such a pitch of superstition,
that it would have been an easy matter
to persuade them, that the chair and table were
apparitions of their forefathers. However, they
conducted Peregrine into the council chamber,
where the conjurer and Hadgi were employed in
ministring to those who had fainted: and the patients
having retrieved the use of their faculties,
Cadwallader assuming a double portion of severity
in his aspect, asked if they were not ashamed of
their former incredulity; declaring, that he was
ready to give them more convincing proofs of his
art upon the spot, and would immediately recal
three generations of their progenitors from the
dead, if they were disposed to relish such company. 
Then turning to one of them, whose
great grandfather had been hanged, “Are you
(said he) ambitious of seeing the first remarkable
personage of your family? Say the word; and
he shall appear.” 

This youth, who had been the most insolent
and obstreperous of the whole society, and was
now depressed with the same proportion of fear,
alarmed at the proposal, assured the magician, he
had no curiosity of that sort remaining; and that,
what he had already seen, would (he hoped)
have a good effect upon his future life and conversation. 
Every one of these heroes made an
acknowledgment and profession of the same kind,
some of which were attended with tears; and
Hadgi having provided chairs for the whole company,
they departed exceedingly crest-fallen; and
two of the number actually sickened with the
agitation they had undergone, while our hero and
his associate made themselves merry with the success
of their enterprize. 
But this scheme of fortune-telling did not engross
his whole attention; he still continued to
maintain his appearance in the beau monde; and
as his expence far exceeded his income, strove to
contract intimacies with people of interest and
power: he shewed himself regularly at court,
paid his respects to them in all places of public diversion,
and frequently entered into their parties,
either of pleasure or cards. In the course of this
cultivation, he happened one evening, at a certain
chocolate-house, to overlook a match at
piquet, in which he perceived a couple of sharpers
making prey of a young nobleman, who had neither
temper nor skill sufficient to cope with such
antagonists. 
Our hero being a professed enemy to all
knights of industry, could not bear to see them
cheat in publick with such insolent audacity; and
therefore, under pretence of communicating some
business of importance, he begg'd the favour of 

speaking to the young gentleman in another corner
of the room, and in a friendly manner cautioned
him against the arts of his opponents. 
This hot-headed representative, far from thinking
or owning himself obliged to Pickle for his good
counsel, looked upon the advice as an insult upon
his understanding; and replied with an air of ferocious
displeasure, that he knew how to take
care of his own concerns, and would not suffer
either him or them to bubble him out of one
shilling. 
Peregrine, offended at the association, as well
as at the ingratitude and folly of this conceited
coxcomb, expressed his resentment, by telling
him, that he expected at least an acknowledgement
for his candid intention; but he found his
intellects too much warped by his vanity, to perceive
his own want of capacity and experience. 
Inflamed by this reproof, the young nobleman
challenged him to play for five hundred pounds,
with many opprobrious, or at least contemptuous
terms of defiance, which provoked our hero to
accept the proposal; and after the other had disengaged
himself from the old rooks, who were
extremely mortified at the interruption, the two
young champions sat down, and fortune acting
with uncommon impartiality, Pickle, by the superiority
of his talents, in two hours won to the
amount of as many thousand pounds, for which
he was obliged to take his antagonist's note, the
sharpers having previously secured his ready money. 
Frantic with his loss, the rash young man
would have continued the game, and doubled
stakes every time; so that Peregrine might have
increased his acquisition to ten times the sum he
had gained; but he thought he had already sufficiently 

chastised the presumption of the challenger,
and was unwilling to impower fortune to
ravish from him the fruits of his success: he
therefore declined my lord's proposal, unless he
would play for ready money; and his lordship
having in vain tried his credit among the company,
our adventurer withdrew, leaving him in
an extasy of rage and disappointment. 
As the insolence of his behaviour had increased
with his ill luck, and he had given vent to divers
expressions, which Peregrine took amiss, our
young gentleman resolved to augment his punishment,
by teazing him with demands which could
not, he knew, be immediately satisfied; and
next day, sent Pipes to his father's house with the
note, which was drawn payable upon demand. 
The debtor, who had gone to bed half distracted
with his misfortune, finding himself waked with
such a disagreeable dun, lost all patience, cursed
Pickle, threatened his messenger, blasphemed
with horrible execrations, and made such a noise,
as reached the ears of his father, who ordering
his son to be called into his presence, examined
him about the cause of that uproar, which had
disturbed the whole family. The young gentleman,
after having essayed to amuse him with
sundry equivocations, which served only to increase
his suspicion, and desire of knowing the
truth, acknowledged that he had lost some money
overnight at cards, to a gamester, who had
been so impertinent as to send a message, demanding
it that morning, though he had told the
fellow, it would not suit him to pay it immediately. 
The father, who was a man of honour,
reproached him with great severity for his profligate
behaviour in general, and this scandalous 

debt in particular, which he believed to be some
trifle, and giving him a bank note for five hundred
pounds, commanded him to go and discharge
it, without loss of time. This well-principled
heir took the money, but instead of waiting
upon his creditor, he forthwith repaired to the
gaming-house, in hopes of retrieving his loss; 
and before he rose from the table, saw his note
mortgaged for seven eighths of its value. 
Mean while, Pickle, incensed at the treatment
which his servant had received, and informed of
his lordship's second loss, which aggravated his
resentment, determined to preserve no medium; 
and taking out a writ that same day, put it immediately
in execution upon the body of his
debtor, just as he stepp'd into his chair, at the
door of White's Chocolate-house. The prisoner
being naturally fierce and haughty, attempted
to draw upon the bailiffs, who disarmed
him in a twinkling; and this effort served only
to heighten his disgrace, which was witnessed by a
thousand people, most of whom laughed very heartily,
at the adventure of a lord's being arrested. 
Such a public transaction could not long escape
the knowledge of his father, who (that very day)
had the satisfaction to hear that his son was in a
spunging-house. In consequence of this information,
he sent his steward to learn the particulars of
the arrest, and was equally offended, surprized,
and concerned, when he understood the nature
of the debt, which he imagined his son had already
discharged. Unwilling to pay such a considerable
sum for a spendthrift, whom he had but
too much indulged, and who in less than one
week might involve himself in such another difficulty,
the old gentleman wrote a letter to Peregrine, 

representing what a hardship it would be
upon him to forfeit such sums by the indiscretion
of a son, whose engagements he was not bound
to fulfil, and desiring some mitigation in his demand,
as it was not a debt contracted for value
received, but incurred without subjecting him
to the least damage or inconvenience. 
Our adventurer no sooner received this letter,
than he went in person to wait upon the author,
to whom he, in a candid manner, related the
particular circumstances of the match, together
with the ingratitude and audacity of his son, which
he owned had stimulated him to such measures as
he, otherwise, would have scorned to take. The
nobleman acknowledged, that the revenge was
hardly adequate to the provocation, and condemned
the conduct of his son with such justice
and integrity, as disarmed Peregrine of his resentment,
and disposed him to give an undoubted
proof of his own disinterestedness, which he immediately
exhibited, by producing the note, and
tearing it to pieces, after having assured his lordship,
that the writ should be withdrawn, and the
prisoner discharged before night. 
The earl, who perfectly well understood the
value of money, and was no stranger to the characters
of mankind, stood amazed at this sacrifice
which Pickle protested was offered by his esteem
for his lordship; and after having complimented
him upon his generosity, in a very uncommon
strain of encomium, begg'd the favour of his acquaintance,
and insisted upon his dining with him
next day. The youth, proud of having met
with such an opportunity to distinguish himself,
in less than an hour performed every article of his
promise; and in the morning was visited by the 

debtor, who came, by the express order of his
father, to thank him for the obligation under
which he was laid, and ask pardon for the offence
he had given. 
This condescension was very glorious for our
hero, who graciously received his submission,
and accompanied him to dinner, where he was
caressed by the old earl with marks of particular
affection and esteem. Nor was his gratitude confined
to exterior civility; he offered him the use
of his interest at court, which was very powerful,
and repeated his desire of serving him so
pressingly, that Peregrine thought he could not
dispense with the opportunity of assisting his absent
friend Godfrey, in whose behalf he begg'd
the influence of his lordship. 
The earl, pleased with this request, which
was another proof of the young gentleman's benevolence,
said, he would not fail to pay the utmost
regard to his recommendation; and in six
weeks a captain's commission was actually signed
for the brother of Emilia, who was very agreeably
surprized at the intimation he received from the
war-office, though he was utterly ignorant of the
canal through which he obtained that promotion.
