An unexpected rencounter, and an happy revolution
in the affairs of our Adventurer. 
As she did not lodge within the precincts of
this garrison, she was one day, after tea,
conducted to the gate by the captain and the
count, and just as they approached the turnkey's
lodge, our hero's eyes were struck with
the apparition of his old companion Renaldo,
son of his benefactor and patron the count de
Melvile. What were the emotions of his soul,
when he saw that young gentleman enter the
prison, and advance towards him, after having
spoke to the goaler! He never doubted, that
being informed of his confinement, he was come
to upbraid him with his villainy and ingratitude,
and he in vain endeavoured to recollect
himself from that terror and guilty confusion
which his appearance had inspired; when the
stranger lifting up his eyes, started back with
signs of extreme amazement,and after a considerable
pause, exclaimed “Heaven and earth! 
Sure my eyes do not deceive me! is not your
name Fathom? it is, it must be my old friend
and companion, the loss of whom I have so
long regreted!” With these words, he ran towards
our adventurer, and while he clasped him
in his arms, with all the eagerness of affection,
protested that this was one of the happiest days
he had ever seen. 
Ferdinand, who from this salutation, concluded
himself still in possession of Renaldo's
good opinion, was not deficient in expressions 

of tenderness and joy; he returned his embraces
with equal ardour, the tears trickled down
his cheeks, and that perturbation which proceeded
from conscious perfidy and fear, was
mistaken by the unsuspecting Hungarian for
the sheer effects of love, gratitude and surprize. 
These first transports having subsided,
they adjourned to the lodgings of Fathom,
who soon recollected his spirits and invention
so well, as to amuse the other with a feigned
tale of his having been taken by the French,
sent prisoner into Champaign, from whence
he had written many letters to Count Melville
and his son, of whom he could hear no tidings; 
of his having contracted an intimacy with
a young nobleman in France, who died in the
flower of his age, after having, in token of
friendship, bequeathed to him a considerable legacy; 
by this he had been enabled to visit the
land of his forefathers in the character of a
gentleman, which he had supported with some
figure, until he was betrayed into a misfortune
that exhausted his funds, and drove him to
the spot where he was now found: and he solemnly
declared, that far from forgetting the
obligation he owed to count Melville, or renouncing
the friendship of Renaldo, he had
actually resolved to set out for Germany on his
return to the house of his patron in the beginning
of the week, posterior to that in which
he had been arrested. 
Young Melville, whose own heart had never
known the instigations of fraud, implicitely
believed the story and protestations of Fathom; 
and though he would not justify that
part of his conduct by which the term of his 

good fortune was abridged, he could not help
excusing an indiscretion into which he had been
hurried by the precipitancy of youth, and the
allurements of an artful woman: nay, with
the utmost warmth of friendship, he undertook
to wait upon Trapwell, and endeavoured
to soften him into some reasonable terms of
composition. 
Fathom seemed to be quite overwhelmed
with a deep sense of all this goodness, and affected
the most eager impatience to know the particulars
of Renaldo's fate, since their unhappy
separation; more especially his errand to this
uncomfortable place, which he should henceforth
revere as the providential scene of their
reunion; nor did he forget to enquire, in the
most affectionate and dutiful manner, about
the situation of his noble parents and amiable
sister. 
At mention of these names, Renaldo, fetching
a deep sigh, “Alas! my friend, (said he)
the Count is no more; and what aggravates
my affliction for the loss of such a father, it
was my misfortune to be under his displeasure
at the time of his death. Had I been present
on that melancholy occasion, so well I knew
his generosity and paternal tenderness, that
sure I am, he would in his last moments have
forgiven an only son whose life had been a continual
effort to render himself worthy of such
a parent, and whose crime was no other than
an honourable passion for the most meritorious
of her sex. But I was removed at a fatal
distance from him, and doubtless my conduct
must have been invidiously misrepresented. Be
that as it will, my mother has again given her 

hand in wedlock to Count Trevasi; by whom
I have the mortification to be informed that I
am totally excluded from my father's succession; 
and I learn from other quarters, that
my sister is barbarously treated by this inhuman
father-in law. Grant, Heaven, I may
soon have an opportunity of expostulating
with the tyrant upon that subject.” 
So saying, his cheeks glowed, and his eyes
lightened with resentment. Then he thus proceeded: 
“My coming hither to-day, was with a
view to visit a poor female relation, from
whom I yesterday received a letter describing
her most deplorable situation, and soliciting my
assistance: but the turnkey affirms, that there
is no such person in the jail; and I was on my
way to consult the keeper, when I was agreeably
surprised with the sight of my dear Fathom.” 
Our adventurer having wiped from his
eyes the tears which were produced by the
news of his worthy patron's death, desired to
know the name of that afflicted prisoner in
whose behalf he interested himself so much,
and Renaldo produced the letter, subscribed
your unfortunate cousin Helen Melvil. This
pretended relation, after having explained the
degree of consanguinity which she and the
Count stood in to each other, and occasionally
mentioned some anecdotes of the family in
Scotland, gave him to understand, that she
had married a merchant of London, who, by
repeated losses in trade, had been reduced to
indigence, and afterwards confined in prison,
where he then lay a breathless course, having 

left her in the utmost extremity of wretchedness
and want, with two young children in the
small pox, and an incurable cancer in one of
her own breasts. Indeed, the picture she
drew was so moving, and her expressions so
sensibly pathetic, that no person whose heart
was not altogether callous, could peruse it
without emotion. Renaldo had sent two guineas
by the messenger whom she had represented
as a trusty servant, whose fidelity had been
proof against all the distress of her mistress:
and he was now arrived, in order to reinforce
his bounty. 
Fathom, in the consciousness of his own practices,
immediately comprehended the scheme of
this letter, and confidently assured him, that no
such person resided in the prison, or in any other
place, and when his friend applied for information
to the keeper, these assurances were
confirmed; and that stern janitor told him, he
had been imposed upon by a stale trick which
was often practised upon strangers, by a set of
sharpers, who make it their business to pick
up hints of intelligence relating to private
families, upon which they build such superstructures
of fraud and imposition. 
However piqued the young Hungarian might
be to find himself duped in this manner, he
rejoyced at the occasion which had thrown Fathom
in his way; and, after having made him a
tender of his purse, took his leave, on purpose
to wait upon Trapwell, who was not quite so
untractable as an enraged cuckold commonly is; 
for, by this time,he had accomplished the
best part of his aim, which was to be devorced
from his wife, and was fully convinced that the 

defendant was no more than a needy adventurer,
who in all probability would be released
by an act of parliament for the benefit of insolvent
debtors; in which case, he (the plaintiff)
would reap no solid advantage from his imprisonment. 
He therefore listened to the remonstrances of
the mediator, and after much canvassing agreed
to discharge the defendant in consideration of
two hundred pounds, which were immediately
paid by Count Melvil, who by this deduction
was reduced to somewhat less than thirty. 
Nevertheless he chearfully beggared himself in
behalf of his friend, for whose release he forthwith
obtained an order; and next day our adventurer,
having bid a formal adieu to his fellows
in distress, and in particular to his majesty, for
whose restoration his prayers were preferred,
he quitted the jail, and accompanied his deliverer,
with all the outward marks of unutterable
gratitude and esteem, 
Surley, if his heart had been made of penetrable
stuff, it would have been touuched by the circumstances
of this redemption; but, had
not his soul been invincible to all such attacks,
these memoires would, possibly, never have seen
the light. 
When they arrived at Renaldo's lodgings,
that young gentleman honoured him with
other proofs of confidence and friendship, by
giving him a circumstantial detail of all the adventures
in which he had been engaged after
Fathom's desertion from the imperial camp. 
He told him, that immediately after the war
was finished, his father had pressed him to a
very advantageous match, with which he 

would have complied, though his heart was
not at all concerned, had not he been inflamed
with the desire of seeing the world before he
could take any step towards a settlement for
life: that he had signified his sentiments on
this head to the Count, who opposed them
with unusual obstinacy, as productive of a delay
which might be fatal to his proposal: for
which reason he had retired incognito from his
family, and travelled through sundry states
and countries in a disguise, by which he eluded
the inquiries of his parents. 
That in the course of these peregrinations
he was captivated by the irresistible charms of
a young lady, on whose heart he had the good
fortune to make a tender impression; that
their mutual love had subjected both to many
dangers and difficulties, during which they suffered
a cruel separation; after the torments of
which, he had happily found her in England,
where she now lived entirely cut off from her
native country and connections, and destitute
of every other resource, but his honour, love,
and protection: and, finally, that he was determined
to combat his own desires, how violent
soever they might be, until he should have
made some suitable provision for the consequences
of a stricter union with the mistress
of his soul, that he might not, by a precipitate
marriage, ruin the person whom he adored. 
This end he proposed to attain, by an application
to the court of Vienna, which, he did
not doubt, would have some regard to his own
service and that of his father; and thither he
resolved to repair with the first opportunity,
now that he had found a friend with whom 

he could intrust the inestimable jewel of his
heart. 
He likewise gave our hero to understand,
that he had been eight months in England,
during which he had lived in a frugal manner,
that he might not unnecessarily exhaust the
money he had been able to raise upon his own
credit; that hitherto he had been obliged to
defer his departure for Germany, on account
of his attendance upon the mother of his mistress,
who was lately dead of sorrow and chagrin; 
and that since he resided in London, he
had often heard of the celebrated Count Fathom,
though he never imagined that his
friend Ferdinand could be distinguished by
that appellation.
