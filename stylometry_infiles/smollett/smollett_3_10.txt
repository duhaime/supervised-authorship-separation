He is found by the lieutenant; reconducted to his
own house; married to Mrs. Grizzle, who meets
with a small misfortune in the night, and asserts
her prerogative next morning; in consequence of
which her husband's eye is endangered. 
Mean while lieutenant Hatchway made
shift to hobble to the church, where he
informed the company of what had happened to
the commodore; and the bride behaved with
great decency on the occasion; for, as soon as
she understood the danger to which her future
husband was exposed, she fainted in the arms of
her sister-in-law, to the surprize of all the spectators,
who could not comprehend the cause of
her disorder; and when she was recovered by
the application of smelling-bottles, earnestly
begged that Mr. Hatchway and Tom Pipes would
take her brother's coach, and go in quest of
their commander. 
This task they readily undertook, being escorted
by all the rest of his adherents on horseback; 
while the bride and her friends were invited to
the parson's house, and the ceremony deferred
till another occasion. 
The lieutenant, steering his course as near the
line of direction in which Trunnion went off as
the coach-road would permit, got intelligence of 

his track from one farm-house to another; for
such an apparition could not fail of attracting particular
notice; and one of the horsemen having
picked up his hat and wig in a bye-path, the whole
troop entered the village where he was lodged,
about four o'clock in the afternoon. When they
understood he was safely housed at the George,
they rode up to the door in a body, and expressed
their satisfaction in three chears; which were returned
by the company within, as soon as they
were instructed in the nature of the salute by
Trunnion, who by this time had entered into
all the jollity of his new friends, and was indeed
more than half-seas over. The lieutenant was
introduced to all present as his sworn brother,
and had something tossed up for his dinner. Tom
Pipes and the crew were regaled in another room; 
and a fresh pair of horses being put to the coach,
about six in the evening the commodore, with
all his attendants, departed for the garrison, after
having shook hands with every individual in the
house. 
Without any farther accident he was conveyed
in safety to his own gate before nine, and
committed to the care of Pipes, who carried him
instantly to his hammock, while the lieutenant
was driven away to the place where the bride and
her friends remained in great anxiety, which vanished
when he assured them that his commodore
was safe, being succeeded by abundance of mirth
and pleasantry at the account he gave of Trunnion's
adventure. 
Another day was fixed for the nuptials; and,
in order to baulk the curiosity of idle people,
which had given great offence, the parson was
prevailed upon to perform the ceremony in the 

garrison, which all that day was adorned with
flags and pendants displayed, and at night illuminated
by the direction of Hatchway, who also
ordered the patereroes to be fired as soon as the
marriage knot was tied. Neither were the other
parts of the entertainment neglected by this ingenious
contriver, who produced undeniable proofs
of his elegance and art in the wedding-supper,
which had been committed to his management
and direction. This general banquet was intirely
composed of sea-dishes; a huge pillaw,
consisting of a large piece of beef sliced, a couple
of fowls, and half a peck of rice, smoaked in
the middle of the board: a dish of hard fish
swimming in oil appeared at each end, the sides
being furnished with a mess of that savoury composition
known by the name of lob's course, and
a plate of salmagundy. The second course displayed
a goose of a monstrous magnitude, flanked
with two Guinea hens, a pig barbecu'd, an hock
of salt pork in the midst of a pease-pudding, a
leg of mutton roasted, with potatoes, and another
boiled, with yams. The third service was made
up of a loin of fresh pork with apple-sauce, a kid
smothered with onions, and a terrapin baked in
the shell: and last of all, a prodigious sea-pye
was presented, with an infinite volume of pancakes
and fritters. That every thing might be
answerable to the magnificence of this delicate
feast, he had provided vast quantities of strong
beer, flip, rumbo, and burnt brandy, with plenty
of Barbadoes water for the ladies; and hired all
the fiddles within six miles, who, with the addition
of a drum, bag-pipe, and Welch-harp, regaled
the guests with a most melodious concert. 

The company, who were not at all exceptious,
seemed extremely well pleased with every particular
of the entertainment; and the evening being
spent in the most social manner, the bride
was by her sister conducted to her apartment,
where, however, a trifling circumstance had like
to have destroyed the harmony which had been
hitherto maintained. 
I have already observed, that there was not
one standing bed within the walls; therefore the
reader will not wonder that Mrs. Trunnion
was out of humour, when she found herself under
the necessity of being confined with her spouse
in a hammock, which tho' enlarged with a double
portion of canvas, and dilated with a yoke
for the occasion, was at best but a disagreeable,
not to say dangerous situation. She accordingly
complained with some warmth of this inconvenience,
which she imputed to disrespect, and at
first absolutely refused to put up with the expedient:
but Mrs. Pickle soon brought her to reason
and compliance, by observing that one night
would soon be elapsed, and next day she might
regulate her own oeconomy. 
Thus persuaded, she ventured into the vehicle,
and was visited by her husband in less than an
hour, the company being departed to their own
homes, and the garrison left to the command of
his lieutenant and mate. But it seems the hooks
that supported this swinging couch were not calculated
for the addition of weight which they were
now destined to bear; and therefore gave way in
the middle of the night, to the no small terror of
Mrs. Trunnion, who perceiving herself falling,
screamed aloud, and by that exclamation brought
Hatchway with a light into the chamber. Tho' 

she had received no injury by the fall she was
extremely discomposed and incensed at the accident,
which she even openly ascribed to the obstinacy
and whimsical oddity of the commodore,
in such petulant terms as evidently declared that
she thought her great aim accomplished, and her
authority secured against all the shocks of fortune. 
Indeed her bedfellow seemed to be of the same
opinion, by his tacit resignation; for he made no
reply to her insinuations, but with a most vinegar
aspect crawled out of his nest, and betook himself
to rest in another apartment, while his irritated
spouse dismissed the lieutenant, and from
the wreck of the hammock made an occasional
bed for herself on the floor, fully determined to
provide better accommodation for next night's
lodging. 
Having no inclination to sleep, her thoughts
during the remaining part of the night were engrossed
by a scheme of reformation she was resolved
to execute in the family; and no sooner
did the first lark bid salutation to the morn, than
starting from her humble couch, and huddling on
her cloaths, she sallied from her chamber, explored
her way thro' paths before unknown, and
in the course of her researches perceived a large
bell, to which she made such effectual application
as alarmed every soul in the family. In a moment
she was surrounded by Hatchway, Pipes,
and all the rest of the servants half dressed; but
seeing none of the feminine gender appear, she
began to storm at the sloth and laziness of the
maids, who, she observed, ought to have been
at work an hour at least before she called; 
and then, for the first time, understood that no
woman was permitted to sleep within the walls. 

She did not fail to exclaim against this regulation; 
and being informed that the cook and
chambermaid lodged in a small office-house that
stood without the gate, ordered the draw-bridge
to be let down, and in person beat up their
quarters, commanding them forthwith to set
about scouring the rooms, which had not been
hitherto kept in a very decent condition, while
two men were immediately employed to transport
the bed on which she used to lie from her brother's
house to her new habitation; so that, in
less than two hours, the whole oeconomy of the
garrison was turned topsy-turvy, and every thing
involved in such tumult and noise, that Trunnion
being disturbed and distracted with the uproar,
turned out in his shirt like a frantic maniac, and
arming himself with a cudgel of crab-tree, made
an irruption into his wife's apartment, where
perceiving a couple of carpenters at work, in
joining a bedstead, he, with many dreadful oaths
and opprobrious invectives, ordered them to desist,
swearing he would suffer no bulk-heads nor
hurricane-houses to stand where he was master:
but finding his remonstrances disregarded by these
mechanics, who believed him to be some madman
belonging to the family, who had broke
from his confinement, he assaulted them both
with great fury and indignation, and was handled
so roughly in the encounter, that in a very short
time he measured his length on the floor, in consequence
of a blow that he received from a hammer,
by which the sight of his remaining eye
was grievously endangered. 
Having thus reduced him to a state of subjection,
they resolved to secure him with cords,
and were actually busy in adjusting his fetters, 

when he was exempted from the disgrace by
the accidental entrance of his spouse, who rescued
him from the hands of his adversaries, and, in
the midst of her condolance, imputed his misfortune
to the inconsiderate roughness of his own
disposition. 
He breathed nothing but revenge, and made
some efforts to chastise the insolence of the workmen,
who, as soon as they understood his quality,
asked forgiveness for what they had done
with great humility, protesting that they did not
know he was master of the house. But, far
from being satisfied with this apology, he groped
about for the bell, (the inflammation on his eye
having utterly deprived him of sight) and the
rope being, by the precaution of the delinquents,
conveyed out of his reach, began to storm with
incredible vociferation, like a lion roaring in the
toil, pouring forth innumerable oaths and execrations,
and calling by name Hatchway and
Pipes, who being within hearing, obeyed the extraordinary
summons, and were ordered to put
the carpenters in irons, for having audaciously
assaulted him in his own house. 
His myrmidons seeing he had been evil-intreated,
were exasperated at the insult he had suffered,
which they considered as an affront upon the dignity
of the garrison; the more so, as the mutineers
seemed to put themselves in a posture of
defence, and set their authority at defiance: they
therefore unsheathed their cutlasses, which they
commonly wore as badges of their commission; 
and a desperate engagement, in all probability,
would have ensued, had not the lady of the castle
interposed, and prevented the effects of their
animosity, by assuring the lieutenant that the 

commodore had been the aggressor; and that the
workmen, finding themselves attacked in such an
extraordinary manner, by a person whom they
did not know, were obliged to act in their own
defence, by which he had received that unlucky
contusion. 
Mr. Hatchway no sooner learnt the sentiments
of Mrs. Trunnion, than sheathing his indignation,
he told the commodore he should always
be ready to execute his lawful commands; but
that he could not in conscience be concerned in
oppressing poor people who had been guilty of no
offence. 
This unexpected declaration, together with the
behaviour of his wife, who in his hearing desired
the carpenters to resume their work, filled
the breast of Trunnion with rage and mortification. 
He pulled off his woollen night-cap, pummelled
his bare pate, beat the floor alternately
with his feet, swore his people had betrayed him,
and cursed himself to the lowest pit of hell, for
having admitted such a cockatrice into his family. 
But all these exclamations did not avail; they
were among the last essays of his resistance to
the will of his wife, whose influence among his
adherents had already swallowed up his own; 
and who now peremptorily told him, that he
must leave the management of every thing within
doors to her, who understood best what was for
his honour and advantage. She then ordered a
poultice to be prepared for his eye, which being
applied, he was committed to the care of Pipes,
by whom he was led about the house like a blind
bear growling for prey, while his industrious
yoke-fellow executed every circumstance of the
plan she had projected; so that, when he recovered 

his vision, he was an utter stranger in his
own house.
