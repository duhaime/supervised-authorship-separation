Our land forces being disembarked, erect a
faschine battery—our ship is ordered with
four more, to batter the fort of Bocca Chica
—Mackshane's cowardice—the chaplain's
phrenzy—honest Rattlin loses one
hand—his heroism and reflections on the
battle—Crampley's behaviour to me during
the heat of the fight. 
Our forces being landed and stationed as I
have already mentioned, set about erecting
a faschine battery to cannonade the principal fort
of the enemy, and in something more than three
weeks, it was ready to open. That we might do
the Spaniards as much honour as possible, it was
determined in a council of war, that five of our
largest ships should attack the fort on one side,
while the battery played it on the other, strengthened
with two mortars, and twenty-four co-horns. 
Accordingly, the signal for our ship to engage,
among others, was hoisted, we being advertised
the night before, to make every thing clear for
that purpose: and in so doing, a difference happened
between captain Oakhum and his well-beloved
cousin and counsellor Mackshane, which
had well nigh terminated in an open rupture. — 
The doctor, who had imagined there was no more
danger of being hurt by the enemy's shot in the 

cockpit than in the center of the earth, was lately
informed that a surgeon's mate had been killed in
that place, by a cannon-ball from two small forts,
that were destroyed before the disembarkation of
our soldiers; and therefore insisted upon having
a platform raised for the convenience of the sick
and wounded, in the after-hold, where he deemed
himself more secure than on the deck above. —The
captain, offended at this extraordinary proposal,
accused him of pusilanimity, and told him there
was no room in the hold for such an occasion; 
or if there was, he could not expect to be indulged
more than the rest of the surgeons of the
navy, who used the cockpit for that purpose: 
Fear rendering Mackshane obstinate, he persisted
in his demand, and shewed his instructions, by
which it was authorised: The captain swore these
instructions were dictated by a parcel of lazy
poltroons who were never at sea; but was obliged
to comply, and sent for the carpenter to give him
orders about it: But before any such measure
could be taken, our signal was thrown out, and
the doctor compelled to trust his carcase in the
cockpit, where Morgan and I were busy in putting
our instruments and dressings in order. 
Our ship, with the others destined for this service,
immediately weighed, and in less than half
an hour came to an anchor before the castle of
Bocca Chica, with a spring upon our cable. — 
The cannonading (which indeed was terrible!)
began. The surgeon, after having crossed himself,
fell flat on the deck; and the chaplain and purser,
who were stationed with us, in quality of assistants,
followed his example, while the Welchman
and I sat upon a chest looking at one another
with great discomposure, scarce able to refrain 

from the like prostration. —And that the reader
may know, it was not a common occasion that
alarmed us thus, I must inform him of the particulars
of this dreadful din that astonished us. The fire of
the Spaniards proceeded from Bocca Chica mounting
eighty-four great guns, beside a mortar and
small arms; from fort St. Joseph, mounting
thirty-six; from two faschine batteries, mounting
twenty; and from four men of war, mounting
sixty-four guns each. —This was answered by us,
from our land battery, mounting twenty-one
cannon; our bomb battery, mounting two mortars,
and twenty-four cohorns, and five men of
war, two of eighty, and three of seventy guns,
which fired without intermission. —We had not
been many minutes engaged, when one of the
sailors brought another on his back to the cockpit,
where he tossed him down like a bag of oats,
and pulling out his pouch, put a large chew of
tobacco in his mouth, without speaking a word; 
Morgan immediately examined the condition of
the wounded man, and cried, “As I shall answer
now, the man is as tead as my great-grandfather.” 
—“Dead (said his comrade) he
may be dead now, for ought I know, but I'll
be d&sblank;mn'd if he was not alive when I took
him up.” —So saying, he was about to return to
his quarters, when I bid him carry the body along
with him and throw it over-board. — 
“D&wblank;n the body! (said he) I think 'tis fair
enough if I take care of my own.” —My
fellow-mate snatching up the amputation knife,
pursued him half-way up the cockpit ladder, crying,
“You lousy rascal, is this the church-yard,
or the charnel-house, or the sepulchre, or the
Golgotha of the ship?”—but was stopt in his 

carreer by one calling, “Yo ho, avast there— 
scaldings.” —“Scaldings! (answered Morgan)
Got knows 'tis hot enough indeed:—who are
you?” —“Here's one (replied the voice.”)
and I immediately knew it to be that of my
honest friend Jack Rattlin, who coming towards
me, told me, with great deliberation, he was come
to be dock'd at last, and discovered the remains
of one hand which had been shattered to pieces
with grape shot. —I lamented with unfeigned sorrow
his misfortune, which he bore with heroic
courage, observing, that every shot had its
commission: It was well it did not take
him in the head; or if it had, what then? he
should have died bravely, fighting for his king
and country: Death was a debt which every
man owed, and must pay now as well as another
time. —I was much pleased and edified with
the maxims of this sea-philosopher, who endured
the amputation of his left hand without shrinking; 
the operation being performed (at his request)
by me, after Mackshane, who was with
difficulty prevailed to lift his head from the deck,
had declared there was a necessity for his losing
the limb. —While I was employed in dressing the
stump, I asked Jack's opinion of the battle, who
shaking his head, frankly told me, he believed we
should do no good: “For why, because instead
of dropping anchor close under shore, where
we should have had to deal with one corner of
Bocca Chica only, we had opened the harbour,
and exposed ourselves to the whole fire of the
enemy from their shipping and fort St. Joseph,
as well as from the castle we intended to canonade; 
that besides, we lay at too great a
distance to damage the walls, and three parts
in four of our shot did not take place; for 

there was scarce any body on board, who understood
the pointing of a gun. —Ah! God
help us! (continued he) if your kinsman lieutenant
Bowling had been here, we should have
had other-guess-work.” —By this time our patients
had increased to such a degree, that we did
not know which to begin with; and the first
mate plainly told the surgeon, that if he did not
get up immediately, and perform his duty, he
would complain of his behaviour to the admiral,
and make application for his warrant. —This effectually
roused Mackshane, who was never deaf
to an argument in which he thought his interest was
concerned; he therefore rose up, and in order to
strengthen his resolution, had recourse more than
once to a case-bottle of rum which he freely
communicated to the chaplain and purser, who
had as much need of such extraordinary inspiration
as himself: Being thus supported, he went
to work, and arms and legs were hewed down
without mercy. —The fumes of the liquor mounting
into the parson's brain, conspired with his
former agitation of spirits, to make him quite delirious; 
he stript himself to the skin, and besmearing
his body with blood, could scarce be
with-held from running upon deck in that condition. 
Jack Rattlin, scandalized at this deportment,
endeavoured to allay his transports with reason; 
but finding all he said ineffectual, and great
confusion occasioned by his frolicks, he knocked
him down with his right hand, and by threats
kept him quiet in that state of humiliation. — 
But it was not in the power of rum to elevate the
purser, who sat on the floor wringing his hands,
and cursing the hour in which he left his peaceable
profession of a brewer in Rochester, to engage in 

such a life of terror and disquiet. —While we diverted
ourselves at the expence of this poor devil,
a shot happened to take us between wind and
water, and its course being through the purser's
store-room, made a terrible havock and noise among
the jars and bottles in its way, and disconcerted
Mackshane so much, that he dropt his
scalpel, and falling down on his knees, pronounced
his Pater-noster aloud; the purser fell backward
and lay without sense or motion; and the chaplain
grew, so outrageous, that Rattlin with one hand,
could not keep him under; so that we were obliged
to confine him in the surgeon's cabbin,
where he was no doubt guilty of a thousand extravagancies. 
—Much about this time, my old antagonist
Crampley came down, with express orders
(as he said) to bring me up to the quarter-deck,
to dress a slight wound the captain had received
by a splinter. His reason for honouring
me in particular with this piece of service, being
that in case I should be killed or disabled by the
way, my death or mutilation would be of less
consequence to the ship's company, than that of
the doctor or his first mate. —At another time,
perhaps, I might have disputed this order, to
which I was not bound to pay the least regard; 
but as I thought my reputation depended upon
my compliance, I was resolved to convince my
rival that I was no more afraid than he, to expose
myself to danger. —With this view, I provided
myself with dressings, and followed him
immediately to the quarter-deck, through a most
infernal scene of slaughter, fire, smoak, and uproar! 
Captain Oakhum, who leaned against the
mizen mast, no sooner saw me approach in my
shirt, with the sleeves tucked up to my arm-pits, 

and my hands dyed with blood, than he signified his
displeasure by a frown, and asked why the doctor
himself did not come? I told him Crampley had
singled me out, as if by his express command; 
at which he seemed surprized, and threatened
to punish the midshipman for his presumption,
after the engagement: In the mean time, I
was sent back to my station, and ordered
to tell Mackshane, that the captain expected him
immediately. —I got safe back and delivered up
my commission to the doctor, who flatly refused
to quit the post affigned to him by his instructions. 
Hereupon, Morgan, who (I believe) was jealous
of my reputation for courage, undertook the
affair, and ascended with great intrepidity. — 
The captain finding the surgeon obstinate, suffered
himself to be dressed, and swore he would
confine Mackshane as soon as that service should
be over.
