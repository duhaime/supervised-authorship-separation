DEAR WAT,
IN my two last you had so much of Lismahago,
that I suppose you are glad he is gone off the
stage for the present. —I must now descend to domestic
occurrences. —Love, it seems, is resolved
to assert his dominion over all the females of our
family. —After having practised upon poor Liddy's
heart, and played strange vagaries with our aunt
Mrs. Tabitha, he began to run riot in the affections
of her woman Mrs. Winifred Jenkins, whom 

I have had occasion to mention more than once in
the course of our memoirs. Nature intended Jenkins
for something very different from the character
of her mistress; yet custom and habit have effected
a wonderful resemblance betwixt them in
many particulars. Win, to be sure, is much younger
and more agreeable in her person; she is likewise
tender-hearted and benevolent, qualities for
which her mistress is by no means remarkable, no
more than she is for being of a timorous disposition,
and much subject to fits of the mother, which are
the infirmities of Win's constitution: but then she
seems to have adopted Mrs. Tabby's manner with
her cast cloaths. —She dresses and endeavours to
look like her mistress, although her own looks are
much more engaging. —She enters into her scheme
of oeconomy, learns her phrases, repeats her remarks,
imitates her stile in scolding the inferior servants,
and, finally, subscribes implicitly to her system
of devotion —This, indeed, she found the
more agreeable, as it was in a great measure introduced
and confirmed by the ministry of Clinker,
with whose personal merit she seems to have been
struck ever since he exhibited the pattern of his
naked skin at Marlborough. 
Nevertheless, though Humphry had this double
hank upon her inclinations, and exerted all his
power to maintain the conquest he had made, he
found it impossible to guard it on the side of vanity,
where poor Win was as frail as any female in the
kingdom. In short, my rascal Dutton professed
himself her admirer, and, by dint of his outlandish
qualifications, threw his rival Clinker out of the
saddle of her heart. Humphry may be compared
to an English pudding, composed of good wholesome
flour and suet, and Dutton to a syllabub or
iced froth, which, though agreeable to the taste,
has nothing solid or substantial. The traitor not 

only dazzled her with his second-hand finery, but
he fawned, and flattered, and cringed—he taught
her to take rappee, and presented her with a snuff-box
of papier mache—he supplied her with a powder
for her teeth—he mended her complexion,
and he dressed her hair in the Paris fashion—he
undertook to be her French master and her dancing-master,
as well as friseur, and thus imperceptibly
wound himself into her good graces. Clinker
perceived the progress he had made, and repined in
secret. —He attempted to open her eyes in the way
of exhortation, and, finding it produced no effect,
had recourse to prayer. At Newcastle, while he
attended Mrs. Tabby to the methodist meeting, his
rival accompanied Mrs. Jenkins to the play. He
was dressed in a silk coat, made at Paris for his
former master, with a tawdry waistcoat of tarnished
brocard; he wore his hair in a great bag with a
huge solitaire, and a long sword dangled from his
thigh. The lady was all of a flutter with faded
lutestring, washed gauze, and ribands three times
refreshed; but she was most remarkable for the
frisure of her head, which rose, like a pyramid,
seven inches above the scalp, and her face was
primed and patched from the chin up to the eyes; 
nay, the gallant himself had spared neither red nor
white in improving the nature of his own complexion. 
In this attire, they walked together
through the high street to the theatre, and as they
passed for players ready dressed for acting, they
reached it unmolested; but as it was still light
when they returned, and by that time the people
had got information of their real character and condition,
they hissed and hooted all the way, and
Mrs. Jenkins was all bespattered with dirt, as well
as insulted with the opprobious name of painted
Jezabel, so that her fright and mortification threw
her into an hysteric fit the moment she came home. 

Clinker was so incensed at Dutton, whom he
considered as the cause of her disgrace, that he upbraided
him severely for having turned the poor
young woman's brain. The other affected to treat
him with contempt, and mistaking his forbearance
for want of courage, threatened to horse-whip him
into good manners. Humphry then came to me,
humbly begging I would give him leave to chastise
my servant for his insolence —“He has challenged
me to fight him at sword's point (said he); 
but I might as well challenge him to make a
horse-shoe, or a plough-iron; for I know no
more of the one than he does of the other. — 
Besides, it doth not become servants to use those
weapons, or to claim the privilege of gentlemen
to kill one another when they fall out; moreover,
I would not have his blood upon my conscience
for ten thousand times the profit or satisfaction
I should get by his death; but if your
honour won't be angry, I'll engage to gee 'en a
good drubbing, that, may hap, will do 'en service,
and I'll take care it shall do 'en no harm.” 
I said, I had no objection to what he proposed,
provided he could manage matters so as not to be
found the aggressor, in case Dutton should prosecute
him for an assault and battery. 
Thus licensed, he retired; and that same evening
easily provoked his rival to strike the first blow,
which Clinker returned with such interest, that he
was obliged to call for quarter, declaring, at the
same time, that he would exact severe and bloody
satisfaction the moment we should pass the border,
when he could run him through the body without
fear of the consequence. —This scene passed in
presence of lieutenant Lismahago, who encouraged
Clinker to hazard a thrust of cold iron with his antagonist. 
“Cold iron (cried Humphry) I shall
never use against the life of any human creature; 

but I am so far from being afraid of his
cold iron, that I shall use nothing in my defence
but a good cudgel, which shall always be at his
service.” In the mean time, the fair cause of
this contest; Mrs. Winifred Jenkins, seemed overwhelmed
with affliction, and Mr. Clinker acted
much on the reserve, though he did not presume
to find fault with her conduct. 
The dispute between the two rivals was soon
brought to a very unexpected issue. Among our
fellow-lodgers at Berwick, was a couple from London,
bound to Edinburgh, on the voyage of matrimony. 
The female was the daughter and heiress
of a pawn-broker deceased, who had given her
guardians the slip, and put herself under the tuition
of a tall Hibernian, who had conducted her thus
far in quest of a clergyman to unite them in marriage,
without the formalities required by the law
of England. I know not how the lover had behaved
on the road, so as to decline in favour of his
inamorata; but, in all probability, Dutton perceived
a coldness on her side, which encouraged
him to whisper, it was a pity she should have cast
her affections upon a taylor, which he affirmed the
Irishman to be. This discovery compleated her
disgust, of which my man taking the advantage,
began to recommend himself to her good graces,
and the smooth-tongued rascal found no difficulty
to insinuate himself into the place of her heart
from which the other had been discarded. —Their
resolution was immediately taken. In the morning,
before day, while poor Teague lay snoring a-bed,
his indefatigable rival ordered a post-chaise, and
set out with the lady for Coldstream, a few miles
up the Tweed, where there was a person who
dealt in this branch of commerce, and they
were noosed, before the Irishman ever dreamt of
the matter. But when he got up at six o'clock, 

and found the bird was flown, he made such a
noise as alarmed the whole house. One of the
first persons he encountered, was the postilion returned
from Coldstream, where he had been witness
to the marriage, and over and above an handsome
gratuity, had received a bride's favour, which
he now wore in his cap —When the forsaken lover
understood they were actually married. and
set out for London; and that Dutton had discovered
to the lady, that he (the Hibernian) was a taylor,
he had like to have run distracted. He tore the
riband from the fellow's cap, and beat about his
ears. He swore he would pursue him to the gates
of hell, and ordered a post-chaise and four to be
got ready as soon as possible; but, recollecting that
his finances would not admit of this way of travelling,
he was obliged to countermand this order. 
For my part, I knew nothing at all of what had
happened, till the postilion brought me the keys
of my trunk and portmanteau, which he had received
from Dutton, who sent me his respects,
hoping I would excuse him for his abrupt departure,
as it was a step upon which his fortune depended 
—Before I had time to make my uncle acquainted
with this event, the Irishman burst into
my chamber, without any introduction, exclaiming, 
—“But my soul, your sarvant has robbed me
of five thousand pounds, and I'll have satisfaction,
if I should be hanged to-morrow.—” 
When I asked him who he was, “My name (said
he) is Master Macloughlin—but it should be
Leighlin Oneale, for I am come from Ter-Owen
the Great; and so I am as good a gentleman
as any in Ireland; and that rouge, your
sarvant, said I was a taylor, which was as big
a lie as if he had called me the pope —I'm a
man of fortune, and have spent all I had; and
so being in distress, Mr. Coshgrave, the fashioner 

in Shuffolk-street, tuck me out, and made
me his own private secretary: by the same token,
I was the last he bailed; for his freinds
obliged him to tie himself up, that he would
bail no more above ten pounds; for why, because
as how, he could not refuse any body that
asked, and therefore in time would have robbed
himself of his whole fortune, and, if he had
lived long at that rate, must have died bankrupt
very soon—and so I made my addresses to Miss
Skinner, a young lady of five thousand pounds
fortune, who agreed to take me for better nor
worse; and, to be sure, this day would have
put me in possession, if it had not been for that
rogue, your sarvant, who came like a tief, and
stole away my property, and made her believe
I was a taylor; and that she was going to marry
the ninth part of a man: but the devil burn my
soul, if ever I catch him on the mountains of
Tulloghobegly, if I don't shew him that I'm
nine times as good a man as he, or e'er a bug
of his country.” 
When he had rung out his first alarm, I told him
I was sorry he had allowed himself to be so jockied; 
but it was no business of mine; and that the
fellow who robbed him of his bride, had likewise
robbed me of my servant —“Didn't I tell you then,
(cried he,) that rogue was his true Christian
name. —Oh! if I had but one fair trust with
him upon the sod, I'd give him lave to brag all
the rest of his life.” 
My uncle hearing the noise, came in, and being
informed of this adventure, began to comfort
Mr. Oneale for the lady's elopement; observing
that he seemed to have had a lucky escape, that
it was better she should elope before, than after
marriage —The Hibernian was of a very different
opinion. He said, “If he had been once married, 

she might have eloped as soon as she pleased; 
he would have taken care that she should not
have carried her fortune along with her —Ah
(said he) she's a Judas Iscariot, and has betrayed
me with a kiss; and, like Judas, she carried
the bag, and has not left me money enough to
bear my expences back to London; and so as
I'm come to this pass, and the rogue that was
the occasion of it has left you without a sarvant,
you may put me in his place; and by Jasus, it is
the best thing you can do.—” I begged to be
excused, declaring I could put up with any inconvenience,
rather than treat as a footman the descendant
of Tir owen the Great. I advised him
to return to his friend, Mr. Cosgrave, and take
his passage from Newcastle by sea, towards which
I made him a small present, and he retired, seemingly
resigned to his evil fortune. I have taken
upon trial a Scotchman, called Archy M'Alpin,
an old soldier, whose last master, a colonel, lately
died at Berwick. The fellow is old and withered; 
but he has been recommended to me for his fidelity,
by Mrs. Humphreys, a very good sort of a
woman who keeps the inn at Tweedmouth, and
is much respected by all the travellers on this road. 
Clinker, without doubt, thinks himself happy
in the removal of a dangerous rival, and he is too
good a christian, to repine at Dutton's success. Even
Mrs. Jenkins will have reason to congratulate herself
upon this event, when she coolly reflects upon
the matter; for, howsoever she was forced from
her poise for a season, by snares laid for her vanity,
Humphry is certainly the north-star to which the
needle of her affection would have pointed at the
long run. At present, the same vanity is exceedingly
mortified, upon finding herself abandoned by
her new admirer, in favour of another inamorata. 
She received the news with a violent burst of 

laughter which soon brought on a fit of crying; 
and this gave the finishing blow to the patience of
her mistress, which had held out beyond all expectation. 
She now opened all those flood-gates of reprehension,
which had been shut so long. She not
only reproached her with her levity and indiscretion,
but attacked her on the score of religion, declaring
roundly that she was in a state of apostacy and reprobation; 
and finally, threatened to send her a-packing
at this extremity of the kingdom. All the
family interceded for poor Winifrid, not even excepting
her slighted swain, Mr. Clinker, who, on
his knees, implored and obtained her pardon. 
There was, however, another consideration that
gave Mrs. Tabitha some disturbance. At Newcastle,
the servants had been informed by some wag,
that there was nothing to eat in Scotland, but oat
meal and sheep's heads; and Lieutenant Lismahago
being consulted, what he said served rather to confirm
than to refute the report. Our aunt being
apprised of this circumstance, very gravely advised
her brother to provide a sumpter horse with store
of hams, tongues, bread, biscuit, and other articles
for our subsistence, in the course of our peregrination,
and Mr. Bramble, as gravely replied,
that he would take the hint into consideration: but,
finding no such provision was made, she now revived
the proposal, observing that there was a tolerable
market at Berwick, where we might be supplied; 
and that my man's horse would serve as a beast of
burden —The 'squire shrugging up his shoulders,
eyed her askance with a look of ineffable contempt; 
and after some pause, “Sister, (said he)
I can hardly persuade myself you are serious.” 
She was so little acquainted with the geography
of the island, that she imagined we could
not go to Scotland but by sea; and, after we had
passed through the town of Berwick, when he told 

her we were upon Scottish ground, she could hardly
believe the assertion —If the truth must be told,
the South Britons in general are woefully ignorant
in this particular. What, between want of curiosity,
and traditional sarcasms, the effect of ancient
animosity, the people at the other end of the island
know as little of Scotland as of Japan. 
If I had never been in Wales, I should have
been more struck with the manifest difference in
appearance betwix the peasants and commonalty
on different sides of the Tweed. The boors of
Northumberland are lusty fellows, fresh complexioned,
cleanly, and well cloathed; but the labourers
in Scotland are generally lank, lean, hard-featured,
sallow, soiled, and shabby, and their
little pinched blue caps have a beggarly effect. The
cattle are much in the same stile with their drivers,
meagre, stunted, and ill equipt. When I talked
to my uncle on this subject, he said, “Though
all the Scottish hinds would not bear to be compared
with those of the rich counties of South
Britain, they would stand very well in competition
with the peasants of France, Italy, and
Savoy—not to mention the mountaineers of
Wales, and the red-shanks of Ireland.” 
We entered Scotland by a frightful moor of sixteen
miles, which promises very little for the interior
parts of the kingdom; but the prospect mended
as we advanced. Passing through Dunbar,
which is a neat little town, situated on the sea-side,
we lay at a country inn, where our entertainment
far exceeded our expectation; but for this we cannot
give the Scot credit, as the landlord is a native
of England. Yesterday we dined at Haddington,
which has been a place of some consideration,
but is now gone to decay; and in the evening
arrived at this metropolis, of which I can say
very little. It is very romantic, from its situation 

on the declivity of a hill, having a fortified castle
at the top, and a royal palace at the bottom. The
first thing that strikes the nose of a stranger, shall be
nameless; but what first strikes the eye, is the unconscionable
height of the houses, which generally
rise to five, six, seven, and eight stories, and, in
some places, (as I am assured) to twelve. This
manner of building, attended with numberless inconveniences,
must have been originally owing to
want of room. Certain it is, the town seems to
be full of people: but their looks, their language,
and their customs, are so different from ours, that
I can hardly believe myself in Great-Britain. 
The inn at which we put up, (if it may be so
called) was so filthy and disagreeable in all respects.
that my uncle began to fret, and his gouty
symptom, to recur —Recollecting, however, that
he had a letter of recommendation to one Mr.
Mitchelson, a lawyer, he sent it by his servant, with
a compliment, importing that he would wait upon
him next day in person; but that gentleman visited
us immediately, and insisted upon our going to
his own house, until he could provide lodgings for
our accommodation. We gladly accepted of his
invitation, and repaired to his house, where we
were treated with equal elegance and hospitality,
to the utter confusion of our aunt, whose prejudices,
though beginning to give way, were not yet entirely
removed. To-day by the assistance of our
friend, we are settled in convenient lodgings, up
four pair of stairs, in the High-stret, the fourth
story being, in this city, reckoned more genteel
than the first. The air is, in all probability, the
better; but it requires good lungs to breathe it at
this distance above the surface of the earth. — 
While I do remain above it, whether higher or
lower; provided I breathe at all, 
I shall ever be, dear Phillips, yours,
J. Melford.
