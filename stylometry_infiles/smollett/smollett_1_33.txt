He appears in the great world with universal
applause and admiration. 
Mean while, Fathom and his engine
were busied in compleating his equipage,
so that in a few days, he had procured a
very gay chariot, adorned with painting, gilding
and a coat of arms, according to his own fancy
and direction: the first use he made of this
vehicle, was that of visiting the young nobleman
from whom he had received such important
civilities on the road, in consequence of
an invitation at parting, by which he learned
his title and the place of his abode in London. 
His lordship was not only pleased, but proud to
see such a stranger at his gate, and entertained
him with excess of complaisance and hospitality; 
insomuch, that by his means our hero soon became
acquainted with the whole circle of polite
company, by whom he was caressed for his insinuating
manners and agreeable conversation. 
He had thought proper to tell the nobleman
at their first interview in town, that his reasons
for concealing his knowledge of the English
tongue were now removed, and that he would
no longer deny himself the pleasure of speaking
a language which had been always music to
his ear: he had also thanked his lordship for
his generous interposition at the inn, which was
an instance of that generosity and true politeness,
which are engrossed by the English people, 

who leave nought to other nations but the
meer shadow of these virtues. 
A testimony like this from the mouth of
such a noble stranger, won the heart of the
peer, who professed a friendship for him on the
spot, and undertook to see justice done to his
lacquey, who in a short time was gratified with
a share of the seisure which had been made
upon his information, amounting to fifty or
sixty pounds. 
Ferdinand put not forth the whole strength
of his acomplishments at once, but contrived
to spring a new mine of qualification every
day, to the surprize and admiration of all his
acquaintance. He was gifted with a sort of
elocution, much more specious than solid, and
spoke on every subject that occurred in conversation,
with that familiarity and ease, which,
one would think, could only be acquired by
long study and application. This plausibility
and confidence, are faculties really inherited
from nature, and effectually serve the possessor,
in lieu of that learning, which is not to be obtained
without infinite toil and perseverance:
the most superficial tincture of the arts and
sciences in such a juggler, is sufficient to dazzle
the understanding of half mankind; and if
managed with circumspection, will enable him
even to spend his life among the literati, without
once forfeiting the character of a connoisseur. 
Our hero was perfectly master of this leger-demain,
which he carried to such a pitch of
assurance, as to declare in the midst of a mathematical
assembly, that he intended to gratify
the publick with a full confutation of Sir Isaac 

Newton's philosophy, to the nature of which
he was as much a stranger as the most savage
Hottentot in Afric. His pretensions to profound
and universal knowledge, were supported
not only by this kind of presumption, but also
by the facility with which he spoke so many
different languages, and the shrewd remarks
he had made in the course of his travels and
observation. 
Among politicians, he settled the balance of
power upon a certain footing, by dint of ingenious
schemes, which he had contrived for the
welfare of Europe. With officers, he reformed
the art of war, with improvements which had
occurred to his reflection, while he was engaged
in a military life. He sometimes held forth
upon painting, like a member of the Dillettanti
club: the theory of musick was a theme upon
which he seemed to expatiate with particular
pleasure: in the provinces of love and gallantry,
he was a perfect Oroondates: he possessed
a most agreeable manner of telling entertaining
stories, of which he had a large collection: he
sung with great melody and taste, and played
upon the violin with surprizing execution. 
To these qualifications, let us add his affability
and pliant disposition, and then the reader will
not wonder that he was looked upon as the
pattern of human perfection, and his acquaintance
courted accordingly. 
While he thus captivated the favour and affection
of the English nobility, he did not neglect
to take other measures in behalf of the
partnership to which he had subscribed. This
adventure with the two squires at Paris, had
weakened his appetite for play, which was not 

at all restored by the observations he had made
in London, where the art of gaming is reduced
into a regular system, and its professors so laudably
devoted to the discharge of their functions,
as to observe the most temperate regimen,
lest their invention should be impaired
by the fatigue of watching or exercise, and their
ideas disturbed by the fumes of indigestion. 
No Indian Brachman could live more abstemious
than two of the pack, who hunted in
couple, and kennelled in the upper apartments
of the hotel in which our adventurer lived:
they abstained from animal food with the abhorrence
of Pythagoreans, their drink was the
pure simple element, they were vomited once
a week, took physic or a glyster every third
day, spent the forenoon in algebraical calculations,
and slept from four o'clock till midnight,
that they might then take the field with
that cool serenity which is the effect of refreshment
and repose. 
These were terms upon which our hero
would not risque his fortune; he was too
much addicted to pleasure to forego every other
enjoyment but that of amassing; and did
not so much depend upon his dexterity in
play, as upon his talent of insinuation, which
by this time had succeeded so far beyond his
expectation, that he began to indulge the hope
of enslaving the heart of some rich heiress,
whose fortune would at once raise him above
all dependance. Indeed no man ever set out
with a fairer prospect on such an expedition; 
for, he had found means to render himself
so agreeable to the fair sex, that, like the boxes
of the play-house, during the representation of 

a new performance, his company was often
bespoke for a series of weeks; and no lady,
whether widow, wife, or maiden, ever mentioned
his name, without some epithet of esteem
or affection; such as the dear Count! the
charming Man! the Nonpareil! or the Angel! 
While he thus shone in the zerinth of admiration,
it is not be doubted, that he could
have melted some wealthy dowager or opulent
ward: but being an enemy to all precipitate
engagements, he resolved to act with great
care and deliberation in an affair of such importance,
especially as he did not find himself
hurried by the importunities of want: for
since his arrival in England, he had rather
increased than exhausted his finances, by methods
equally certain and secure. In a word,
he with the assistance of Ratchkali carried on
a traffick, which yielded great profits, without
subjecting the trader to the least loss or inconvenience. 
Fathom, for example, wore upon
his finger a large brilliant, which he played
to such advantage one night, at a certain nobleman's
house, where he was prevailed upon
to entertain the company with a solo on the
violin, that every body present took notice of
its uncommon lustre, and it was handed about
for the perusal of every individual. The water
and the workmanship were universally admired; 
and one among the rest, having expressed
a desire of knowing the value of such
a jewel, the count seized that opportunity of
entertaining them with a learned disquisition
into the nature of stones; this introduced the
history of the diamond in question, which he
said had been purchased of an Indian trader of
Fort St. George, at an under price; so that 

the present proprietor could afford to sell it
at a very reasonable rate; and concluded with
telling the company, that for his own part, he
had been importuned to wear it by the jeweller,
who imagined it would have a better chance
for attracting a purchaser on his finger, than
while it remained in his own custody. 
This declaration was no sooner made, than
a certain lady of quality, bespoke the refuse of
the jewel, and desired Ferdinand to send the
owner next day to her house, where he accordingly
waited upon her ladyship with the ring,
for which he received one hundred and fifty
guineas, two thirds of the sum being clear gain,
and equally divided betwixt the associates. 
Nor was this bargain such as reflected dishonour
upon the lady's taste, or could be productive
of ill consequences to the merchant: for
the method of estimating diamonds is altogether
arbitrary; and Ratchkali, who was an exquisite
lapidary, had set it in such a manner as
would have imposed upon any ordinary jeweller. 
By these means of introduction, the Tyroleze
soon monopolized the custom of a great
many noble families, upon which he levied
large contributions, without incurring the
least suspicion of deceit: he every day out of
pure esteem and gratitude for the honour of
their commands, entertained them with the
sight of some new trinket, which he was never
permitted to carry home, unsold; and from
the profits of each job, a tax was raised for the
benefit of our adventurer. 
Yet his indultos were not confined to the
article of jewels, which constituted only one
part of his revenue: by the industry of his understrapper, 

he procured a number of old
crazy fiddles, which were thrown aside as lumber; 
upon which he counterfeited the Cremona
mark, and otherwise cook'd them up with
great dexterity; so that when he had occasion
to regale the lovers of music, he would send
for one of these vamped instruments, and extract
from it such tones as quite ravished the
hearers; among whom there was always some
conceited pretender, who spoke in raptures of
the violin, and gave our hero an opportunity
of launching out in its praise, and declaring it
was the best Cremona he had ever touched. 
This encomium never failed to inflame the desires
of the audience, to some one of whom, he
was generous enough to part with it at prime
cost, that is, for twenty or thirty guineas clear
profit; for he was often able to oblige his
friends in this manner, because, being an eminent
connoisseur, his countenance was solicited
by all the musicians, who wanted to dispose of
such moveables. 
Nor did he neglect the other resources of a
skilful virtuoso. Every auction afforded some
picture, in which, though it had been overlooked
by the ignorance of the times, he recognized
the stile of a great master, and made
a merit of recommending it to some noble
friend. This commerce he likewise extended
to medals, bronzes, busts, intaglios and old china,
and kept divers artificers continually employed
in making antiques for the English
nobility. Thus he went on with such rapidity
of success in all his endeavours, that he himself
was astonished at the infatuation he had
produced. Nothing was so wretched among 

the productions of art, that he could not impose
upon the world as a capital performance; 
and so fascinated were the eyes of his admirers,
he could easily have persuaded them that
a barber's bason was an Etrurian Patera, and
the cover of a copper pot, no other than the
shield of Ancus Martius. In short, it was become
so fashionable to consult the count in
every thing relating to taste and politeness, that
not a plan was drawn, not even an house furnished
without his advice and approbation; 
nay, to such a degree did his reputation in these
matters excel, that a particular pattern of paper-hangings
was known by the name of Fathom; 
and his hall was every morning crouded
with upholsterers and other tradesmen, who
came by order of their employers, to learn his
choice, and take his directions. 
The character and influence he thus acquired
he took care to maintain with the utmost
assiduity and circumspection: he never failed
to appear the chief personage at all public diversions,
and private assemblies, not only in
conversation and dress, but also in the article
of dancing, in which he outstripped all his
fellows, as far as in every other genteel accomplishment.
