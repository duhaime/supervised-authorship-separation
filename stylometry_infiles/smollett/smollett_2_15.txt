Bath, April, 23. 
DEAR DOCTOR,
IF I did not know that the exercise of your
profession has habituated you to the hearing of
complaints, I should make a conscience of troubling
you with my correspondence, which may be truly
called the lamentations of Matthew Bramble. Yet
I cannot help thinking, I have some right to discharge
the overflowings of my spleen upon you,
whose province it is to remove those disorders that
occasioned it; and let me tell you, it is no small
allevation of my grievances, that I have a sensible
friend to whom I can communicate my crusty
humours, which, by retention, would grow intolerably
acrimonious. 
You must know, I find nothing but disappointment
at Bath; which is so altered, that I can scarce
believe it is the same place that I frequented about
thirty years ago. Methinks I hear you say,
“Altered it is, without all doubt; but then it is
altered for the better; a truth which, perhaps
you would own without hesitation, if you yourself
was not altered for the worse.” The reflection
may, for aught I know, be just. The inconveniences
which I overlooked in the high-day of
health, will naturally strike with exaggerated impression
on the irritable nerves of an invalid, surprised
by premature old age, and shattered with
long-suffering—But, I believe, you will not deny,
that this place, which Nature and Providence
seem to have intended as a resource from distemper
and disquiet, is become the very centre of racket
and dissipation. Instead of that peace, tranquillity 

and ease, so necessary to those who labour under
bad health, weak nerves, and irregular spirits; 
here we have nothing but noise, tumult, and hurry; 
with the fatigue and slavery of maintaining a ceremonial,
more stiff, formal, and oppressive, than
the etiquette of a German elector. A national
hospital it may be; but one would imagine, that
none but lunaticks are admitted; and truly, I will
give you leave to call me so, If I stay much longer
at Bath. —But I shall take another opportunity to
explain my sentiment at greater length on this subject
—I was impatient to see the boasted improvements
in architecture, for which the upper parts
of the town have been so much celebrated, and,
t'other day I made a circuit of all the new buildings. 
The Square, though irregular, is, on the whole
pretty well laid out, spacious, open, and airy; and,
in my opinion, by far the most wholsome and agreeable
situation in Bath, especially the upper side of
it; but the avenues to it are mean, dirty, dangerous,
and indirect. Its communication with the
Baths, is through the yard of an inn, where the
poor trembling valetudinarian is carried in a chair,
betwixt the heels of a double row of horses, wincing
under the curry-combs of grooms and postilions,
over and above the hazard of being obstructed, or
overturned by the carriages which are continually
making their exit or their entrance—I suppose after
some chairmen shall have been maimed, and a few
lives lost by those accidents, the corporation will
think in earnest about providing a more safe and
commodious passage. The Circus is a pretty banble; 
contrived for shew, and looks like Vespasian's
amphitheatre turned outside in. If we consider it
in point of magnificence, the great number of small
doors belonging to the separate houses, the inconsiderable
height of the different orders, the affected
ornaments of the architrave, which are both childish 

and misplaced, and the areas projecting into the
street, surrounded with iron rails, destroy a good
part of its effect upon the eye; and, perhaps, we
shall find it still more defective, if we view it in the
light of convenience. The figure of each seperate
dwelling house, being the segment of a circle, must
spoil the symmetry of the rooms, by contracting
them towards the street windows, and leaving a
larger sweep in the space behind. If instead of the
areas and iron rails, which seem to be of very little
use, there had been a corridore with arcades all
round, as in Covent-Garden, the appearance of the
whole would have been more magnificent and striking; 
those arcades would have afforded an agreeable
covered walk, and sheltered the poor chairmen and
their carriages from the rain, which is here almost
perpetual. At present, the chairs stand soaking in
the open street, from morning to night, till they
become so many boxes of weat leather, for the benefit
of the gouty and rheumatic, who are transported
in them from place to place. Indeed this is
a shocking inconvenience, that extends over the
whole city; and, I am persuaded, it produces infinite
mischief to the delicate and infirm; even the
close chairs, contrived for the sick, by standing in
the open air, have their frize linings impregnated
like so many spunges, with the moisture of the atmosphere,
and those cases of cold vapour must give
a charming check to the perspiration of a patient,
piping hot from the Bath, with all his pores wide
open. 
But, to return to the Circus: it is inconvenient
from its situation, at so great a distance from all the
markets, baths, and places of public entertainment. 
The only entrance to it, through Gay-street, is
so difficult, steep, and slippery, that, in wet weather,
it must be exceedingly dangerous, both for
those that ride in carriages, and those that walk 

a-foot; and when the street is covered with snow,
as it was for fifteen days successively this very winter,
I don't see how any individual could go either
up or down, without the most imminent hazard of
broken bones. In blowing weather, I am told,
most of the houses in this hill are smothered with
smoke, forced down the chimneys, by the gusts of
wind reverberated from the hill behind, which (I
apprehend likewise) must render the atmosphere
here more humid and unwholsome than it is in the
square below; for the clouds, formed by the constant
evaporation from the baths and rivers in the
bottom, will, in their ascent this way, be first attracted
and detained by the hill that rises close behind
the Circus, and load the air with a perpetual
succession of vapours: this point, however, may
be easily ascertained by means of an hygrometer, or
a paper of salt of tartar exposed to the action of the
atmosphere. The same artist, who planned the
Circus, has likewise projected a Crescent; when
that is finished, we shall probably have a star; and
those who are living thirty years hence, may perhaps,
see all the signs of the Zodiac exhibited in
architecture at Bath. These, however fantastical,
are still designs that denote some ingenuity and
knowledge in the architect; but the rage of building
has laid hold on such a number of adventurers,
that one sees new houses starting up in every outlet
and every corner of Bath; contrived without judgment,
executed without solidity, and stuck together
with so little regard to plan and propriety, that the
different lines of the new rows and buildings interfere
with, and intersect one another in every different
angle of conjunction. They look like the
wreck of streets and squares disjointed by an earthquake,
which hath broken the ground into a variety
of holes and hillocks; or, as if some Gothic devil
had stuffed them altogether in a bag, and left them 

to stand higgledy piggledy, just as chance directed. 
What sort of a monster Bath will become in a few
years, with those growing excrescences, may be
easily conceived: but the want of beauty and proportion
is not the worst effect of these new mansions; 
they are built so slight, with the soft crumbling
stone found in this neighbourhood, that I should
never sleep quietly in one of them, when it blowed
(as the sailors say) a cap-full of wind; and, I am
persuaded, that my hind, Roger Williams, or any
man of equal strength, would be able to push his
foot through the strongest part of their walls, without
any great exertion of his muscles. All these absurdities
arise from the general tide of luxury, which
hath overspread the nation, and swept away all,
even the very dregs of the people. Every upstart
of fortune, harnassed in the trappings of the mode,
presents himself at Bath, as in the very focus of observation
—Clerks and factors from the East Indies,
loaded with the spoil of plundered provinces; planters,
negro-drivers, and hucksters, from our American
plantations, enriched they know not how; 
agents, commissaries, and contractors, who have
fattened, in two successive wars, on the blood of
the nation; usurers, brokers, and jobbers of every
kind; men of low birth, and no breeding, have
found themselves suddenly translated into a state of
affluence, unknown to former ages; and no wonder
that their brains should be intoxicated with pride,
vanity, and presumption. Knowing no other criterion
of greatness, but the ostentation of wealth,
they discharge their affluence without taste or conduct,
through every channel of the most absurd extravagance:
and all of them hurry to Bath because
here, without any further qualification, they can
mingle with the princes and nobles of the land. 
Even the wives and daughters of low tradesmen,
who, like shovel-nosed sharks, prey upon the blubber 

of those uncouth whales of fortune, are infected
with the same rage of displaying their importance; 
and the slightest indisposition serves them for a pretext
to insist upon being conveyed to Bath, where
they may hobble country dances and cotillons among
lordlings, 'squires, counsellors, and clergy. These
delicate creatures from Bedfordbury, Butcher-row,
Crutched-Friars, and Botolph-lane, cannot Breathe
in the gross air of the Lower Town, or conform to
the vulgar rules of a common lodging-house; the
husband, therefore, must provide an entire house,
or elegant apartments in the new buildings. Such
is the composition of what is called the fashionable
company at Bath; where a very inconsiderable proportion
of genteel people are lost in a mob of impudent
plebeians, who have neither understanding nor
judgment, nor the least idea of propriety and decorum; 
and seem to enjoy nothing so much as an
opportunity of insulting their betters. 
Thus the number of people, and the number of
houses, continue to increase; and this will ever be
the case, till the streams that swell this irresistible
torrent of folly and extravagance, shall either be
exhausted, or turned into other channels, by incidents
and events which I do not pretend to foresee. 
This, I own, is a subject on which I cannot write
with any degree of patience; for the mob is a
monster I never could abide, either in its head, tail,
midriff, or members: I detest the whole of it, as a
mass of ignorance, presumption, malice, and brutality; 
and, in this term of reprobation, I include,
without respect of rank, station, or quality, all
those of both sexes, who affect its manners, and
court its society. 
But I have written till my fingers are crampt,
and my nausea begins to return—By your advice, I
sent to London a few days ago for half a pound of
Gengzeng; though I doubt much, whether that 

which comes from America is equally efficacious
with what is brought from the East Indies. Some
years ago, a friend of mine paid sixteen guineas for
two ounces of it; and, in six months after, it was
sold in the same shop for five shillings the pound. 
In short, we live in a vile world of fraud and sophistication; 
so that I know nothing of equal value
with the genuine friendship of a sensible man; a
rare jewel! which I cannot help thinking myself in
possession of, while I repeat the old declaration,
that I am, as usual, 
Dear Lewis,
Your affectionate
M. Bramble. 
After having been agitated in a short hurricane, on
my first arrival, I have taken a small house in
Misham-street, where I am tolerably well lodged,
for five guineas a week. I was yesterday at
the Pump-room, and drank about a pint of the
water, which seems to agree with my stomach; 
and to-morrow morning I shall bathe, for the
first time; so that in a few posts you may expect
farther trouble; mean while, I am glad to find
that the inoculation has succeeded so well with
poor Joyce, and that her face will be but little
marked—If my friend Sir Thomas was a single
man, I would not trust such a handsome wench
in his family; but as I have recommended her,
in a particular manner, to the protection of lady
G&wblank;, who is one of the best women in the
world, she may go thither without hesitation, as
soon as she is quite recovered, and fit for service— 
Let her mother have money to provide her with
necessaries, and she may ride behind her brother
on Bucks; but you must lay strong injunctions on
Jack, to take particular care of his trusty old
veteran, who has faithfully earned his present
case, by his past services.
