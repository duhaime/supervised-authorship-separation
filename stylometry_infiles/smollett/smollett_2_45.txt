MRS. GWYLLIM,
I CAN'T help thinking it very strange, that I
never had an answer to the letter I wrote you
some weeks ago from Bath, concerning the four
bear, the gander, and the maids eating butter, 

which I won't allow to be wasted—We are now
going upon a long gurney to the north, whereby
I desire you will redouble your care and circumflexion,
that the family may be well manged in
our absence; for, you know, you must render account,
not only to your earthly master, but also
to him that is above: and if you are found a good
and faithful sarvant, great will be your reward in
heaven. I hope there will be twenty stun of cheese
ready for market by the time I get huom, and as
much owl spun, as will make half a dozen pair of
blankets; and that the savings of the butter-milk
will fetch me a good penny before Martinmass, as
the two pigs are to be fed for baking with bitchmast
and acrons. 
I wrote to doctor Lews for the same purpuss,
but he never had the good manners to take the
least notice of my letter; for which reason, I shall
never favour him with another, though he beshits
me on his bended knees. You will do well to
keep a watchfull eye over the hind Villiams, who
is one of his amissories, and, I believe, no better
than he should be at bottom. God forbid that I
should lack christian charity; but charity begins
at huom, and sure nothing can be a more charitable
work than to rid the family of such vermine. 
I do suppose, that the brindled cow has been had
to the parson's bull, that old Moll has had another
litter of pigs, and that Dick is become a mighty
mouser. Pray order every thing for the best, and
be frugal, and keep the maids to their labour. — 
If I had a private opportunity, I would send them
some hymns to sing instead of profane ballads; but,
as I can't, they and you must be contented with
the prayers of 
your assured friend,
T. Bramble. 
London, June 14.
