I am entertained by Mr. Crab—a description
of him—I acquire the art of surgery
—consult Crab's disposition—become
necessary to him—an accident happens
—he advises me to launch out into the world
—assists me with money—I set out for
London. 
The fumes of my resentment being dissipated,
as well as the vanity of my success, I
found myself deserted to all the horrors of extreme
want, and avoided by mankind as a creature
of a different species, or rather as a solitary
being, no ways comprehended within the
scheme or protection of providence. My despair 

had rendered me almost quite stupified, when I
was one day told, that a gentleman desired to see
me, at a certain publick house, whither immediately
I repaired; and was introduced to one
Mr. Launcelot Crab a surgeon in town, who
was engaged with two more, in drinking a liquor
called pop-in, composed by tossing a quartern of
brandy into a quart of small beer. —Before
I relate the occasion of this message, I believe
it will not be disagreeable to the reader, if
I describe the gentleman who sent for me, and
mention some circumstances of his character and
conduct, which may illustrate what follows, and
account for his behaviour to me. 
This member of the faculty was aged fifty, about
five foot high, and ten round the belly; his
face was capacious as a full moon, and much of
the complexion of a mulberry: his nose resembling
a powder-horn, was swelled to an enormous
size, and studded all over with carbuncles; 
and his little grey eyes reflected the rays in such
an oblique manner, that while he looked a person
full in the face, one would have imagined
he was admiring the buckle of his shoe. —He
had long entertained an implacable resentment against
Potion, who, tho' a younger practitioner,
had engrossed more business than he, and once
had the assurance to perform a cure, whereby he
disappointed and disgraced the prognostic of the
said Crab. —This quarrel, which was at one time
upon the point of being made up, by the interposition
and mediation of friends, had been lately
inflamed beyond a possibility of reconciliation by
the respective wives of the opponents, who, chancing
to meet at a christening, disagreed about precedence,
proceeded from invectives to blows, 

and were with great difficulty, by the gossips, prevented
from converting the occasion of joy, into
a scene of blood. 
The difference between these rivals was in the
height of rancour, when I was sent for by Crab,
who received me as civilly as I could have expected
from one of his disposition; and after desiring
me to sit, enquired into the particulars of
my leaving the house of Potion; which when I
had related, he said with a malicious grin,— 
“Here's a sneaking dog! —I always thought
him a fellow without a soul, d&wblank;n me!— 
a canting scoundrel, who has crept into business
by his hypocrisy, and kissing the a&wblank;se of
every body.” —“Ay, ay, (says another)
one might see with half an eye, that the rascal
has no honesty in him, by his going so regularly
to church.” This sentence was confirmed
by the third, who assured his companions,
that Potion was never known to be
disguised in liquor but once, at a meeting of
the godly, where he had distinguished himself
by an extempore prayer an hour long. — 
After this preamble, Crab addressed himself to me
in these words, “Well, my lad, I have heard
a good character of you, and I'll do for you. 
—You may send your things to my
house when you please. —I have given
orders for your reception. —Z&blank;ds! what
does the booby stare at? —If you have no
mind to embrace my courteous offer, you
may let it alone and be d&sblank;n'd.” —I answered
with 'a submissive bow, that I was far
from rejecting his friendly offer, of which I would
immediately avail myself, as soon as he should 

inform me, on what footing I should be entertained. 
—“What footing (d&wblank;n my
blood, cried he) d'ye expect to have a footman
and couple of horses kept for you?” — 
No, Sir (I replied) my expectations are not
quite so sanguine. —That I may be as little burthensome
as possible, I would willingly serve in
your shop, by which means I may save you the
expence of a journey-man, or porter at least,
for I understand a little pharmacy, having employed
some of my leisure hours in the practice of
that art, while I lived with Mr. Potion: neither
am I altogether ignorant of surgery, which
I have studied with great pleasure and application. 
—“O ho! you did (says Crab.) Gentlemen,
here is a compleat artist! —Studied
surgery! what? in books I suppose. —I shall have you disputing with me, one of these
days, on points of my profession. —You can
already account for muscular motion (I warrant)
and explain the mystery of the brain
and nerves—ha! —You are too learned for
me, d&wblank;n me. —But let's hear no more of this
stuff,—can you bleed and give a clyster,
spread a plaister and prepare a potion? answer
me to that.” —Upon my answering him
in the affirmative, he shook his head, telling me,
he believed he should have little good of me, for
all my promises;—but however, he would take
me in for the sake of charity. —I was accordingly
that very night admitted to his house, and had
an apartment assigned to me in the garret, which
I was fain to put up with, notwithstanding the
mortification my pride suffered in this change
of circumstances. I was soon convinced of the
real motives which induced Crab to receive me 

in this manner: for besides the gratification of
his revenge, in exposing the selfishness of his
antagonist, in opposition to his own generosity,
which was all affectation, he had occasion for a
young man who understood something of the
profession, to fill up the place of his eldest apprentice,
lately dead, not without violent suspicion
of foul play from his master's brutality. — 
The knowledge of this, together with his daily
behaviour to his wife, and the young apprentice,
did not at all contribute to my enjoying my new
situation with ease; however, as I did not perceive
how I could bestow myself to better advantage,
I resolved to study Crab's temper
with all the application, and manage it with all
the address I was master of. —And it was not
long before I found out a strange peculiarity of
humour, which governed his behaviour towards
all his dependants. —I observed when he was
pleased, he was such a niggard of his satisfaction,
that if his wife or servants betrayed the leaft
symptom of participation, he was offended to an
insupportable degree of choler and fury, the effects
of which they seldom failed to feel. —And when
his indignation was roused, submission and soothing
always exasperated it beyond the bounds of reason
and humanity. —I therefore pursued a contrary
plan; and one day, when he honoured me
with the names of ignorant whelp and lazy ragamuffin
—I boldly replied, I was neither ignorant
nor lazy, since I both understood, and performed
my business as well as he could do for his soul:
neither was it just to call me ragamuffin, for I
had a whole coat on my back, and was descended
from a better family than any he could boast an
alliance with. He gave tokens of great amazement 

at this assurance of mine, and shook his
cane over my head, regarding me all the time
with a countenance truly diabolical. Although I
was terribly startled at his menacing looks and
posture, I yet had reflection enough left, to convince
me, I had gone too far to retract, and
that this was the critical minute which must decide
my future lot, in his service; whereupon I
snatched up the pestle of a mortar, and swore if
he offered to strike me without cause, I would
see whether his scull or my weapon was
hardest. —He continued silent for some time,
and at last broke forth into these ejaculations,— 
“This is fine usage from a servant to a master,
—very fine!—damnation!—but,
no matter, you shall pay for this, you dog,
you shall. —I'll do your business—yes,
yes, I'll teach you to lift your hand against
me.” —So saying, he retired and lest me under
dreadful apprehensions, which vanished intirely at
our next meeting, when he behaved with unusual
complacency, and treated me with a glass of
punch after dinner. —By this conduct, I got the
ascendency over him in a short time, and became
so necessary to him, in managing his business
while he was engaged at the bottle, that fortune
began to wear a kinder aspect with regard
to me; and I consoled myself for the disregard
of my former acquaintance, with the knowledge
I daily imbibed, by a close application to the duties
of my employment, in which I succeeded beyond
my own expectation. —I was on very good
terms with my master's wife, whose esteem I acquired
and cultivated, by representing Mrs. Potion
in the most ridiculous lights my satirical talents
could invent, as well as by rendering her some 

christian offices, when she had been too familiar
with the dram bottle, to which she had often times
recourse for consolation, under the affliction she
suffered from a barbarous husband. —In this manner
I lived, without hearing the least tidings of
my uncle, for the space of two years, during
which time I kept little or no company, being
neither in a humour to relish, nor in a capacity
to maintain much acquaintance: for the Nabal
my master allowed me no wages; and the small
perquisites of my station scarce supplied me with
the common necessaries of life. —I was no longer,
a pert, unthinking coxcomb, giddy with popular
applause, and elevated with the extravagance
of hope; my misfortunes had taught me how
little the caresses of the world during a man's
prosperity, are to be valued by him; and how seriously
and expeditiously he ought to set himself about
making himself independent of them. My
present appearance, therefore, was the least of my
care, which was wholly engrossed in laying up
a stock of instruction that might secure me against
the caprice of fortune for the future. 
I became such a sloven, and contracted such an
air of austerity, that every body pronounced me
crest-fallen; and Gawky returned to town without
running any risk from my resentment, which
was by this time pretty much cooled, and restrained
by prudential reasons, so effectually, that
I never so much as thought of obtaining satisfaction
for the injuries he had done me. —When I
deemed myself sufficiently master of my business,
I began to cast about for an opportunity of
launching into the world, in hopes of finding
some provision, that might make amends for the
difficulties I had undergone: but, as this could 

not be effected without a small sum of money to
equip me for the field, I was in the utmost perplexity
how to raise it, well knowing, that Crab,
for his own sake, would never put me in a condition
to leave him, when his interest was so
much concerned in my stay. —But a small accident,
which happened about this time, determined
him in my favour. This was no other
than the pregnancy of his maid servant, who declared
her situation to me, assuring me at the
same time, that I was the occasion of it. Although
I had no reason to question the truth of
this imputation, I was not ignorant of the familiarities
which had passed between her master and
her; of which availing myself, I represented to
her the folly of laying the burthen at my door,
when she might dispose of it to much greater advantage
with Mr. Crab: She listened to my advice,
and next day acquainted him with the pretended
success of their mutual endeavour. —He was far
from being over-joyed at this proof of his vigour,
which he foresaw might have very troublesome
consequences; not that he dreaded any domestic
grumblings and reproaches from his wife,
whom he kept in perfect subjection; but because
he knew it would furnish his rival Potion with a
handle for insulting and undermining his reputation,
there being no scandal equal to that of uncleanness,
in the opinion of those who inhabit
that part of the island where he lived. —He therefore
took a resolution worthy of himself,
which was, to persuade the girl, that she was
not with child, but only afflicted with a disorder
incident to young women, which he could easily
remove: with this view (as he pretended) he prescribed
for her such medicines, as he thought 

would infallibly procure abortion; but in this he
was disappointed, for the maid being advertised
by me of his design, and at the same time well satisfied
with her own condition, absolutely refused to
follow his directions; and threatened to publish
her situation to the world, if he did not immediately
take some method of providing for the
important occasion, which she expected in a few
months. —I was not long before I guessed the
result of his deliberation, by his addressing himself
to me (one day) in this manner: “I am
surprised, that a young fellow like you, discovers
no inclination to push his fortune in
the world. —By G&sblank;d, before I was of your
age, I was broiling on the coast of Guinea. — 
Damme! what's to hinder you from profiting
by the war, which will certainly be declared in a
short time against Spain? —You may easily get
on board of a king's ship in quality of a surgeon's
mate, where you will certainly see a great deal of
practice, and stand a good chance of getting
prize money.” —I laid hold of this declaration,
which I had long wished for, and assured him I
would follow his advice with pleasure, if it was
in my power; but that it was impossible for me,
to embrace an opportunity of that kind, having
no friend to advance a little money, to supply me
with what necessaries I should want, and defray
the expences of my journey to London. —He told
me, that few necessaries were required; and as for
the expence of my journey, he would lend me money,
not only for that purpose, but also to maintain
me comfortably in London, until I should procure
a warrant for my provision aboard ship. —I gave
him a thousand thanks for his obliging offer (although
I was very well apprized of his motive, 

which was to make his chamber-maid lay the
child to me after I was gone; and accordingly
set out in a few weeks for London; my whole
fortune consisting of one suit of cloaths, half a
dozen ruffled shirts, as many plain, two pair
worsted stockings, as many thread; a case of
pocket instruments, a small edition of Horace,
Wiseman's surgery, and ten guineas in cash; for
which Crab took my bond, bearing 5 per cent.
interest; at the same time giving me a letter to
the member of parliament for our town, which
he said would do my business.
