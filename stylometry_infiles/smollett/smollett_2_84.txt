GOOD MRS. GWYLIM,
HEAVEN, for wife purposes hath ordained
that I should change my name and citation in life,
so that I am not to be considered any more as manger
of my brother's family: but as I cannot surrender
up my stewardship till I have settled with you
and Williams, I desire you will get your accunts
ready for inspection, as we are coming home without
further delay. —My spouse, the captain, being
subject to rummaticks, I beg you will take
great care to have the blew chamber, up two pair
of stairs well warmed for his reception. —Let the
sashes be secured, the crevices stopt, the carpets
laid and the beds well tousled. Mrs. Loyd, late
Jenkins, being married to a relation of the family,
cannot remain in the capacity of a sarvant; therefore,
I wish you would cast about for some creditable
body to be with me in her room —If she can
spin, and is mistress of plain-work, so much the
better—but she must not expect extravagant wages
—having a family of my own, I must be more occumenical 

than ever. No more at present, but
rests 
Your loving friend,
Tab. Lismahago.
