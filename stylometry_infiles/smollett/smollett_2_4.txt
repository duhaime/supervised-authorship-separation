DEAR MOLLY,
HEAVING this importunity, I send my love
to you and Saul, being in good health, and hoping
to heer the same from you; and that you and Saul
will take my poor kitten to bed with you this cold
weather. —We have been all in a sad taking here at
Glostar—Miss Liddy had like to have run away
with a player-man, and young master and he would
adone themselves a mischief; but the squire applied
to the mare, and they were bound over. —Mistress
bid me not speak a word of the matter to any Christian
soul—no more I shall: for we servints should
see all and say nothing—But what was worse than
all this, Chowder has had the misfortune to be
worried by a butcher's dog, and came home in a
terrible pickle—Mistriss was taken with the asterisks,
but they soon went off. The docter was
sent for to Chowder, and he subscribed a repository,
which did him great service—thank God he's now
in a fair way to do well—pray take care of my box
and the pillyber, and put them under your own bed; 
for, I do suppose, madam Gwyllim will be a prying
into my secrets, now my back is turned, John
Thomas is in good health, but sulky. The squire
gave away an ould coat to a poor man; and John
says as how tis robbing him of his parquisites. —I
told him, by his agreement he was to receive no
vails; but he says as how there's a difference betwixt
vails and parquisites; and so there is for
sartain. We are all going to the Hot Well, 

where I shall drink your health in a glass of water,
being, 
Dear Molly,
Your humble servant to command,
Win. Jenkins. 
Glostar, April 2d.
