Before I had got half-way
down the street, I changed my
mind: as I am at Versailles, thought
I, I might as well take a view of the
town; so I pull'd the cord, and ordered
the coachman to drive round
some of the principal streets—I suppose
the town is not very large, said
I. —The coachmen begg'd pardon for
setting me right, and told me it was
very superb, and that numbers of the
first dukes and marquises and counts
had hotels—The Count de B****, of 

whom the bookseller at the Quai de
Conti had spoke so handsomely the
night before, came instantly into my
mind. —And why should I not go,
thought I, to the Count de B****,
who has so high an idea of English
books and Englishmen, and tell
him my story? so I changed my
mind a second time—In truth it was
the third; for I had intended that day
for Madame de R**** in the Rue
St. Pierre, and had devoutly sent her
word by her fille de chambre that I
would assuredly wait upon her—but
I am govern'd by circumstances—I
cannot govern them: so seeing a man
standing with a basket on the other
side of the street, as if he had something
to sell, I bid La Fleur go up 

to him and enquire for the Count's
hotel. 
La Fleur return'd a little pale; and
told me it was a Chevalier de St.
Louis selling patès—It is impossible,
La Fleur! said I. —La Fleur could no
more account for the phenomenon
than myself; but persisted in his
story: he had seen the croix set in
gold, with its red ribband, he said, tied
to his button-hole—and had look'd
into the basket, and seen the patès
which the Chevalier was selling; so
could not be mistaken in that. 
Such a reverse in man's life awakens
a better principle than curiosity: I
could not help looking for some time 

at him as I sat in the remise—the
more I look'd at him, his croix, and
his basket, the stronger they wove
themselves into my brain—I got out
of the remise and went towards him. 
He was begirt with a clean linen
apron which fell below his knees, and
with a sort of a bib went half way
up his breast; upon the top of this,
but a little below the hem, hung his
croix. His basket of little patés was
cover'd over with a white damask
napkin; another of the same kind
was spread at the bottom; and there
was a look of propreté and neatness
throughout, that one might have
bought his patés of him as much
from appetite as sentiment. 

He made an offer of them to neither; 
but stood still with them at the
corner of a hotel, for those to buy
who chose it without solicitation. 
He was about forty-eight—of a
sedate look, something approaching
to gravity. —I did not wonder. —I
went up rather to the basket than
him, and having lifted up the napkin,
and taking one of his patés into
my hand, I begg'd he would explain
the appearance which affected me. 
He told me in a few words, that
the best part of his life had pass'd in
the service, in which, after spending
a small patrimony, he had obtain'd
a company and the croix with it; 

but that at the conclusion of the last
peace, his regiment being reformed,
and the whole corps, with those of
some other regiments, left without any
provision, he found himself in a
wide world without friends, without
a livre—and indeed, said he, without
any thing but this—(pointing, as
he said it, to his croix)—The poor
chevalier won my pity, and he finish'd
the scene with winning my esteem
too. 
The king, he said, was the most
generous of princes, but his generosity
could neither relieve or reward
every one, and it was only his misfortune
to be amongst the number. 
He had a little wife, he said, whom 

he loved, who did the patisserie; and
added, he felt no dishonour in defending
her and himself from want in this
way—unless Providence had offer'd
him a better. 
It would be wicked to with-hold a
pleasure from the good, in passing
over what happen'd to this poor
Chevalier of St. Louis about nine
months after. 
It seems he usually took his stand
near the iron gates which lead up to
the palace, and as his croix had
caught the eye of numbers, numbers
had made the same enquiry
which I had done—He had told
them the same story, and always with 

so much modesty and good sense,
that it had reach'd at last the king's
ears—who hearing the Chevalier
had been a gallant officer, and respected
by the whole regiment as a
man of honour and integrity, he
broke up his little trade by a pension
of fifteen hundred livres a year. 
As I have told this to please the
reader, I beg he will allow me to
relate another, out of its order, to
please myself—the two stories reflect
light upon each other, and 'tis a pity
they should be parted.
