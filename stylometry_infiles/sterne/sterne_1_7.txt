When a man is discontented
with himself, it has one advantage
however, that it puts him
into an excellent frame of mind for
making a bargain. Now there being
no travelling through France and
Italy without a chaise—and nature
generally prompting us to the thing
we are fittest for, I walk'd out into
the coach yard to buy or hire something
of that kind to my purpose:
an old *  Desobligeant in the furthest
corner of the court, hit my fancy at
first sight, so I instantly got into it, 

and finding it in tolerable harmony
with my feelings, I ordered the
waiter to call Monsieur Dessein the
master of the hôtel—but Monsieur
Dessein being gone to vespers, and
not caring to face the Franciscan
whom I saw on the opposite side of
the court, in conference with a lady
just arrived, at the inn —I drew the
taffeta curtain betwixt us, and being
determined to write my journey, I
took out my pen and ink, and wrote
the preface to it in the Desobligeant.
