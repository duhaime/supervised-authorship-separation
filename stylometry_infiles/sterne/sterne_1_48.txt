When states and empires have
their periods of declension,
and feel in their turns what distress
and poverty is—I stop not to tell
the causes which gradually brought
the house d'E**** in Britany
into decay. The Marquis d'E**** 
had fought up against his condition
with great firmness; wishing to preserve,
and still shew to the world,
some little fragments of what his ancestors
had been—their indiscretions
had put it out of his power. There 

was enough left for the little exigencies
of obscurity—But he had two boys
who look'd up to him for light—he
thought they deserved it. —He had
tried his sword—it could not open
the way—the mounting was too expensive
—and simple œconomy was
not a match for it—there was no resource
but commerce. 
In any other province in France,
save Britany, this was smiting the
root for ever of the little tree his
pride and affection wish'd to see reblossom
—But in Britany, there being
a provision for this, he avail'd himself
of it; and taking an occasion when
the states were assembled at Rennes, 

the Marquis, attended with his two
boys, enter'd the court; and having
pleaded the right of an ancient law
of the duchy, which, though seldom
claim'd, he said, was no less in force; 
he took his sword from his side— 
Here, said he, take it; and be trusty
guardians of it, till better times put
me in condition to reclaim it. 
The president accepted the Marquis's
sword—he stay'd a few minutes
to see it deposited in the archives of
his house, and departed. 
The Marquis and his whole family
embarked the next day for Martinico,
and in about nineteen or twenty
years of successful application to business, 

with some unlook'd-for bequests
from distant branches of his
house—return'd home to reclaim his
nobility and to support it. 
It was an incident of good fortune
which will never happen to any
traveller but a sentimental one, that
I should be at Rennes at the very
time of this solemn requisition: I
call it solemn—it was so to me. 
The Marquis enter'd the court with
his whole family: he supported his
lady—his eldest son supported his
sister, and his youngest was at the other
extreme of the line next his mother
—he put his handkerchief to his
face twice— 

—There was a dead silence. When
the Marquis had approach'd within
six paces of the tribunal, he gave the
Marchioness to his youngest son, and
advancing three steps before his family
—he reclaim'd his sword. His
sword was given him, and the moment
he got it into his hand he drew it almost
out of the scabbard—'twas the
shining face of a friend he had once
given up—he look'd attentively along
it, beginning at the hilt, as if to see
whether it was the same—when observing
a little rust which it had contracted
near the point, he brought it
near his eye, and bending his head
down over it, I think I saw a tear
fall upon the place: I could not be
deceived by what followed. 

“I shall find,” said he, “some
other way, to get it off.” 
When the Marquis had said this,
he return'd his sword into its scabbard,
made a bow to the guardians of it— 
and, with his wife and daughter and
his two sons following him, walk'd
out. 
O how I envied him his feelings!
