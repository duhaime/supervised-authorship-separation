I never finished a twelve-guinea
bargain so expeditiously in my
life: my time seemed heavy upon
the loss of the lady, and knowing
every moment of it would be as
two, till I put myself into motion 
—I ordered post horses directly, and
walked towards the hotel. 
Lord! said I, hearing the town
clock strike four, and recollecting
that I had been little more than a
single hour in Calais— 

—What a large volume of adventures
may be grasped within this
little span of life by him who interests
his heart in every thing, and
who, having eyes to see, what time
and chance are perpetually holding
out to him as he journeyeth on his
way, misses nothing he can fairly lay
his hands on.— 
—If this won't turn out something
—another will—no matter—'tis an
assay upon human nature —I get my
labour for my pains—'tis enough— 
the pleasure of the experiment has
kept my senses, and the best part of
my blood awake, and laid the gross
to sleep. 

I pity the man who can travel
from Dan to Beersheba, and cry, 'Tis
all barren—and so it is; and so is all
the world to him who will not cultivate
the fruits it offers. I declare,
said I, clapping my hands chearily
together, that was I in a desart, I
would find out wherewith in it to call
forth my affections —If I could not
do better, I would fasten them upon
some sweet myrtle, or seek some melancholy
cypress to connect myself
to —I would court their shade, and
greet them kindly for their protection 
—I would cut my name upon
them, and swear they were the loveliest
trees throughout the desert: if
their leaves wither'd, I would teach 

myself to mourn, and when they rejoiced,
I would rejoice along with
them. 
The learned Smelfungus travelled
from Boulogne to Paris—from
Paris to Rome—and so on—but he
set out with the spleen and jaundice,
and every object he pass'd by was
discoloured or distorted —He wrote
an account of them, but 'twas nothing
but the account of his miserable feelings. 
I met Smelfungus in the grand
portico of the Pantheon—he was just
coming out of it —'Tis nothing but
a huge cock-pit* , said he —I wish you
had said nothing worse of the Venus 

of Medicis, replied I—for in passing
through Florence, I had heard he
had fallen foul upon the goddess,
and used her worse than a common
strumpet, without the least provocation
in nature. 
I popp'd upon Smelfungus again
at Turin, in his return home; and
a sad tale of sorrowful adventures
had he to tell, “wherein he spoke of
moving accidents by flood and field,
and of the cannibals which each
other eat: the Anthropophagi”— 
he had been flea'd alive, and bedevil'd,
and used worse than St. Bartholomew,
at every stage he had come
at— 

—I'll tell it, cried Smelfungus, to
the world. You had better tell it,
said I, to your physician. 
Mundungus, with an immense fortune,
made the whole tour; going
on from Rome to Naples—from
Naples to Venice—from Venice to
Vienna—to Dresden, to Berlin, without
one generous connection or pleasurable
anecdote to tell of; but he
had travell'd straight on looking
neither to his right hand or his left,
lest Love or Pity should seduce him
out of his road. 
Peace be to them! if it is to be
found; but heaven itself, was it possible
to get there with such tempers, 

would want objects to give it—every
gentle spirit would come flying upon
the wings of Love to hail their arrival 
—Nothing would the souls of
Smelfungus and Mundungus hear of,
but fresh anthems of joy, fresh raptures
of love, and fresh congratulations
of their common felicity —I
heartily pity them: they have brought
up no faculties for this work; and
was the happiest mansion in heaven
to be allotted to Smelfungus and
Mundungus, they would be so far
from being happy, that the souls of
Smelfungus and Mundungus would
do penance there to all eternity.
