Having, on first sight of the
lady, settled the affair in my
fancy, “that she was of the better
order of beings”—and then laid it
down as a second axiom, as indisputable
as the first, That she was a widow,
and wore a character of distress 
—I went no further; I got ground
enough for the situation which pleased
me—and had she remained close beside
my elbow till midnight, I should
have held true to my system, and
considered her only under that general
idea. 

She had scarce got twenty paces
distant from me, ere something within
me called out for a more particular
inquiry—it brought on the idea of a
further separation —I might possibly
never see her more—the heart is for
saving what it can; and I wanted the
traces thro' which my wishes might
find their way to her, in case I should
never rejoin her myself: in a word,
I wish'd to know her name—her family's
—her condition; and as I knew
the place to which she was going, I
wanted to know from whence she
came: but there was no coming at
all this intelligence: a hundred little
delicacies stood in the way. I form'd
a score different plans —There was 

no such thing as a man's asking her
directly—the thing was impossible. 
A little French debonaire captain,
who came dancing down the street,
shewed me, it was the easiest thing
in the world; for popping in betwixt
us, just as the lady was returning back
to the door of the Remise, he introduced
himself to my acquaintance,
and before he had well got announced,
begg'd I would do him the honour
to present him to the lady —I
had not been presented myself—so
turning about to her, he did it just
as well by asking her, if she had come
from Paris? —No: she was going
that rout, she said. —Vous n'etez pas
de Londre? —She was not, she replied. 

—Then Madame must have come
thro' Flanders. —Apparamment vous
etez Flammande? said the French captain. 
—The lady answered, she was. — 
Peutetre, de Lisle? added he —She
said, she was not of Lisle. —Nor Arras?
—nor Cambray?—nor Ghent?— 
nor Brussels? She answered, she was
of Brussels. 
He had had the honour, he said,
to be at the bombardment of it last
war—that it was finely situated, pour
cela—and full of noblesse when the
Imperialists were driven out by the
French (the lady made a slight curtsy)
—so giving her an account of the affair,
and of the share he had had in 

it—he begg'd the honour to know
her name—so made his bow. 
—Et Madame a son Mari?—said
he, looking back when he had made
two steps—and without staying for an
answer—danced down the street. 
Had I served seven years apprenticeship
to good breeding, I could
not have done as much.
