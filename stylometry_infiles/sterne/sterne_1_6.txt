My heart smote me the moment
he shut the door —Psha! said
I with an air of carelessness, three
several times—but it would not do:
every ungracious syllable I had utter'd,
crouded back into my imagination: 
I reflected, I had no right
over the poor Franciscan, but to deny
him; and that the punishment of
that was enough to the disappointed
without the addition of unkind language 
—I consider'd his grey hairs— 
his courteous figure seem'd to re-enter
and gently ask me what injury
he had done me?—and why I could 

use him thus —I would have given
twenty livres for an advocate —I
have behaved very ill; said I within
myself; but I have only just set out
upon my travels; and shall learn
better manners as I get along.
