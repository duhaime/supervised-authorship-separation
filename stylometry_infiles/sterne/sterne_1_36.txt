The beautiful Grisset rose up
when I said this, and going
behind the counter, reach'd down a
parcel and untied it: I advanced to
the side over-against her: they were
all too large. The beautiful Grisset
measured them one by one across my
hand —It would not alter the dimensions 
—She begg'd I would try a single
pair, which seemed to be the least — 
She held it open—my hand slipp'd
into it at once —It will not do, said I, 

shaking my head a little —No, said
she, doing the same thing. 
There are certain combined looks
of simple subtlety—where whim, and
sense, and seriousness, and nonsense,
are so blended, that all the languages
of Babel set loose together could not
express them—they are communicated
and caught so instantaneously,
that you can scarce say which party
is the infecter. I leave it to your
men of words to swell pages about it
—it is enough in the present to say
again, the gloves would not do; so
folding our hands within our arms,
we both loll'd upon the counter—it
was narrow, and there was just room
for the parcel to lay between us. 

The beautiful Grisset look'd sometimes
at the gloves, then side-ways
to the window, then at the gloves— 
and then at me. I was not disposed
to break silence —I follow'd her example:
so I look'd at the gloves,
then to the window, then at the
gloves, and then at her—and so on
alternately. 
I found I lost considerably in every
attack—she had a quick black eye,
and shot through two such long and
silken eye-lashes with such penetration,
that she look'd into my very
heart and reins —It may seem strange,
but I could actually feel she did— 

—It is no matter, said I, taking
up a couple of the pairs next me,
and putting them into my pocket, 
I was sensible the beautiful Grisset
had not ask'd above a single livre
above the price —I wish'd she had
ask'd a livre more, and was puzzling
my brains how to bring the matter
about —Do you think, my dear Sir,
said she, mistaking my embarrassment,
that I could ask a sous too
much of a stranger—and of a stranger
whose politeness, more than his want
of gloves, has done me the honour
to lay himself at my mercy? —M'en
croyez capable? —Faith! not I, said I; 
and if you were, you are welcome— 

So counting the money into her hand,
and with a lower bow than one generally
makes to a shopkeeper's wife, I
went out, and her lad with his parcel
followed me.
