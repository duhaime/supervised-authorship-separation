From this moment I am to be
considered as heir-apparent to the
Shandy family—and it is from this point
properly, that the story of my Life
and my Opinions sets out; with all
my hurry and precipitation I have but 

been clearing the ground to raise the
building——and such a building do I
foresee it will turn out, as never was
planned, and as never was executed since
Adam. In less than five minutes I shall
have thrown my pen into the fire, and
the little drop of thick ink which is left
remaining at the bottom of my ink-horn,
after it—I have but half a score
things to do in the time——I have a
thing to name—a thing to lament—a
thing to hope—a thing to promise, and
a thing to threaten—I have a thing to
suppose—a thing to declare—a thing
to conceal—a thing to chuse, and a
thing to pray for. —This chapter, therefore,
I name the chapter of Things— 
and my next chapter to it, that is, the
first chapter of my next volume, if I live,
shall be my chapter upon WHISKERS, 

in order to keep up some sort of connection
in my works. 
The thing I lament is, that things
have crowded in so thick upon me,
that I have not been able to get into
that part of my work, towards which,
I have all the way, looked forwards,
with so much earnest desire; and that is
the campaigns, but especially the amours
of my uncle Toby, the events of which
are of so singular a nature, and so Cervantick
a cast, that if I can so manage
it, as to convey but the same impressions
to every other brain, which the occurrences
themselves excite in my own— 
I will answer for it the book shall make
its way in the world, much better
than its master has done before it—— 
Oh Tristram! Tristram! can this but
be once brought about—the credit, 

which will attend thee as an author,
shall counterbalance the many evils which
have befallen thee as a man—thou wilt
feast upon the one—when thou hast
lost all sense and remembrance of the
other!— 
No wonder I itch so much as I do,
to get at these amours—They are the
choicest morsel of my whole story! and
when I do get at 'em—assure yourselves,
good folks,—(nor do I value whose
squeamish stomach takes offence at it)
I shall not be at all nice in the choice of
my words;——and that's the thing I
have to declare. —I shall never get all
through in five minutes, that I fear— 
and the thing I hope is, that your worships
and reverences are not offended— 
if you are, depend upon't I'll give you
something, my good gentry, next year, 

to be offended at——that's my dear
Jenny's way—but who my Jenny is— 
and which is the right and which the
wrong end of a woman, is the thing
to be concealed—it shall be told you
the next chapter but one, to my chapter
of button-holes,—and not one chapter
before. 
And now that you have just got to
the end of these four volumes——the
thing I have to ask is, how you feel
your heads? my own akes dismally— 
as for your healths, I know, they are
much better——True Shandeism, think
what you will against it, opens the
heart and lungs, and like all those affections
which partake of its nature, it
forces the blood and other vital fluids of
the body to run freely thro' its channels, 

and makes the wheel of life run long
and chearfully round. 
Was I left like Sancho Pança, to
chuse my kingdom; it should not be
maritime—or a kingdom of blacks to
make a penny of—no, it should
be a kingdom of hearty laughing subjects: 
And as the bilious and more saturnine
passions, by creating disorders
in the blood and humours, have as bad
an influence, I see, upon the body politick
as body natural—and as nothing but a
habit of virtue can fully govern those
passions, and subject them to reason—I
should add to my prayer—that God
would give my subjects grace to be as
WISE as they were MERRY; and then
should I be the happiest monarch, and
they the happiest people under heaven— 

And so, with this moral for the present,
may it please your worships and
your reverences, I take my leave of you
till this time twelve-month, when (unless
this vile cough kills me in the mean
time) I'll have another pluck at your
beards, and lay open a story to the
world you little dream of.
