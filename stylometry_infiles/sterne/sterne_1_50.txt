There is not a more perplexing
affair in life to me,
than to set about telling any one who
I am—for there is scarce any body I
cannot give a better account of than
of myself; and I have often wish'd I
could do it in a single word—and
have an end of it. It was the only
time and occasion in my life, I could
accomplish this to any purpose—for
Shakespear lying upon the table, and
recollecting I was in his books, I
took up Hamlet, and turning immediately
to the grave-diggers scene in 

the fifth act, I lay'd my finger upon
Yorick, and advancing the book to
the Count, with my finger all the
way over the name—Me, Voici!
said I. 
Now whether the idea of poor
Yorick's skull was put out of the
Count's mind, by the reality of my
own, or by what magic he could
drop a period of seven or eight hundred
years, makes nothing in this
account—'tis certain the French conceive
better than they combine—I
wonder at nothing in this world, and
the less at this; inasmuch as one of
the first of our own church, for whose
candour and paternal sentiments I
have the highest veneration, fell 

into the same mistake in the very
same case. —“He could not bear,” 
he said, “to look into sermons wrote
by the king of Denmark's jester.” 
—Good, my lord! said I—but there
are two Yoricks. The Yorick your
lordship thinks of, has been dead
and buried eight hundred years ago; 
he flourish'd in Horwendillus's court
—the other Yorick is myself, who
have flourish'd, my lord, in no court
—He shook his head—Good God!
said I, you might as well confound
Alexander the Great, with Alexander
the Copper-smith, my lord—'Twas
all one, he replied— 
—If Alexander king of Macedon
could have translated your lordship, 

said I, I'm sure your Lordship
would not have said so. 
The poor Count de B**** fell
but into the same error— 
—Et, Monsieur, est il Yorick?
cried the Count. —Je le suis, said I. 
—Vous?—Moi—moi qui ai l'honneur
de vous parler, Monsieur le Compte— 
Mon Dieu! said he, embracing me
—Vous etes Yorick. 
The Count instantly put the Shakespear
into his pocket, and left me
alone in his room.
