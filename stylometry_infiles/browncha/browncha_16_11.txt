As &longs;oon as evening arrived, I performed my visit.
Carwin made one of the company, into which
I was u&longs;hered. Appearances were the &longs;ame as
when I before beheld him. His garb was equally
negligent and ru&longs;tic. I gazed upon his countenance
with new curio&longs;ity. My &longs;ituation was &longs;uch
as to enable me to be&longs;tow upon it a deliberate examination.
Viewed at more lei&longs;ure, it lo&longs;t none
of its wonderful properties. I could not deny my
homage to the intelligence expre&longs;&longs;ed in it, but was
wholly uncertain, whether he were an object to be
dreaded or adored, and whether his powers had
been exerted to evil or to good.
He was &longs;paring in di&longs;cour&longs;e; but whatever he
&longs;aid was pregnant with meaning, and uttered with
rectitude of articulation, and force of empha&longs;is, of
which I had entertained no conception previou&longs;ly
to my knowledge of him. Notwith&longs;tanding the
uncouthne&longs;s of his garb, his manners were not unpolished.
All topics were handled by him with
&longs;kill, and without pedantry or affectation. He
uttered no &longs;entiment calculated to produce a disadvantageous
impre&longs;&longs;ion: on the contrary, his observations
denoted a mind alive to every generous and
heroic feeling. They were introduced without parade,
and accompanied with that degree of earnestness
which indicates &longs;incerity.
He parted from us not till late, refu&longs;ing an invitation
to &longs;pend the night here, but readily con&longs;ented
to repeat his vi&longs;it. His vi&longs;its were frequently repeated.
Each day introduced us to a more intimate





acquaintance with his &longs;entiments, but left us wholly
in the dark, concerning that about which we were
mo&longs;t inqui&longs;itive. He &longs;tudiou&longs;ly avoided all mention
of his pa&longs;t or pre&longs;ent &longs;ituation. Even the place
of his abode in the city he concealed from us.
Our &longs;phere, in this re&longs;pect, being &longs;omewhat
limited, and the intellectual endowments of this man
being indi&longs;putably great, his deportment was more
diligently marked, and copiou&longs;ly commented on by
us, than you, perhaps, will think the circum&longs;tances
warranted. Not a ge&longs;ture, or glance, or accent,
that was not, in our private a&longs;&longs;emblies, di&longs;cu&longs;&longs;ed,
and inferences deduced from it. It may well be
thought that he modelled his behaviour by an uncommon
&longs;tandard, when, with all our opportunities
and accuracy of ob&longs;ervation, we were able,
for a long time, to gather no &longs;atisfactory information.
He afforded us no ground on which to
build even a plau&longs;ible conjecture.
There is a degree of familiarity which takes
place between con&longs;tant a&longs;&longs;ociates, that ju&longs;tifies the
negligence of many rules of which, in an earlier
period of their intercour&longs;e, politene&longs;s requires the
exact ob&longs;ervance. Inquiries into our condition are
allowable when they are prompted by a di&longs;intere&longs;ted
concern for our welfare; and this &longs;olicitude is not
only pardonable, but may ju&longs;tly be demanded from
tho&longs;e who chu&longs;e us for their companions. This
&longs;tate of things was more &longs;low to arrive on this occasion
than on mo&longs;t others, on account of the gravity
and loftine&longs;s of this man's behaviour.
Pleyel, however, began, at length, to employ regular
means for this end. He occa&longs;ionally alluded
to the circum&longs;tances in which they had formerly
met, and remarked the incongruou&longs;ne&longs;s between the
religion and habits of a Spaniard, with tho&longs;e of a




native of Britain. He expre&longs;&longs;ed his a&longs;toni&longs;hment
at meeting our gue&longs;t in this corner of the globe,
e&longs;pecially as, when they parted in Spain, he was
taught to believe that Carwin &longs;hould never leave
that country. He in&longs;inuated, that a change &longs;o
great mu&longs;t have been prompted by motives of a
&longs;ingular and momentous kind.
No an&longs;wer, or an an&longs;wer wide of the purpo&longs;e;
was generally made to the&longs;e in&longs;inuations. Britons
and Spaniards, he &longs;aid, are votaries of the &longs;ame
Deity, and &longs;quare their faith by the &longs;ame precepts;
their ideas are drawn from the &longs;ame fountains of
literature, and they &longs;peak dialects of the &longs;ame
tongue; their government and laws have more resemblances
than differences; they were formerly
provinces of the &longs;ame civil, and till lately, of the
&longs;ame religious, Empire.
As to the motives which induce men to change
the place of their abode, the&longs;e mu&longs;t unavoidably
be fleeting and mutable. If not bound to one &longs;pot
by conjugal or parental ties, or by the nature of
that employment to which we are indebted for
&longs;ub&longs;i&longs;tence, the inducements to change are far
more numerous and powerful, than oppo&longs;ite inducements.

He &longs;poke as if de&longs;irous of &longs;hewing that he was
not aware of the tendency of Pleyel's remarks;
yet, certain tokens were apparent, that proved him
by no means wanting in penetration. The&longs;e tokens
were to be read in his countenance, and not in his
words. When any thing was &longs;aid, indicating curiosity
in us, the gloom of his countenance was
deepened, his eyes &longs;unk to the ground, and his
wonted air was not re&longs;umed without vi&longs;ible struggle.
Hence, it was obvious to infer, that &longs;ome incidents
of his life were reflected on by him with




regret; and that, &longs;ince the&longs;e incidents were carefully
concealed, and even that regret which flowed from
them laboriou&longs;ly &longs;tifled, they had not been merely
di&longs;a&longs;trous. The &longs;ecrecy that was ob&longs;erved appeared
not de&longs;igned to provoke or baffle the inquisitive,
but was prompted by the &longs;hame, or by the
prudence of guilt.
The&longs;e ideas, which were adopted by Pleyel and
my brother, as well as my&longs;elf, hindered us from
employing more direct means for accompli&longs;hing
our wi&longs;hes. Que&longs;tions might have been put in
&longs;uch terms, that no room &longs;hould be left for the pretence
of mi&longs;apprehen&longs;ion, and if mode&longs;ty merely
had been the ob&longs;tacle, &longs;uch que&longs;tions would not
have been wanting; but we con&longs;idered, that, if the
di&longs;clo&longs;ure were productive of pain or di&longs;grace, it
was inhuman to extort it.
Amid&longs;t the various topics that were di&longs;cu&longs;&longs;ed in
his pre&longs;ence, allu&longs;ions were, of cour&longs;e, made to the
inexplicable events that had lately happened. At
tho&longs;e times, the words and looks of this man were
objects of my particular attention. The &longs;ubject
was extraordinary; and any one who&longs;e experience
or reflections could throw any light upon it, was
entitled to my gratitude. As this man was enlightened
by reading and travel, I li&longs;tened with
eagerne&longs;s to the remarks which he &longs;hould make.
At fir&longs;t, I entertained a kind of apprehen&longs;ion,
that the tale would be heard by him with incredulity
and &longs;ecret ridicule. I had formerly heard
&longs;tories that re&longs;embled this in &longs;ome of their mysterious
circum&longs;tances, but they were, commonly,
heard by me with contempt. I was doubtful, whether
the &longs;ame impre&longs;&longs;ion would not now be made
on the mind of our gue&longs;t; but I was mi&longs;taken in
my fears.






He heard them with &longs;eriou&longs;ne&longs;s, and without any
marks either of &longs;urprize or incredulity. He pur&longs;ued,
with vi&longs;ible plea&longs;ure, that kind of di&longs;qui&longs;ition which
was naturally &longs;ugge&longs;ted by them. His fancy was
eminently vigorous and prolific, and if he did not
per&longs;uade us, that human beings are, &longs;ometimes, admitted
to a &longs;en&longs;ible intercour&longs;e with the author of
nature, he, at lea&longs;t, won over our inclination to the
cau&longs;e. He merely deduced, from his own reasonings,
that &longs;uch intercour&longs;e was probable; but confessed
that, though he was acquainted with many
in&longs;tances &longs;omewhat &longs;imilar to tho&longs;e which had been
related by us, none of them were perfectly exempted
from the &longs;u&longs;picion of human agency.
On being reque&longs;ted to relate the&longs;e in&longs;tances, he
amu&longs;ed us with many curious details. His narratives
were con&longs;tructed with &longs;o much &longs;kill, and rehearsed
with &longs;o much energy, that all the effects
of a dramatic exhibition were frequently produced
by them. Tho&longs;e that were mo&longs;t coherent and mo&longs;t
minute, and, of con&longs;equence, lea&longs;t entitled to credit,
were yet rendered probable by the exqui&longs;ite art of
this rhetorician. For every difficulty that was
&longs;ugge&longs;ted, a ready and plau&longs;ible &longs;olution was furnished.
My&longs;terious voices had always a &longs;hare in
producing the cata&longs;trophe, but they were always
to be explained on &longs;ome known principles, either
as reflected into a focus, or communicated through
a tube. I could not but remark that his narratives,
however complex or marvellous, contained no instance
&longs;ufficiently parallel to tho&longs;e that had befallen
our&longs;elves, and in which the &longs;olution was applicable
to our own case.
My brother was a much more &longs;anguine rea&longs;oner
than our gue&longs;t. Even in &longs;ome of the facts which
were related by Carwin, he maintained the





probability of cele&longs;tial interference, when the latter was
di&longs;po&longs;ed to deny it, and had found, as he imagined,
foot&longs;teps of an human agent. Pleyel was by no
means equally credulous. He &longs;crupled not to deny
faith to any te&longs;timony but that of his &longs;en&longs;es, and
allowed the facts which had lately been &longs;upported by
this te&longs;timony, not to mould his belief, but merely
to give birth to doubts.
It was &longs;oon ob&longs;erved that Carwin adopted, in
&longs;ome degree, a &longs;imilar di&longs;tinction. A tale of this
kind, related by others, he would believe, provided
it was explicable upon known principles; but that
&longs;uch notices were actually communicated by beings
of an higher order, he would believe only when his
own ears were a&longs;&longs;ailed in a manner which could not
be otherwi&longs;e accounted for. Civility forbad him
to contradict my brother or my&longs;elf, but his understanding
refu&longs;ed to acquie&longs;ce in our te&longs;timony. Besides,
he was di&longs;po&longs;ed to que&longs;tion whether the voices
heard in the temple, at the foot of the hill, and in
my clo&longs;et, were not really uttered by human organs.
On this &longs;upposition he was de&longs;ired to explain
how the effect was produced.
He an&longs;wered, that the power of mimickry was
very common. Catharine's voice might ea&longs;ily be
imitated by one at the foot of the hill, who would
find no difficulty in eluding, by flight, the &longs;earch
of Wieland. The tidings of the death of the Saxon
lady were uttered by one near at hand, who overheard
the conver&longs;ation, who conjectured her death,
and who&longs;e conjecture happened to accord with the
truth. That the voice appeared to come from the
cieling was to be con&longs;idered as an illu&longs;ion of the
fancy. The cry for help, heard in the hall on the
night of my adventure, was to be a&longs;cribed to an
human creature, who actually &longs;tood in the hall




when he uttered it. It was of no moment, he &longs;aid,
that we could not explain by what motives he that
made the &longs;ignal was led hither. How imperfectly
acquainted were we with the condition and de&longs;igns
of the beings that &longs;urrounded us? The city was
near at hand, and thou&longs;ands might there exi&longs;t
who&longs;e powers and purpo&longs;es might ea&longs;ily explain
whatever was my&longs;terious in this tran&longs;action. As
to the clo&longs;et dialogue, he was obliged to adopt one
of two &longs;uppo&longs;itions, and affirm either that it was
fa&longs;hioned in my own fancy, or that it actually took
place between two per&longs;ons in the clo&longs;et.
Such was Carwin's mode of explaining the&longs;e
appearances. It is &longs;uch, perhaps, as would commend
it&longs;elf as mo&longs;t plau&longs;ible to the mo&longs;t &longs;agacious
minds, but it was in&longs;ufficient to impart conviction
to us. As to the trea&longs;on that was meditated again&longs;t
me, it was doubtle&longs;s ju&longs;t to conclude that it was
either real or imaginary; but that it was real was
atte&longs;ted by the my&longs;terious warning in the summer-house,
the &longs;ecret of which I had hitherto locked up
in my own brea&longs;t.
A month pa&longs;&longs;ed away in this kind of intercour&longs;e.
As to Carwin, our ignorance was in no degree
enlightened re&longs;pecting his genuine character and
views. Appearances were uniform. No man
po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;ed a larger &longs;tore of knowledge, or a greater
degree of &longs;kill in the communication of it to others;
Hence he was regarded as an ine&longs;timable addition
to our &longs;ociety. Con&longs;idering the di&longs;tance of my
brother's hou&longs;e from the city, he was frequently
prevailed upon to pa&longs;s the night where he &longs;pent the
evening. Two days &longs;eldom elap&longs;ed without a vi&longs;it
from him; hence he was regarded as a kind of inmate
of the hou&longs;e. He entered and departed without
ceremony. When he arrived he received an




unaffected welcome, and when he cho&longs;e to retire,
no importunities were u&longs;ed to induce him to remain.

The temple was the principal &longs;cene of our &longs;ocial
enjoyments; yet the felicity that we ta&longs;ted when assembled
in this a&longs;ylum, was but the gleam of a
former &longs;un-&longs;hine. Carwin never parted with his
gravity. The in&longs;crutablene&longs;s of his character, and
the uncertainty whether his fellow&longs;hip tended to
good or to evil, were &longs;eldom ab&longs;ent from our
minds. This circum&longs;tance powerfully contributed
to &longs;adden us.
My heart was the &longs;eat of growing di&longs;quietudes.
This change in one who had formerly been characterized
by all the exuberances of &longs;oul, could not
fail to be remarked by my friends. My brother was
always a pattern of &longs;olemnity. My &longs;i&longs;ter was clay,
moulded by the circum&longs;tances in which &longs;he happened
to be placed. There was but one who&longs;e deportment
remains to be de&longs;cribed as being of importance
to our happine&longs;s. Had Pleyel likewi&longs;e
di&longs;mi&longs;&longs;ed his vivacity?
He was as whim&longs;ical and je&longs;tful as ever, but he
was not happy. The truth, in this re&longs;pect, was
of too much importance to me not to make me a
vigilant ob&longs;erver. His mirth was ea&longs;ily perceived
to be the fruit of exertion. When his thoughts
wandered from the company, an air of dissatisfaction
and impatience &longs;tole acro&longs;s his features. Even
the punctuality and frequency of his vi&longs;its were
&longs;omewhat le&longs;&longs;ened. It may be &longs;uppo&longs;ed that my
own unea&longs;ine&longs;s was heightened by the&longs;e tokens;
but, &longs;trange as it may &longs;eem, I found, in the pre&longs;ent
&longs;tate of my mind, no relief but in the per&longs;ua&longs;ion
that Pleyel was unhappy.






That unhappine&longs;s, indeed, depended, for its value
in my eyes, on the cau&longs;e that produced it. It did
not ari&longs;e from the death of the Saxon lady: it was
not a contagious emanation from the countenances
of Wieland or Carwin. There was but one other
&longs;ource whence it could flow. A namele&longs;s ec&longs;tacy
thrilled through my frame when any new proof
occurred that the ambiguou&longs;ne&longs;s of my behaviour
was the cau&longs;e.
