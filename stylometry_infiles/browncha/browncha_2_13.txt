TO MRS. HOWARD.
Philadelphia, April 14.






I HAVE been here thirty hours, and have
not written to you. I know your impatience,
and that of your girl; but, till this hour I was
unable to give you information that would relieve
your fears. Edgar was, indeed, ill. I
found him in a state wholly desperate. He had
not strength to lift his eye-lids at my approach,
or to articulate a welcome.
I found in his chamber his nurse and his
physician. The former is a young lady, newly
married, who resides in this neighbourhood,
and a sister of the person whom our pupil
saved from drowning. She has paid him the
kindest and most anxious attention.






Let me hasten to tell you that the crisis
has passed, and terminated favourably. A profound
sleep of ten hours, has left him free from
pain and fever, though in a state of weakness
which could not be carried beyond its present
degree, without death.
Set your hearts at rest. The lad is safe. I
promised to bring him back alive and well, and
will certainly fulfil my promise; but some
weeks must elapse before he will be fit for the
journey. You must wait with patience till
then. Farewel.

E. Howard.
