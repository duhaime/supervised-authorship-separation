To Mrs. Montford.
Philadelphia, Oct. 7.
Madam,






It is with extreme reluctance that I venture
to address you in this manner. I cannot find
words to account for or apologise. But if you
be, indeed, the sister of Henry Colden, you cannot
be ignorant of me, and of former transactions
between us; and especially, the circumstance
that now compels me to writeâ€”you can
be no stranger to his present situation.
Can you forgive this boldness? in an absolute
stranger to your person, but not to your
virtues. I have heard much of you, from one
in whom I once had some little interest; Who
honored me with his affection.
I know that you lately possessed a large share
of that affection. I doubt not that you still retain
it, and are able to tell me what has become
of him.
I have, a long time, struggled with myself
and my fears in silence. I know how unbecoming
this address must appear to you, and yet,
persuaded that my character and my relation




to your brother are well known to you, I have
been able to curb my anxieties no longer.
Do then, my dearest madam, gratify my curiosity,
and tell me without delay, what has become
of your brother.

J. Talbot.
