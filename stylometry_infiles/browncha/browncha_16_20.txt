I had no inclination nor power to move from
this &longs;pot. For more than an hour, my faculties
and limbs &longs;eemed to be deprived of all activity.
The door below creaked on its hinges, and &longs;teps
a&longs;cended the &longs;tairs. My wandering and confu&longs;ed
thoughts were in&longs;tantly recalled by the&longs;e sounds,
and dropping the curtain of the bed, I moved to a
part of the room where any one who entered
&longs;hould be vi&longs;ible; &longs;uch are the vibrations of sentiment,
that notwith&longs;tanding the &longs;eeming fulfilment
of my fears, and increa&longs;e of my danger, I
was con&longs;cious, on this occa&longs;ion, to no turbulence
but that of curio&longs;ity.
At length he entered the apartment, and I recognized
my brother. It was the &longs;ame Wieland
whom I had ever &longs;een. Yet his features were
pervaded by a new expre&longs;&longs;ion. I &longs;uppo&longs;ed him
unacquainted with the fate of his wife, and his appearance
confirmed this per&longs;ua&longs;ion. A brow expanding
into exultation I had hitherto never &longs;een
in him, yet &longs;uch a brow did he now wear. Not
only was he unapprized of the di&longs;a&longs;ter that had happened,
but &longs;ome joyous occurrence had betided.
What a rever&longs;e was preparing to annihilate his transitory
bli&longs;s! No hu&longs;band ever doated more fondly,
for no wife ever claimed &longs;o boundle&longs;s a devotion. I
was not uncertain as to the effects to flow from the
di&longs;covery of her fate. I confided not at all in the
efforts of his rea&longs;on or his piety. There were few




evils which his modes of thinking would not di&longs;arm
of their &longs;ting; but here, all opiates to grief, and all
compellers of patience were vain. This &longs;pectacle
would be unavoidably followed by the outrages of
de&longs;peration, and a ru&longs;hing to death.
For the pre&longs;ent, I neglected to a&longs;k my&longs;elf what
motive brought him hither. I was only fearful of
the effects to flow from the sight of the dead. Yet
could it be long concealed from him? Some time
and &longs;peedily he would obtain this knowledge. No
&longs;tratagems could con&longs;iderably or u&longs;efully prolong
his ignorance. All that could be &longs;ought was to
take away the abruptne&longs;s of the change, and &longs;hut
out the confu&longs;ion of'de&longs;pair, and the inroads of
madne&longs;s: but I knew my brother, and knew that
all exertions to con&longs;ole him would be fruitle&longs;s.
What could I &longs;ay? I was mute, and poured
forth tho&longs;e tears on his account, which my own
unhappine&longs;s had been unable to extort. In the
mid&longs;t of my tears, I was not unob&longs;ervant of his
motions. The&longs;e were of a nature to rou&longs;e &longs;ome
other &longs;entiment than grief, or, at lea&longs;t, to mix with
it a portion of a&longs;toni&longs;hment.
His countenance &longs;uddenly became troubled. His
hands were cla&longs;ped with a force that left the print
of his nails in his fle&longs;h. His eyes were fixed on
my feet. His brain &longs;eemed to &longs;well beyond its continent.
He did not cea&longs;e to breathe, but his breath
was &longs;tifled into groans. I had never witne&longs;&longs;ed the
hurricane of human pa&longs;&longs;ions. My element had,
till lately, been all &longs;un&longs;hine and calm. I was unconversant
with the altitudes and energies of sentiment,
and was transfixed with inexplicable horror
by the &longs;ymptoms which I now beheld.
After a &longs;ilence and a conflict which I could not
interpret, be lifted his eyes to heaven, and in broken




accents exclaimed, “This is too much! Any victim
but this, and thy will be done. Have I not sufficiently
atte&longs;ted my faith and my obedience? She
that is gone, they that have peri&longs;hed, were linked
with my &longs;oul by ties which only thy command
would have broken; but here is &longs;anctity and excellence
&longs;urpa&longs;&longs;ing human. This workman&longs;hip
is thine, and it cannot be thy will to heap it into
ruins.”
Here &longs;uddenly uncla&longs;ping his hands, he &longs;truck
one of them again&longs;t his forehead, and continued—
“Wretch! who made thee quick &longs;ighted in the
councils of thy Maker? Deliverance from mortal
setters is awarded to this being, and thou art the
mini&longs;ter of this decree.”
So &longs;aying, Wieland advanced towards me. His
words and his motions were without meaning, except
on one &longs;uppo&longs;ition. The death of Catharine
was already known to him, and that knowledge, as
might have been &longs;u&longs;pected, had de&longs;troyed his rea&longs;on.
I had feared nothing le&longs;s; but now that I beheld
the extinction of a mind the mo&longs;t luminous and
penetrating that ever dignified the human form, my
&longs;en&longs;ations were fraught with new and in&longs;upportable
angui&longs;h.
I had not time to reflect in what way my own
&longs;afety would be effected by this revolution, or what
I had to dread from the wild conceptions of a madman.
He advanced towards me. Some hollow
noi&longs;es were wa&longs;ted by the breeze. Confu&longs;ed clamours
were &longs;ucceeded by many feet traver&longs;ing the
gra&longs;s, and then crowding into the piazza.
The&longs;e &longs;ounds &longs;u&longs;pended my brother's purpo&longs;e,
and he &longs;tood to li&longs;ten. The &longs;ignals multiplied and
grew louder; perceiving this, he turned from me,
and hurried out of my &longs;ight. All about me was




pregnant with motives to a&longs;toni&longs;hment. My sister's
corp&longs;e, Wieland's frantic demeanour, and, at
length, this crowd of vi&longs;itants &longs;o little accorded with
my fore&longs;ight, that my mental progre&longs;s was &longs;topped.
The impul&longs;e had cea&longs;ed which was accu&longs;tomed to
give motion and order to my thoughts.
Foot&longs;teps thronged upon the &longs;tairs, and pre&longs;ently
many faces &longs;hewed them&longs;elves within the door of
my apartment. The&longs;e looks were full of alarm
and watchfulne&longs;s. They pryed into corners as if
in &longs;earch of &longs;ome fugitive; next their gaze was
fixed upon me, and betokened all the vehemence of
terror and pity. For a time I que&longs;tioned whether
the&longs;e were not &longs;hapes and faces like that which I
had &longs;een at the bottom of the &longs;tairs, creatures of my
fancy or airy exi&longs;tences.
My eye wandered from one to another, till at
length it fell on a countenance which I well knew.
It was that of Mr. Hallet. This man was a distant
kin&longs;man of my mother, venerable for his age,
his uprightne&longs;s, and &longs;agacity. He had long discharged
the functions of a magi&longs;trate and good citizen.
If any terrors remained, his pre&longs;ence was
&longs;ufficient to di&longs;pel them.
He approached, took my hand with a compassionate
air, and &longs;aid in a low voice. “Where, my dear
Clara, are your brother and &longs;i&longs;ter?” I made no
an&longs;wer, but pointed to the bed. His attendants drew
a&longs;ide the curtain, and while their eyes glared with
horror at the &longs;pectacle which they beheld, tho&longs;e of
Mr. Hallet overflowed with tears.
After con&longs;iderable pau&longs;e, he once more turned
to me. “My dear girl, this &longs;ight is not for you.
Can you confide in my care, and that of Mrs.
Baynton's? We will &longs;ee performed all that circumstances
require.”






I made &longs;trenuous oppo&longs;ition to this reque&longs;t. I
in&longs;i&longs;ted on remaining near her till &longs;he were interred.
His remon&longs;trances, however, and my own feelings,
&longs;hewed me the propriety of a temporary dereliction.
Loui&longs;a &longs;tood in need of a comforter, and my brother's
children of a nur&longs;e. My unhappy brother
was him&longs;elf an object of &longs;olicitude and care. At
length, I con&longs;ented to relinqui&longs;h the corp&longs;e, and go
to my brother's, who&longs;e hou&longs;e, I &longs;aid, would need
mi&longs;tre&longs;s, and his children a parent.
During this di&longs;cour&longs;e, my venerable friend struggled
with his tears, but my la&longs;t intimation called
them forth with fre&longs;h violence. Meanwhile, his
attendants &longs;tood round in mournful &longs;ilence, gazing
on me and at each other. I repeated my resolution,
and ro&longs;e to execute it; but he took my hand
to detain me. His countenance betrayed irresolution
and reluctance. I reque&longs;ted him to &longs;tate the
rea&longs;on of his oppo&longs;ition to this mea&longs;ure. I entreated
him to be explicit. I told him that my brother
had ju&longs;t been there, and that I knew his condition.
This misfortune had driven him to madne&longs;s, and
his offspring mu&longs;t not want a protector. If he
cho&longs;e, I would re&longs;ign Wieland to his care; but his
innocent and helple&longs;s babes &longs;tood in in&longs;tant need of
nur&longs;e and mother, and the&longs;e offices I would by no
means allow another to perform while I had life.
Every word that I uttered &longs;eemed to augment his
perplexity and di&longs;tre&longs;s. At la&longs;t he &longs;aid, “I think,
Clara, I have entitled my&longs;elf to &longs;ome regard from
you. You have profe&longs;&longs;ed your willingne&longs;s to oblige
me. Now I call upon you to confer upon me
the highe&longs;t obligation in your power. Permit Mrs.
Baynton to have the management of your brother's
hou&longs;e for two or three days; then it &longs;hall be yours
to act in it as you plea&longs;e. No matter what are my




motives in making this reque&longs;t: perhaps I think
your age, your &longs;ex, or the di&longs;tre&longs;s which this disaster
mu&longs;t occa&longs;ion, incapacitates you for the office.
Surely you have no doubt of Mrs. Baynton's tenderness
or di&longs;cretion.”
New ideas now ru&longs;hed into my mind. I fixed
my eyes &longs;tedfa&longs;tly on Mr. Hallet. “Are they
well?” &longs;aid I. “Is Loui&longs;a well? Are Benjamin,
and William, and Con&longs;tantine, and Little Clara,
are they &longs;afe? Tell me truly, I be&longs;eech you!”
“They are well,” he replied; “they are perfectly
&longs;afe.”
“Fear no effeminate weekne&longs;s in me: I can bear
to hear the truth. Tell me truly, are they well?”
He again a&longs;&longs;ured me that they were well.
“What then,” re&longs;umed I, “do you fear? Is
it po&longs;&longs;ible for any calamity to di&longs;qualify me for performing
my duty to the&longs;e helple&longs;s innocents? I am
willing to divide the care of them with Mrs. Baynton;
I &longs;hall be grateful for her &longs;ympathy and aid;
but what &longs;hould I be to de&longs;ert them at an hour like
this!”
I will cut &longs;hort this di&longs;tre&longs;sful dialogue. I &longs;till
per&longs;i&longs;ted in my purpo&longs;e, and he &longs;till per&longs;i&longs;ted in his
oppo&longs;ition. This excited my &longs;u&longs;picions anew; but
the&longs;e were removed by &longs;olemn declarations of their
&longs;afety. I could not explain this conduct in my
friend; but at length con&longs;ented to go to the city,
provided I &longs;hould &longs;ee them for a few minutes at
pre&longs;ent, and &longs;hould return on the morrow.
Even this arrangement was objected to. At
length he told me they were removed to the city.
Why were they removed, I a&longs;ked, and whither?
My importunities would not now be eluded. My
&longs;u&longs;picions were rou&longs;ed, and no eva&longs;ion or artifice
was &longs;ufficient to allay them. Many of the




audience began to give vent to their emotions in tears.
Mr. Hallet him&longs;elf &longs;eemed as if the conflict were
too hard to be longer &longs;u&longs;tained. Something whispered
to my heart that havoc had been wider than
I now witne&longs;&longs;ed. I &longs;u&longs;pected this concealment to
ari&longs;e from apprehen&longs;ions of the effects which a
knowledge of the truth would produce in me. I
once more entreated him to inform me truly of
their &longs;tate. To enforce my entreaties, I put on an
air of in&longs;en&longs;ibility. “I can gue&longs;s,” &longs;aid I, “what
has happened—They are indeed beyond the reach
of injury, for they are dead! Is it not &longs;o?” My
voice faltered in &longs;pite of my courageous efforts.
“Yes,” &longs;aid he, “they are dead! Dead by the
&longs;ame fate, and by the &longs;ame hand, with their mother!”
“Dead!” replied I; “what, all?”
“All!” replied he: “he &longs;pared not one!”
Allow me, my friends, to clo&longs;e my eyes upon
the after-&longs;cene. Why &longs;hould I protract a tale which
I already begin to feel is too long? Over this &longs;cene
at lea&longs;t let me pa&longs;s lightly. Here, indeed, my narrative
would be imperfect. All was tempe&longs;tuous
commotion in my heart and in my brain. I have
no memory for ought but uncon&longs;cious tran&longs;itions
and rueful &longs;ights. I was ingenious and indefatigable
in the invention of torments. I would not dispense
with any &longs;pectacle adapted to exa&longs;perate my
grief. Each pale and mangled form I cru&longs;hed to
my bo&longs;om. Loui&longs;a, whom I loved with &longs;o ineffable
a pa&longs;&longs;ion, was denied to me at fir&longs;t, but my obstinacy
conquered their reluctance.
They led the way into a darkened hall. A lamp
pendant from the ceiling was uncovered, and they
pointed to a table. The a&longs;&longs;a&longs;&longs;in had defrauded me
of my la&longs;t and mi&longs;erable con&longs;olation. I &longs;ought not




not in her vi&longs;age, for the tinge of the morning, and
the lu&longs;tre of heaven. The&longs;e had vani&longs;hed with
life; but I hoped for liberty to print a la&longs;t ki&longs;s upon
her lips. This was denied me; for &longs;uch had been
the mercile&longs;s blow that de&longs;troyed her, that not a
lineament remained!
I was carried hence to the city. Mrs. Hallet was
my companion and my nur&longs;e. Why &longs;hould I dwell
upon the rage of fever, and the effu&longs;ions of delirium?
Carwin was the phantom that pur&longs;ued my
dreams, the giant oppre&longs;&longs;or under who&longs;e arm I was
for ever on the point of being cru&longs;hed. Strenuous
mu&longs;cles were required to hinder my flight, and
hearts of &longs;teel to with &longs;tand the eloquence of my
fears. In vain I called upon them to look upward,
to mark his &longs;parkling rage and &longs;cowling contempt.
All I &longs;ought was to fly from the &longs;troke that was lifted.
Then I heaped upon my guards the mo&longs;t vehement
reproaches, or betook my&longs;elf to wailings on
the haple&longs;&longs;ne&longs;s of my condition.
This malady, at length, declined, and my weeping
friends began to look for my re&longs;toration. Slowly,
and with intermitted beams, memory revi&longs;ited
me. The &longs;cenes that I had witne&longs;&longs;ed were revived,
became the theme of deliberation and deduction,
and called forth the effu&longs;ions of more rational sorrow.
