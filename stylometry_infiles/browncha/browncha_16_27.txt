“Deeply did I ruminate on the occurrences
that had ju&longs;t pa&longs;&longs;ed. Nothing excited my wonder
&longs;o much as the means by which you di&longs;covered my
being in the clo&longs;et. This di&longs;covery appeared to be
made at the moment when you attempted to open
it. How could you have otherwi&longs;e remained &longs;o
long in the chamber apparently fearle&longs;s and tranquil?
And yet, having made this di&longs;covery, how
could you per&longs;i&longs;t in dragging me forth: per&longs;i&longs;t in
defiance of an interdiction to emphatical and solemn?

“But your &longs;i&longs;ter's death was an event dete&longs;table
and ominous. She had been the victim of the mo&longs;t
dreadful &longs;pecies of a&longs;&longs;a&longs;&longs;ination. How, in a &longs;tate
like yours, the murderous intention could be generated,
was wholly inconceivable.
“I did not relinqui&longs;h my de&longs;ign of confe&longs;&longs;ing to
you the part which I had &longs;u&longs;tained in your family,
but I was willing to defer it till the ta&longs;k which I
had &longs;et my&longs;elf was fini&longs;hed. That being done, I
re&longs;umed the re&longs;olution. The motives to incite me
to this continually acquired force. The more I revolved
the events happening at Mettingen, the more
in&longs;upportable and ominous my terrors became. My
waking hours and my &longs;leep were vexed by di&longs;mal
pre&longs;ages and frightful intimations.
“Catharine was dead by violence. Surely my
malignant &longs;tars had nor made me the cau&longs;e of her
death; yet had I not ra&longs;hly &longs;et in motion a machine,




ever who&longs;e progre&longs;s I had no controul, and which
experience had &longs;hewn me was infinite in power?
Every day might add to the catalogue of horrors of
which this was the &longs;ource, and a &longs;ea&longs;onable disclosure
of the truth might prevent numberle&longs;s ills.
“Fraught with this conception, I have turned
my &longs;teps hither. I find your brother's hou&longs;e desolate:
the furniture removed, and the walls &longs;tained
with damps. Your own is in the &longs;ame &longs;ituation.
Your chamber is di&longs;mantled and dark, and you
exhibit an image of incurable grief, and of rapid
decay.
“I have uttered the truth. This is the extent
of my offences. You tell me an horrid tale of
Wieland being led to the de&longs;truction of his wife and
children, by &longs;ome my&longs;terious agent. You charge
me with the guilt of this agency; but I repeat that
the amount of my guilt has been truly &longs;tated. The
perpetrator of Catharine's death was unknown to
me till now; nay, it is &longs;till unknown to me.”
At that moment, the clo&longs;ing of a door in the
kitchen was di&longs;tinctly heard by us. Carwin &longs;tarted
and pau&longs;ed. “There is &longs;ome one coming. I mu&longs;t
not be found here by my enemies, and need not,
&longs;ince my purpo&longs;e is an&longs;wered.”
I had drunk in, with the mo&longs;t vehement attention,
every word that he had uttered. I had no breath
to interrupt his tale by interrogations or comments.
The power that he &longs;poke of was hitherto unknown
to me: its exi&longs;tence was incredible; it was susceptible
of no direct proof.
He owns that his were the voice and face which
I heard and &longs;aw. He attempts to give an human
explanation of the&longs;e phanta&longs;ms; but it is enough
that he owns him&longs;elf to be the agent; his tale is
a lie, and his nature devili&longs;h. As he deceived me,




he likewi&longs;e deceived my brother, and now do I behold
the author of all our calamities!
Such were my thoughts when his pau&longs;e allowed
me to think. I &longs;hould have bad him begone if the
&longs;ilence had not been interrupted; but now I feared
no more for my&longs;elf; and the milkine&longs;s of my nature
was curdled into hatred and rancour. Some one
was near, and this enemy of God and man might
po&longs;&longs;ibly be brought to ju&longs;tice. I reflected not that
the preternatural power which he had hitherto exerted,
would avail to re&longs;cue him from any toils in
which his feet might be entangled. Meanwhile,
looks, and not words of menace and abhorrence,
were all that I could be&longs;tow.
He did not depart. He &longs;eemed dubious, whether,
by pa&longs;&longs;ing out of the hou&longs;e, or by remaining somewhat
longer where he was, he &longs;hould mo&longs;t endanger
his &longs;afety. His confu&longs;ion increa&longs;ed when &longs;teps
of one barefoot were heard upon the &longs;tairs. He
threw anxious glances &longs;ometimes at the clo&longs;et, sometimes
at the window, and &longs;ometimes at the chamber
door, yet he was detained by &longs;ome inexplicable fascination.
He &longs;tood as if rooted to the &longs;pot.
As to me, my &longs;oul was bur&longs;ting with dete&longs;tation
and revenge. I had no room for &longs;urmi&longs;es and fears
re&longs;pecting him that approached. It was doubtle&longs;s
a human being, and would befriend me &longs;o far as to
aid me in arre&longs;ting this offender.
The &longs;tranger quickly entered the room. My
eyes and the eyes of Carwin were, at the &longs;ame moment,
darted upon him. A &longs;econd glance was not
needed to inform us who he was. His locks were
tangled, and &longs;ell confu&longs;edly over his forehead
and ears. His &longs;hirt was of coar&longs;e &longs;tuff, and open
at the neck and brea&longs;t. His coat was once of
bright and fine texture, but now torn and tarni&longs;ed





with du&longs;t. His feet, his legs, and his arms were
bare. His features were the &longs;eat of a wild and
tranquil &longs;olemnity, but his eyes be&longs;poke inquietude
and curio&longs;ity.
He advanced with firm &longs;tep, and looking as in
&longs;earch of &longs;ome one. He &longs;aw me and &longs;topped. He
bent his &longs;ight on the floor, and clenching his hands,
appeared &longs;uddenly ab&longs;orbed in meditation. Such
were the figure and deportment of Wieland! Such,
in his fallen &longs;tate, were the a&longs;pect and gui&longs;e of my
brother!
Carwin did not fail to recognize the vi&longs;itant.
Care for his own &longs;afety was apparently &longs;wallowed
up in the amazement which this &longs;pectacle produced.
His &longs;tation was con&longs;picuous, and he could
not have e&longs;caped the roving glances of Wieland;
yet the latter &longs;eemed totally uncon&longs;cious of his presence.

Grief at this &longs;cene of ruin and bla&longs;t was at fir&longs;t
the only &longs;entiment of which I was con&longs;cious. A
fearful &longs;tillne&longs;s en&longs;ued. At length Wieland, lifting
his hands, which were locked in each other, to his
brea&longs;t, exclaimed, “Father! I thank thee. This
is thy guidance. Hither thou ha&longs;t led me, that I
might perform thy will: yet let me not err: let me
hear again thy me&longs;&longs;enger!”
He &longs;tood for a minute as if li&longs;tening; but recovering
from his attitude, he continued—“It is not
needed. Da&longs;tardly wretch! thus eternally questioning
the behe&longs;ts of thy Maker! weak in resolution!
wayward in faith!”
He advanced to me, and, after another pau&longs;e, resumed:
“Poor girl! a di&longs;mal fate has &longs;et its mark
upon thee. Thy life is demanded as a &longs;acrifice.
Prepare thee to die. Make not my office difficult
by fruitle&longs;s oppo&longs;ition. Thy prayers might &longs;ubdue




&longs;tones; but none but he who enjoined my purpo&longs;e
can &longs;hake it.”
The&longs;e words were a &longs;ufficient explication of the
&longs;cene. The nature of his phrenzy, as de&longs;cribed by
my uncle, was remembered. I who had &longs;ought
death, was now thrilled with horror becau&longs;e it was
near. Death in this form, death from the hand of
a brother, was thought upon with unde&longs;cribable
repugnance.
In a &longs;tate thus verging upon madne&longs;s, my eye
glanced upon Carwin. His a&longs;toni&longs;hment appeared
to have &longs;truck him motionle&longs;s and dumb. My life
was in danger, and my brother's hand was about
to be embrued in my blood. I firmly believed that
Carwin's was the in&longs;tigation. I could re&longs;cue me
from this abhorred fate; I could di&longs;&longs;ipate this tremendous
illu&longs;ion; I could &longs;ave my brother from the
perpetration of new horrors, by pointing out the
devil who &longs;educed him; to he&longs;itate a moment was
to peri&longs;h. The&longs;e thoughts gave &longs;trength to my limbs,
and energy to my accents: I &longs;tarted on my feet.
“O brother! &longs;pare me, &longs;pare thy&longs;elf: There
is thy betrayer. He counterfeited the voice and
face of an angel, for the purpo&longs;e of de&longs;troying thee
and me. He has this moment confe&longs;&longs;ed it. He is
able to &longs;peak where he is not. He is leagued with
hell, but will not avow it; yet he confe&longs;&longs;es that the
agency was his.”
My brother turned &longs;lowly his eyes, and fixed
them upon Carwin. Every joint in the frame of
the latter trembled. His complexion was paler than
a gho&longs;t's. His eye dared not meet that of Wieland,
but wandered with an air of di&longs;traction from one
&longs;pace to another.
“Man,” &longs;aid my brother, in a voice totally unlike
that which he had u&longs;ed to me, “what art




thou? The charge has been made. An&longs;wer it.
The vi&longs;age—the voice—at the bottom of the&longs;e
&longs;tairs—at the hour of eleven—To whom did they
belong? To thee?”
Twice did Carwin attempt to &longs;peak, but his
words died away upon his lips. My brother resumed
in a tone of greater vehemence—
“Thou faltere&longs;t; faltering is ominous; &longs;ay yes
or no: one word will &longs;uffice; but beware of falsehood.
Was it a &longs;tratagem of hell to overthrow
my family? Wa&longs;t thou the agent?”
I now &longs;aw that the wrath which had been prepared
for me was to be heaped upon another. The
tale that I heard from him, and his pre&longs;ent trepidations,
were abundant te&longs;timonies of his guilt. But
what if Wieland &longs;hould be undeceived! What if
he &longs;hall find his acts to have proceeded not from an
heavenly prompter, but from human treachery!
Will not his rage mount into whirlwind? Will not
he rare limb this devoted wretch?
In&longs;tinctively I recoiled from this image, but it
gave place to another. Carwin may be innocent,
but the impetuo&longs;ity of his judge may mi&longs;con&longs;true
his an&longs;wers into a con&longs;e&longs;&longs;ion of guilt. Wieland
knows not that my&longs;terious voices and appearances
were likewi&longs;e witne&longs;&longs;ed by me. Carwin may be
ignorant of tho&longs;e which mi&longs;led my brother. Thus
may his an&longs;wers unwarily betray him&longs;elf to ruin.
Such might be the con&longs;equences of my frantic
precipitation, and the&longs;e, it was nece&longs;&longs;ary, if po&longs;&longs;ible,
to prevent. I attempted to &longs;peak, but Wieland,
turning &longs;uddenly upon me, commanded &longs;ilence, in
a tone furious and terrible. My lips clo&longs;ed, and
my tongue refu&longs;ed its office.
“What art thou?” he re&longs;umed, addre&longs;&longs;ing
him&longs;elf to Carwin. “An&longs;wer me; who&longs;e form—




who&longs;e voice—was it thy contrivance? An&longs;wer
me.”
The an&longs;wer was now given, but confu&longs;edly and
&longs;carcely articulated. “I meant nothing—I intended
no ill—if I under&longs;tand—if I do not mi&longs;take you—it
is too true—I did appear—in the entry—did &longs;peak.
The contrivance was mine, but—”
The&longs;e words were no &longs;ooner uttered, than my
brother cea&longs;ed to wear the &longs;ame a&longs;pect. His eyes
were downca&longs;t: he was motionle&longs;s: his re&longs;piration
became hoar&longs;e, like that of a man in the agonies of
death. Carwin &longs;eemed unable to &longs;ay more. He
might have ea&longs;ily e&longs;caped, but the thought which
occupied him related to what was horrid and unintelligible
in this &longs;cene, and not to his own danger.
Pre&longs;ently the faculties of Wieland, which, for a
time, were chained up, were &longs;eized with re&longs;tle&longs;&longs;ne&longs;s
and trembling. He broke &longs;ilence. The &longs;toute&longs;t
heart would have been appalled by the tone in
which he &longs;poke. He addre&longs;&longs;ed him&longs;elf to Carwin.
“Why art thou here? Who detains thee? Go
and learn better. I will meet thee, but it mu&longs;t he
at the bar of thy Maker. There &longs;hall I bear witness
again&longs;t thee.”
Perceiving that Carwin did not obey, he continued;
“Do&longs;t thou wi&longs;h me to complete the catalogue
by thy death? Thy life is a worthle&longs;e thing.
Tempt me no more. I am but a man, and thy
pre&longs;ence may awaken a &longs;ury which may &longs;purn my
controul. Begone!”
Carwin, irre&longs;olute, &longs;triving in vain for utterance,
his complexion pallid as death, his knees beating
one again&longs;t another, &longs;lowly obeyed the mandate and
withdrew.
