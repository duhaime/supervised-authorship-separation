To Mrs. Talboy.
New-York, Oct. 22.

You tell me, my dear Jane, that you are
coming to reside in this city, but you have not
gratified my impatience by saying how soon.
Tell me when you propose to come. Is there
not something in which I can be of service to
you? Some preparations to be made?
Tell me the day when you expect to arrive
among us, that I may wait on you as soon as
possible.
I shall embrace my sister, with a delight
which I cannot express. I will not part with
the delightful hope of one day calling you truly
suchâ€”







Accept the fraternal regards of Mr. Montford.


M. M.
