TO CLARA HOWARD.
Philadelphia, May 11.






Thanks, a thousand thanks, my beloved
friend, for thy story. It has absorbed and
overwhelmed every other thought and feeling.
Since I received it, I have done nothing but
peruse and ponder on thy letter. It has opened
cheerful prospects for my poor friend. Shall
we not see her restored to her native country:
to her original rank, and the affluence to which
she is entitled by her birth, her education and
her former sufferings? I trust, we shall.
'Tis impossible to guess how far she is acquainted
with the history of her parents: but
that and every other doubt will, I hope, speedily
be put to flight.






I hope that this is the last letter I shall
have occasion to write to you. The next time
I shall address you, will be through no such
wild and ambiguous medium.
May I find my Clara all gentleness; all
condescension; all love. So, with all his
heart, prays her

Edward.
