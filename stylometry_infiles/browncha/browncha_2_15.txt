TO MISS HOWARD.
Philadelphia, April 23.











When you know my reason for not accompanying
your father, you will approve of
my conduct. I am once more in health, but
could not, at this season, perform the journey
without hazard. Meanwhile, some affairs remain
to be transacted in this city, to which my
strength is fully equal; and the assurance of
your love, has lulled all my cares to repose.
In less than a week I will be with you.
Rely upon my power to convince you that your
present decision is just. If I had doubts of its
rectitude, your offer, transporting as it is,
would never be accepted.






How little did you comprehend my character,
in believing me capable of urging you
to the commission of what I deemed wrong!
And think you that even now I will accept
your hand, unattended with the fullest concurrence
of your reason? No: but I doubt not
to obtain that concurrence. I will fly to you
on the wings of transport, and armed with
reasons which shall fully remove your scruples.
These reasons, as well as a thousand affecting
incidents which have lately befallen me, I
will reserve for our meeting. Meanwhile,
place the inclosed portrait in your bosom. It
is that of my nurse, Mrs. Aston. She sends
it to you, and desires me to tell you that she
has received your letter, and will answer it
very shortly. Adieu.

E. H.
P.S. I stay at No....., north Eighth-street.
