Early in the morning of a &longs;ultry day in August,
he left Mettingen, to go to the city. He had
&longs;eldom pa&longs;&longs;ed a day from home &longs;ince his return
from the &longs;hores of the Ohio. Some urgent engagements
at this time exi&longs;ted, which would not
admit of further delay. He returned in the evening,
but appeared to be greatly oppre&longs;&longs;ed with fatigue.
His &longs;ilence and dejection were likewi&longs;e in
a more than ordinary degree con&longs;picuous. My
mother's brother, who&longs;e profe&longs;&longs;ion was that of a
&longs;urgeon, chanced to &longs;pend this night at our hou&longs;e.
It was from him that I have frequently received an
exact account of the mournful cata&longs;trophe that
followed.
As the evening advanced, my father's inquietudes
increa&longs;ed. He &longs;at with his family as u&longs;ual, but
took no part in their conver&longs;ation. He appeared
fully engro&longs;&longs;ed by his own reflections. Occasionally
his countenance exhibited tokens of alarm; he
gazed &longs;tedfa&longs;tly and wildly at the ceiling; and the
exertions of his companions were &longs;carcely sufficient
to interrupt his reverie. On recovering from
the&longs;e fits, he expre&longs;&longs;ed no &longs;urprize; but pre&longs;&longs;ing his
hand to his head, complained, in a tremulous and
terrified tone, that his brain was &longs;corched to cinders.
He would then betray marks of in&longs;upportable anxiety.

My uncle perceived, by his pul&longs;e, that he was indisposed,
but in no alarming degree, and a&longs;cribed
appearances chiefly to the workings of his mind.
He exhorted him to recollection and compo&longs;ure, but





in vain. At the hour of repo&longs;e he readily retired
to his chamber. At the per&longs;ua&longs;ion of my mother
he even undre&longs;&longs;ed and went to bed. Nothing could
abate his re&longs;tle&longs;&longs;ne&longs;s. He checked her tender expostulations
with &longs;ome &longs;ternne&longs;s. “Be &longs;ilent,” &longs;aid
he, “for that which I feel there is but one cure,
and that will &longs;hortly come. You can help me nothing.
Look to your own condition, and pray to
God to &longs;trengthen you under the calamities that
await you.” “What am I to fear?” &longs;he answered.
“What terrible di&longs;a&longs;ter is it that you think
of?” “Peace—as yet I know it not my&longs;elf, but
come it will, and &longs;hortly.” She repeated her inquiries
and doubts; but he &longs;uddenly put an end to
the di&longs;cour&longs;e, by a &longs;tern command to be &longs;ilent.
She had never before known him in this mood.
Hitherto all was benign in his deportment. Her
heart was pierced with &longs;orrow at the contemplation
of this change. She was utterly unable to account
for it, or to figure to her&longs;elf the &longs;pecies of di&longs;a&longs;ter
that was menaced.
Contrary to cu&longs;tom, the lamp, in&longs;tead of being
placed on the hearth, was left upon the table. Over
it again&longs;t the wall there hung a &longs;mall clock, &longs;o contrived
as to &longs;trike a very hard &longs;troke at the end of
every &longs;ixth hour. That which was now approaching
was the &longs;ignal for retiring to the fane at which he
addre&longs;&longs;ed his devotions. Long habit had occasioned
him to be always awake at this hour, and the
toll was in&longs;tantly obeyed.
Now frequent and anxious glances were ca&longs;t at
the clock. Not a &longs;ingle movement of the index
appeared to e&longs;cape his notice. As the hour verged
towards twelve his anxiety vi&longs;ibly augmented. The
trepidations of my mother kept pace with tho&longs;e of
her hu&longs;band; but &longs;he was intimidated into &longs;ilence.




All that was left to her was to watch every change
of his features, and give vent to her &longs;ympathy in
tears.
At length the hour was &longs;pent, and the clock tolled.
The &longs;ound appeared to communicate a &longs;hock
to every part of my father's frame. He ro&longs;e immediately,
and threw over him&longs;elf a loo&longs;e gown.
Even this office was performed with difficulty, for
his joints trembled, and his teeth chattered with dismay.
At this hour his duty called him to the rock,
and my mother naturally concluded that it was thither
he intended to repair. Yet the&longs;e incidents
were &longs;o uncommon, as to fill her with astonishment
and foreboding. She &longs;aw him leave the room,
and heard his &longs;teps as they ha&longs;tily de&longs;cended the
&longs;tairs. She half re&longs;olved to ri&longs;e and pur&longs;ue him,
but the wildne&longs;s of the &longs;cheme quickly &longs;ugge&longs;ted
it&longs;elf. He was going to a place whither no power
on earth could induce him to &longs;uffer an attendant.
The window of her chamber looked toward the
rock. The atmo&longs;phere was clear and calm, but
the edifice could not be di&longs;covered at that di&longs;tance
through the du&longs;k. My mother's anxiety would
not allow her to remain where &longs;he was. She ro&longs;e,
and &longs;eated her&longs;elf at the window. She &longs;trained her
&longs;ight to get a view of the dome, and of the path
that led to it. The fir&longs;t painted it&longs;elf with &longs;ufficient
di&longs;tinctne&longs;s on her fancy, but was undi&longs;tingui&longs;hable
by the eye from the rocky ma&longs;s on which it was
erected. The &longs;econd could be imperfectly &longs;een;
but her hu&longs;band had already pa&longs;&longs;ed, or had taken
a different direction.
What was it that &longs;he feared? Some di&longs;a&longs;ter impended
over her hu&longs;band or her&longs;elf. He had predicted
evils, but profe&longs;&longs;ed him&longs;elf ignorant of what
nature they were. When were they to come?




Was this night, or this hour to witne&longs;s the accomplishment?
She was tortured with impatience, and
uncertainty. All her fears were at pre&longs;ent linked
to his per&longs;on, and &longs;he gazed at the clock, with nearly
as much eagerne&longs;s as my father had done, in expectation
of the next hour.
An half hour pa&longs;&longs;ed away in this &longs;tate of suspence.
Her eyes were fixed upon the rock; suddenly
it was illuminated. A light proceeding from
the edifice, made every part of the &longs;cene vi&longs;ible. A
gleam diffu&longs;ed it&longs;elf over the intermediate &longs;pace,
and in&longs;tantly a loud report, like the explo&longs;ion of a
mine, followed. She uttered an involuntary &longs;hriek,
but the new &longs;ounds that greeted her ear, quickly
conquered her &longs;urpri&longs;e. They were piercing
&longs;hrieks, and uttered without intermi&longs;&longs;ion. The
gleams which had diffu&longs;ed them&longs;elves far and wide
were in a moment withdrawn, but the interior of
the edifice was filled with rays.
The fir&longs;t &longs;ugge&longs;tion was that a pi&longs;tol was discharged,
and that the &longs;tructure was on fire. She
did not allow her&longs;elf time to meditate a &longs;econd
thought, but ru&longs;hed into the entry and knocked
loudly at the door of her brother's chamber. My
uncle had been previou&longs;ly rou&longs;ed by the noi&longs;e, and
in&longs;tantly flew to the window. He al&longs;o imagined
what he &longs;aw to be fire. The loud and vehement
&longs;hrieks which &longs;ucceeded the fir&longs;t explo&longs;ion, &longs;eemed
to be an invocation of &longs;uccour. The incident was
inexplicable; but he could not fail to perceive the
propriety of ha&longs;tening to the &longs;pot. He was unbolting
the door, when his &longs;i&longs;ter's voice was heard
on the out&longs;ide conjuring him to come forth.
He obeyed the &longs;ummons with all the &longs;peed in his
power. He &longs;topped not to que&longs;tion her, but hurried
down &longs;tairs and acro&longs;s the meadow which lay




between the hou&longs;e and the rock. The &longs;hrieks
were no longer to be heard; but a blazing light was
clearly di&longs;cernible between the columns of the
temple. Irregular &longs;teps, hewn in the &longs;tone, led him
to the &longs;ummit. On three &longs;ides, this edifice touched
the very verge of the cliff. On the fourth &longs;ide, which
might be regarded as the front, there was an area
of &longs;mall extent, to which the rude &longs;tairca&longs;e conducted
you. My uncle &longs;peedily gained this &longs;pot.
His &longs;trength was for a moment exhau&longs;ted by his
ha&longs;te. He pau&longs;ed to re&longs;t him&longs;elf. Meanwhile he
bent the mo&longs;t vigilant attention towards the object
before him.
Within the columns he beheld what he could no
better de&longs;cribe, than by &longs;aying that it re&longs;embled a
cloud impregnated with light. It had the brightness
of flame, but was without its upward motion.
It did not occupy the whole area, and ro&longs;e but a
few feet above the floor. No part of the building
was on fire. This appearance was a&longs;toni&longs;hing.
He approached the temple. As he went forward
the light retired, and, when he put his feet within
the apartment, utterly vani&longs;hed. The &longs;uddenne&longs;s of
this tran&longs;ition increa&longs;ed the darkne&longs;s that &longs;ucceeded
in a tenfold degree. Fear and wonder rendered him
powerle&longs;s. An occurrence like this, in a place
a&longs;&longs;igned to devotion, was adapted to intimidate the
&longs;toute&longs;t heart.
His wandering thoughts were recalled by the
groans of one near him. His &longs;ight gradually recovered
its power, and he was able to di&longs;cern my
father &longs;tretched on the floor. At that moment, my
mother and &longs;ervants arrived with a lanthorn, and
enabled my uncle to examine more clo&longs;ely this
&longs;cene. My father, when he left the hou&longs;e, be&longs;ides
a loo&longs;e upper ve&longs;t and &longs;lippers, wore a &longs;hirt and





drawers. Now he was naked, his &longs;kin throughout
the greater part of his body was &longs;corched and
brui&longs;ed. His right arm exhibited marks as of having
been &longs;truck by &longs;ome heavy body. His clothes had
been removed, and it was not immediately perceived
that they were reduced to a&longs;hes. His &longs;lippers and
his hair were untouched.
He was removed to his chamber, and the requisite
attention paid to his wounds, which gradually
became more painful. A mortification &longs;peedily
&longs;hewed it&longs;elf in the arm, which had been mo&longs;t
hurt. Soon after, the other wounded parts exhibited
the like appearance.
Immediately &longs;ub&longs;equent to this di&longs;a&longs;ter, my father
&longs;eemed nearly in a &longs;tate of in&longs;en&longs;ibility. He was
pa&longs;&longs;ive under every operation. He &longs;carcely opened
his eyes, and was with difficulty prevailed upon to
an&longs;wer the que&longs;tions that were put to him. By
his imperfect account, it appeared, that while engaged
in &longs;ilent ori&longs;ons, with thoughts full of confusion
and anxiety, a faint gleam &longs;uddenly &longs;hot
athwart the apartment. His fancy immediately
pictured to it&longs;elf, a per&longs;on bearing a lamp. It
&longs;eemed to come from behind. He was in the act
of turning to examine the vi&longs;itant, when his right
arm received a blow from a heavy club. At the
&longs;ame in&longs;tant, a very bright &longs;park was &longs;een to light
upon his clothes. In a moment, the whole was
reduced to a&longs;hes. This was the &longs;um of the information
which he cho&longs;e to give. There was somewhat
in his manner that indicated an imperfect
tale. My uncle was inclined to believe that half
the truth had been &longs;uppre&longs;&longs;ed.
Meanwhile, the di&longs;ea&longs;e thus wonderfully generated,
betrayed more terrible &longs;ymptoms. Fever and
delirium terminated in lethargic &longs;lumber, which,




in the cour&longs;e of two hours, gave place to death.
Yet not till in&longs;upportable exhalations and crawling
putrefaction had driven from his chamber and the
hou&longs;e every one whom their duty did not detain.
Such was the end of my father. None &longs;urely
was ever more my&longs;terious. When we recollect his
gloomy anticipations and unconquerable anxiety;
the &longs;ecurity from human malice which his character,
the place, and the condition of the times, might
be &longs;uppo&longs;ed to confer; the purity and cloudlessness
of the atmo&longs;phere, which rended it impo&longs;&longs;ible
that lightning was the cau&longs;e; what are the conclusions
that we mu&longs;t form?
The prelu&longs;ive gleam, the blow upon his arm,
the fatal &longs;park, the explo&longs;ion heard &longs;o far, the
fiery cloud that environed him, without detriment
to the &longs;tructure, though compo&longs;ed of combustible
materials, the &longs;udden vani&longs;hing of this
cloud at my uncle's approach—what is the inference
to be drawn from the&longs;e facts? Their truth
cannot be doubted. My uncle's te&longs;timony is peculiarly
worthy of credit, becau&longs;e no man's temper
is more &longs;ceptical, and his belief is unalterably attached
to natural cau&longs;es.
I was at this time a child of &longs;ix years of age.
The impre&longs;&longs;ions that were then made upon me,
can never be effaced. I was ill qualified to judge
re&longs;pecting what was then pa&longs;&longs;ing; but as I advanced
in age, and became more fully acquainted with
the&longs;e facts, they oftener became the &longs;ubject of my
thoughts. Their re&longs;emblance to recent events revived
them with new force in my memory, and
made me more anxious to explain them. Was this
the penalty of di&longs;obedience? this the &longs;troke of a
vindictive and invi&longs;ible hand? Is it a fre&longs;h proof
that the Divine Ruler interferes in human affairs,




meditates an end, &longs;elects, and commi&longs;&longs;ions his
agents, and enforces, by unequivocal &longs;anctions,
&longs;ubmi&longs;&longs;ion to his will? Or, was it merely the irregular
expan&longs;ion of the fluid that imparts warmth
to our heart and our blood, cau&longs;ed by the fatigue
of the preceding day, or flowing, by e&longs;tabli&longs;hed
laws, from the condition of his thoughts? *
