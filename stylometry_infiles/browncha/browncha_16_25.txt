The inhabitants of the HUT received me with
a mixture of joy and &longs;urprize. Their homely welcome,
and their artle&longs;s &longs;ympathy, were grateful to
my feelings. In the mid&longs;t of their inquiries, as to
my health, they avoided all allu&longs;ions to the &longs;ource
of my malady. They were hone&longs;t creatures, and
I loved them well. I participated in the tears which
they &longs;hed when I mentioned to them my &longs;peedy departure
for Europe, and promi&longs;ed to acquaint them
with my welfare during my long ab&longs;ence.
They expre&longs;&longs;ed great &longs;urprize when I informed
them of my intention to vi&longs;it my cottage. Alarm
and foreboding over&longs;pread their features, and they
attempted to di&longs;&longs;uade me from vi&longs;iting an hou&longs;e
which they firmly believed to be haunted by a thousand
gha&longs;tly apparitions.
The&longs;e apprehen&longs;ions, however, had no power
over my conduct. I took an irregular path which
led me to my own hou&longs;e. All was vacant and forlorn.
A &longs;mall enclo&longs;ure, near which the path led,
was the burying-ground belonging to the family.
This I was obliged to pa&longs;s. Once I had intended
to enter it, and ponder on the emblems and inscriptions
which my uncle had cau&longs;ed to be made on
the tombs of Catharine and her children; but now
my heart faltered as I approached, and I ha&longs;tened
forward, that di&longs;tance might conceal it from my
view.
When I approached the rece&longs;s, my heart again
&longs;unk. I averted my eyes, and left it behind me as




quickly as po&longs;&longs;ible. Silence reigned through my
habitation, and a darkne&longs;s which clo&longs;ed doors and
&longs;hutters produced. Every object was connected
with mine or my brother's hi&longs;tory. I pa&longs;&longs;ed the
entry, mounted the &longs;tair, and unlocked the door of
my chamber. It was with difficulty that I curbed
my fancy and &longs;mothered my fears. Slight movements
and ca&longs;ual &longs;ounds were transformed into beckoning
&longs;hadows and calling &longs;hapes.
I proceeded to the clo&longs;et. I opened and looked
round it with fearfulne&longs;s. All things were in their
accu&longs;tomed order. I &longs;ought and found the manuscript
where I was u&longs;ed to depo&longs;it it. This being
&longs;ecured, there was nothing to detain me; yet I &longs;tood
and contemplated awhile the furniture and walls of
my chamber. I remembered how long this apartment
had been a &longs;weet and tranquil
a&longs;ylum; I compared
its former &longs;tate with its pre&longs;ent drearine&longs;s,
and reflected that I now beheld it for the la&longs;t time.
Here it was that the incomprehen&longs;ible behaviour
of Carwin was witne&longs;&longs;ed: this the &longs;tage on which
that enemy of man &longs;hewed him&longs;elf for a moment
unma&longs;ked. Here the menaces of murder were
wa&longs;ted to my ear; and here the&longs;e menaces were
executed.
The&longs;e thoughts had a tendency to take from me
my &longs;elf-command. My feeble limbs refu&longs;ed to support
me, and I &longs;unk upon a chair. Incoherent and
half-articulate exclamations e&longs;caped my lips. The
name of Carwin was uttered, and eternal woes,
woes like that which his malice had entailed upon
us, were heaped upon him. I invoked all-&longs;eeing
heaven to drag to light and to puni&longs;h this betrayer,
and accu&longs;ed its providence for having thus long
delayed the retribution that was due to &longs;o enormous
a guilt.






I have &longs;aid that the window &longs;hutters were clo&longs;ed.
A feeble light, however, found entrance through the
crevices. A &longs;mall window illuminated the clo&longs;et,
and the door being clo&longs;ed, a dim ray &longs;treamed
through the key-hole. A kind of twilight was thus
created, &longs;ufficient for the purpo&longs;es of vi&longs;ion; but,
at the &longs;ame time, involving all minuter objects in
ob&longs;curity.
This darkne&longs;s &longs;uited the colour of my thoughts.
I &longs;ickened at the remembrance of the pa&longs;t. The
pro&longs;pect of the future excited my loathing. I muttered
in a low voice, Why &longs;hould I live longer?
Why &longs;hould I drag a mi&longs;erable being? All, for
whom I ought to live, have peri&longs;hed. Am I not
my&longs;elf hunted to death?
At that moment, my de&longs;pair &longs;uddenly became
vigorous. My nerves were no longer un&longs;trung.
My powers, that had long been deadened, were revived.
My bo&longs;om &longs;welled with a &longs;udden energy,
and the conviction darted through my mind, that
to end my torments was, at once, practicable and
wi&longs;e.
I knew how to find way to the rece&longs;&longs;es of life.
I could u&longs;e a laneet with &longs;ome &longs;kill, and could distinguish
between vein and artery. By piercing deep
into the latter, I &longs;hould &longs;hun the evils which the
future had in &longs;tore for me, and take refuge from my
woes in quiet death.
I &longs;tarted on my feet, for my feeblene&longs;s was gone,
and ha&longs;ted to the clo&longs;et. A lancet and other &longs;mall
in&longs;truments were pre&longs;erved in a ca&longs;e which I had
depo&longs;ited here. Inattentive as I was to foreign considerations,
my ears were &longs;till open to any &longs;ound of
my&longs;terious import that &longs;hould occur. I thought I
heard a &longs;tep in the entry. My purpo&longs;e was suspended,
and I ca&longs;t an eager glance at my chamber




door, which was open. No one appeared, unle&longs;s
the &longs;hadow which I di&longs;cerned upon the floor, was
the outline of a man. If it were, I was authorized
to &longs;u&longs;pect that &longs;ome one was po&longs;ted clo&longs;e to the entrance,
who po&longs;&longs;ibly had overheard my exclamations.

My teeth chattered, and a wild confu&longs;ion took
place of my momentary calm. Thus it was when
a terrific vi&longs;age had di&longs;clo&longs;ed it&longs;elf on a former night.
Thus it was when the evil de&longs;tiny of Wieland assumed
the lineaments of &longs;omething human. What
horrid apparition was preparing to bla&longs;t my &longs;ight?
Still I li&longs;tened and gazed. Not long, for the
&longs;hadow moved; a foot, un&longs;hapely and huge, was
thru&longs;t forward; a form advanced from its concealment,
and &longs;talked into the room. It was Carwin!
While I had breath I &longs;hrieked. While I had
power over my mu&longs;cles, I motioned with my hand
that he &longs;hould vani&longs;h. My exertions could not la&longs;t
long; I &longs;unk into a fit.
O that this grateful oblivion had la&longs;ted for ever!
Too quickly I recovered my &longs;en&longs;es. The power
of di&longs;tinct vi&longs;ion was no &longs;ooner re&longs;tored to me, than
this hateful form again pre&longs;ented it&longs;elf, and I once
more relap&longs;ed.
A &longs;econd time, untoward nature recalled me from
the &longs;leep of death. I found my&longs;elf &longs;tretched upon
the bed. When I had power to look up, I remembered
only that I had cau&longs;e to fear. My distempered
fancy fa&longs;hioned to it&longs;elf no di&longs;tingui&longs;hable
image. I threw a languid glance round me; once
more my eyes lighted upon Carwin.
He was &longs;eated on the floor, his back re&longs;ted again&longs;t
the wall, his knees were drawn up, and his face was
buried in his hands. That his &longs;tation was at &longs;ome
di&longs;tance, that his attitude was not menacing, that




his ominous vi&longs;age was concealed, may account for
my now e&longs;caping a &longs;hock, violent as tho&longs;e which
were pa&longs;t. I withdrew my eyes, but was not again
de&longs;erted by my &longs;en&longs;es.
On perceiving that I had recovered my &longs;en&longs;ibility,
he lifted his head. This motion attracted my
attention. His countenance was mild, but &longs;orrow
and a&longs;toni&longs;hment &longs;at upon his features. I averted
my eyes and feebly exclaimed—“O! fly—fly far
and for ever!—I cannot behold you and live!”
He did not ri&longs;e upon his feet, but cla&longs;ped his
hands, and faid in a tone of deprecation—“I will
fly. I am become a fiend, the &longs;ight of whom destroys.
Yet tell me my offence! You have linked
cur&longs;es with my name; you a&longs;cribe to me a malice
mon&longs;trous and infernal. I look around; all is
loneline&longs;s and de&longs;ert! This hou&longs;e and your brother's
are &longs;olitary and di&longs;mantled! You die away
at the &longs;ight of me! My fear whi&longs;pers that &longs;ome
deed of horror has been perpetrated; that I am the
unde&longs;igning cau&longs;e.”
What language was this? Had he not avowed
him&longs;elf a ravi&longs;her? Had not this chamber witne&longs;&longs;ed
his atrocious purpo&longs;es? I be&longs;ought him with new
vehemence to go.
He lifted his eyes—“Great heaven! what have
I done? I think I know the extent of my offences.
I have acted, but my actions have po&longs;&longs;ibly effected
more than I de&longs;igned. This fear has brought
me back from my retreat. I come to repair the
evil of which my ra&longs;hne&longs;s was the cau&longs;e, and to
prevent more evil. I come to confe&longs;s my errors.”
“Wretch!” I cried when my &longs;uffocating emotions
would permit me to &longs;peak, “the gho&longs;ts of my
&longs;i&longs;ter and her children, do they not ri&longs;e to accu&longs;e
thee? Who was it that bla&longs;ted the intellects of




Wieland? Who was it that urged him to fury,
and guided him to murder? Who, but thou and
the devil, with whom thou art confederated?”
At the&longs;e words a new &longs;pirit pervaded his countenance.
His eyes once more appealed to heaven.
“If I have memory, if I have being, I am innocent.
I intended no ill; but my folly, indirectly
and remotely, may have cau&longs;ed it; but what words
are the&longs;e! Your brother lunatic! His children
dead!”
What &longs;hould I infer from this deportment? Was
the ignorance which the&longs;e words implied real or
pretended?—Yet how could I imagine a mere human
agency in the&longs;e events? But if the influence
was preternatural or maniacal in my brother's ca&longs;e,
they mu&longs;t be equally &longs;o in my own. Then I remembered
that the voice exerted, was to &longs;ave me
from Carwin's attempts. The&longs;e ideas tended to
abate my abhorrence of this man, and to detect the
ab&longs;urdity of my accu&longs;ations.
“Alas!” &longs;aid I, “I have no one to accu&longs;e.
Leave me to my fate. Fly from a &longs;cene &longs;tained
with cruelty; devoted to de&longs;pair.”
Carwin &longs;tood for a time mu&longs;ing and mournful.
At length he faid, “What has happened? I came
to expiate my crimes: let me know them in their
full extent. I have horrible forebodings! What
has happened?”
I was &longs;ilent; but recollecting the intimation given
by this man when he was detected in my closet,
which implied &longs;ome knowledge of that power
which interfered in my favor, I eagerly inquired,
“What was that voice which called upon me to
hold when I attempted to open the clo&longs;et? What
face was that which I &longs;aw at the bottom of the
&longs;tairs? An&longs;wer me truly.”






“I came to confe&longs;s the truth. Your allu&longs;ions
are horrible and &longs;trange. Perhaps I have but &longs;aint
conceptions of the evils which my infatuation has
produced; but what remains I will perform. It was
my voice that you heard! It was my face that
you &longs;aw!”
For a moment I doubted whether my remembrance
of events were not confu&longs;ed. How could
he be at once &longs;tationed at my &longs;houlder and &longs;hut up
in my clo&longs;et? How could he &longs;tand near me and
yet be invi&longs;ible? But if Carwin's were the thrilling
voice and the fiery vi&longs;age which I had heard
and &longs;een, then was he the prompter of my brother,
and the author of the&longs;e di&longs;mal outrages.
Once more I averted my eyes and &longs;truggled for
&longs;peech. “Begone! thou man of mi&longs;chief! Remorseless
and implacable mi&longs;creant! begone!”
“I will obey,” &longs;aid he in a di&longs;con&longs;olate voice;
“yet, wretch as I am, am I unworthy to repair
the evils that I have committed? I came as a repentant
criminal. It is you whom I have injured,
and at your bar am I willing to appear, and confe&longs;s
and expiate my crimes. I have deceived you: I
have &longs;ported with your terrors: I have plotted to
de&longs;troy your reputation. I come now to remove
your errors; to &longs;et you beyond the reach of &longs;imilar
fears; to rebuild your &longs;ame as far as I am able.
“This is the amount of my guilt, and this the
fruit of my remor&longs;e. Will you not hear me? Listen
to my con&longs;e&longs;&longs;ion, and then denounce punishment.
All I a&longs;k is a patient audience.”
“What!” I replied, “was not thine the voice
that commanded my brother to imbrue his hands in
the blood of his children—to &longs;trangle that angel of
&longs;weetne&longs;s his wife? Has he not vowed my death,
and the death of Pleyel, at thy bidding? Ha&longs;t thou





not made him the butcher of his family; changed
him who was the glory of his &longs;pecies into wor&longs;e
than brute; robbed him of rea&longs;on, and con&longs;igned
the re&longs;t of his days to fetters and &longs;tripes?”
Carwin's eyes glared, and his limbs were petrified
at this intelligence. No words were requi&longs;ite
to prove him guiltle&longs;s of the&longs;e enormities: at the
time, however, I was nearly in&longs;en&longs;ible to the&longs;e exculpatory
tokens. He walked to the farther end
of the room, and having recovered fome degree of
compo&longs;ure, he &longs;poke—
“I am not this villain; I have &longs;lain no one; I
have prompted none to &longs;lay; I have handled a tool
of wonderful efficacy without malignant intentions,
but without caution; ample will be the puni&longs;hment
of my temerity, if my conduct has contributed to
this evil.” He pau&longs;ed.—
I likewi&longs;e was &longs;ilent. I &longs;truggled to command
my&longs;elf &longs;o far as to li&longs;ten to the tale which he &longs;hould
tell. Ob&longs;erving this, he continued—
“You are not apprized of the exi&longs;tence of a
power which I po&longs;&longs;e&longs;s. I know not by what name
to call it.* It enables me to mimic exactly the




voice of another, and to modify the &longs;ound &longs;o that
it &longs;hall appear to come from what quarter, and be
uttered at what di&longs;tance I plea&longs;e.
“I know not that every one po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;es this power.
Perhaps, though a ca&longs;ual po&longs;ition of my organs in
my youth &longs;hewed me that I po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;ed it, it is an art
which may be taught to all. Would to God I had
died unknowing of the &longs;ecret! It has produced nothing
but degradation and calamity.
“For a time the po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;ion of &longs;o potent and stupendous
an endowment elated me with pride. Unfortified
by principle, &longs;ubjected to poverty, stimulated
by headlong pa&longs;&longs;ions, I made this powerful
engine &longs;ub&longs;ervient to the &longs;upply of my wants, and
the gratification of my vanity. I &longs;hall not mention
how diligently I cultivated this gift, which &longs;eemed
capable of unlimited improvement; nor detail the
various occa&longs;ions on which it was &longs;ucce&longs;sfully exerted
to lead &longs;uper&longs;tition, conquer avarice, or excite
awe.
“I left America, which is my native &longs;oil, in my
youth. I have been engaged in various &longs;cenes of
life, in which my peculiar talent has been exercised
with more or le&longs;s &longs;ucce&longs;s. I was finally betrayed
by one who called him&longs;elf my friend, into acts
which cannot be ju&longs;tified, though they are susceptible
of apology.






“The perfidy of this man compelled me to withdraw
from Europe. I returned to my native country,
uncertain whether &longs;ilence and ob&longs;curity would
&longs;ave me from his malice. I re&longs;ided in the purlieus
of the city. I put on the garb and a&longs;&longs;umed the
manners of a clown.
“My chief recreation was walking. My principal
haunts were the lawns and gardens of Mettingen.
In this delightful region the luxuriances
of nature had been cha&longs;tened by judicious art, and
each &longs;ucce&longs;&longs;ive contemplation unfolded new enchantments.

“I was &longs;tudious of &longs;eclu&longs;ion: I was &longs;atiated
with the intercour&longs;e of mankind, and di&longs;cretion required
me to &longs;hun their intercour&longs;e. For the&longs;e reasons
I long avoided the ob&longs;ervation of your family,
and chiefly vi&longs;ited the&longs;e precincts at night.
“I was never weary of admiring the po&longs;ition
and ornaments of the temple. Many a night have
I pa&longs;&longs;ed under its roof, revolving no plea&longs;ing meditations.
When, in my frequent rambles, I perceived
this apartment was occupied, I gave a different
direction to my &longs;teps. One evening, when
a &longs;hower had ju&longs;t pa&longs;&longs;ed, judging by the &longs;ilence that
no one was within, I a&longs;cended to this building.
Glancing carele&longs;&longs;ly round, I perceived an open letter
on the pede&longs;tal. To read it was doubtle&longs;s an
offence again&longs;t
politene&longs;s. Of this offence, however,
I was guilty.
“Scarcely had I gone half through when I was
alarmed by the approach of your brother. To
&longs;cramble down the cliff on the oppo&longs;ite &longs;ide was
impracticable. I was unprepared to meet a stranger.
Be&longs;ides the aukwardne&longs;s attending &longs;uch an
interview in the&longs;e circum&longs;tances, concealment was
nece&longs;&longs;ary to my &longs;afety. A thou&longs;and times had I




vowed never again to employ the dangerous talent
which I po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;ed; but &longs;uch was the force of habit
and the influence of pre&longs;ent convenience, that I
u&longs;ed this method of arre&longs;ting his progre&longs;s and leading
him back to the hou&longs;e, with his errand, whatever
it was, unperformed. I had often caught parts,
from my &longs;tation below, of your conver&longs;ation in
this place, and was well acquainted with the voice
of your &longs;i&longs;ter.
“Some weeks after this I was again quietly seated
in this rece&longs;s. The latene&longs;s of the hour &longs;ecured
me, as I thought, from all interruption. In this,
however, I was mi&longs;taken, for Wieland and Pleyel,
as I judged by their voices, earne&longs;t in di&longs;pute, ascended
the hill.
“I was not &longs;en&longs;ible that any inconvenience could
po&longs;&longs;ibly have flowed from my former exertion; yet
it was followed with compunction, becau&longs;e it was
a deviation from a path which I had a&longs;&longs;igned to
my&longs;elf. Now my aver&longs;ion to this means of e&longs;cape
was enforced by an unauthorized curio&longs;ity, and by
the knowledge of a bu&longs;hy hollow on the edge of
the hill, where I &longs;hould be &longs;afe from di&longs;covery.
Into this hollow I thru&longs;t my&longs;elf.
“The propriety of removal to Europe was the
que&longs;tion eagerly di&longs;cu&longs;&longs;ed. Pleyel intimated that
his anxiety to go was augmented by the &longs;ilence of
There&longs;a de Stolberg. The temptation to interfere
in this di&longs;pute was irre&longs;i&longs;tible. In vain I contended
with inveterate habits. I di&longs;gui&longs;ed to my&longs;elf the
impropriety of my conduct, by recollecting the
benefits which it might produce. Pleyel's propo&longs;al
was unwi&longs;e, yet it was enforced with plau&longs;ible arguments
and indefatigable zeal. Your brother
might be puzzled and wearied, but could not be convinced.
I conceived that to terminate the





controversy in favor of the latter was conferring a benefit
on all parties. For this end I profited by an opening
in the conver&longs;ation, and a&longs;&longs;ured them of Catharine's
irreconcilable aver&longs;ion to the &longs;cheme, and
of the death of the Saxon barone&longs;s. The latter
event was merely a conjecture, but rendered extremely
probable by Pleyel's repre&longs;entations. My
purpo&longs;e, you need not be told, was effected.
“My pa&longs;&longs;ion for my&longs;tery, and a &longs;pecies of imposture,
which I deemed harmle&longs;s, was thus awakened
afre&longs;h. This &longs;econd lap&longs;e into error made
my recovery more difficult. I cannot convey to
you an adequate idea of the kind of gratification
which I derived from the&longs;e exploits; yet I meditated
nothing. My views were bounded to the pa&longs;&longs;ing
moment, and commonly &longs;ugge&longs;ted by the momentary
exigence.
“I mu&longs;t not conceal any thing. Your principles
teach you to abhor a voluptuous temper; but,
with whatever reluctance, I acknowledge this temper
to be mine. You imagine your &longs;ervant Judith
to be innocent as well as beautiful; but you took
her from a family where hypocri&longs;y, as well as licentiousness,
was wrought into a &longs;y&longs;tem. My attention
was captivated by her charms, and her principles
were ea&longs;ily &longs;een to be flexible.
“Deem me not capable of the iniquity of seduction.
Your &longs;ervant is not de&longs;titute of feminine and
virtuous qualities; but &longs;he was taught that the be&longs;t
u&longs;e of her charms con&longs;i&longs;ts in the &longs;ale of them. My
nocturnal vi&longs;its to Mettingen were now prompted
by a double view, and my corre&longs;pondence with
your &longs;ervant gave me, at all times, acce&longs;s to your
hou&longs;e.
“The &longs;econd night after our interview, &longs;o brief
and &longs;o little fore&longs;een by either of us, &longs;ome dæmon




of mi&longs;chief &longs;eized me. According to my companion's
report, your perfections were little le&longs;s than
divine. Her uncouth but copious narratives converted
you into an object of wor&longs;hip. She chiefly
dwelt upon your courage, becau&longs;e &longs;he her&longs;elf was
deficient in that quality. You held apparitions and
goblins in contempt. You took no precautions
again&longs;t robbers. You were ju&longs;t as tranquil and
&longs;ecure in this lonely dwelling, as if you were in the
mid&longs;t of a crowd.
“Hence a vague project occurred to me, to put
this courage to the te&longs;t. A woman capable of
recollection in danger, of warding off groundle&longs;s
panics, of di&longs;cerning the true mode of proceeding,
and profiting by her be&longs;t re&longs;ources, is a prodigy.
I was de&longs;irous of a&longs;certaining whether you were
&longs;uch an one.
“My expedient was obvious and &longs;imple: I was
to counterfeit a murderous dialogue; but this was
to be &longs;o conducted that another, and not your&longs;elf,
&longs;hould appear to be the object. I was not aware
of the po&longs;&longs;ibility that you &longs;hould appropriate the&longs;e
menaces to your&longs;elf. Had you been &longs;till and listened,
you would have heard the &longs;truggles and
prayers of the victim, who would likewi&longs;e have
appeared to be &longs;hut up in the clo&longs;et, and who&longs;e
voice would have been Judith's. This &longs;cene would
have been an appeal to your compa&longs;&longs;ion; and the
proof of cowardice or courage which I expected
from you, would have been your remaining inactive
in your bed, or your entering the clo&longs;et with
a view to a&longs;&longs;i&longs;t the &longs;ufferer. Some in&longs;tances which
Judith related of your fearle&longs;ne&longs;s and promptitude
made me adopt the latter &longs;uppo&longs;ition with &longs;ome degree
of confidence.
“By the girl's direction I found a ladder, and




mounted to your clo&longs;et window. This is &longs;carcely
large enough to admit the head, but it an&longs;wered
my purpo&longs;e too well.
“I cannot expre&longs;s my confu&longs;ion and &longs;urprize at
your abrupt and precipitate flight. I ha&longs;tily removed
the ladder; and, after &longs;ome pau&longs;e, curio&longs;ity
and doubts of your &longs;afety induced me to follow you.
I found you &longs;tretched on the turf before your brother's
door, without &longs;en&longs;e or motion. I felt the
deepe&longs;t regret at this unlooked-for con&longs;equence of
my &longs;cheme. I knew not what to do to procure
you relief. The idea of awakening the family naturally
pre&longs;ented it&longs;elf. This emergency was critical,
and there was no time to deliberate. It was
a &longs;udden thought that occurred. I put my lips to
the key-hole, and founded an alarm which effectually
rou&longs;ed the &longs;leepers. My organs were naturally
forcible, and had been improved by long and
affiduous exerci&longs;e.
“Long and bitterly did I repent of my &longs;cheme.
I was &longs;omewhat con&longs;oled by reflecting that my purpose
had not been evil, and renewed my fruitle&longs;s
vows never to attempt &longs;uch dangerous experiments.
For &longs;ome time I adhered, with laudable forbearance,
to this re&longs;olution.
“My life has been a life of hard&longs;hip and exposure.
In the &longs;ummer I prefer to make my bed of
the &longs;mooth turf, or, at mo&longs;t, the &longs;helter of a summer-house
&longs;uffices. In all my rambles I never
found a &longs;pot in which &longs;o many picture&longs;que beauties
and rural delights were a&longs;&longs;embled as at Mettingen.
No corner of your little domain unites fragrance
and &longs;ecrecy in &longs;o perfect a degree as the rece&longs;s in
the bank. The odour of its leaves, the coolne&longs;s
of its &longs;hade, and the mu&longs;ic of its water-fall, had
early attracted my attention. Here my &longs;adne&longs;s was




converted into peaceful melancholy—here my
&longs;lumbers were &longs;ound, and my plea&longs;ures enhanced.
“As mo&longs;t free from interruption, I cho&longs;e this as
the &longs;cene of my midnight interviews with Judith.
One evening, as the &longs;un declined, I was &longs;eated
here, when I was alarmed by your approach. It
was with difficulty that I effected my e&longs;cape unnoticed
by you.
“At the cu&longs;tomary hour, I returned to your
habitation, and was made acquainted by Judith,
with your unu&longs;ual ab&longs;ence. I half &longs;u&longs;pected the
true cau&longs;e, and felt unea&longs;ine&longs;s at the danger there
was that I &longs;hould be deprived of my retreat; or, at
lea&longs;t, interrupted in the po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;ion of it. The girl,
likewi&longs;e, informed me, that among your other singularities,
it was not uncommon for you to leave
your bed, and walk forth for the &longs;ake of night-airs
and &longs;tarlight contemplations.
“I de&longs;ired to prevent this inconvenience. I found
you ea&longs;ily &longs;wayed by fear. I was influenced, in
my choice of means, by the facility and certainty
of that to which I had been accu&longs;tomed. All that
I for&longs;aw was, that, in future, this &longs;pot would be
cautiou&longs;ly &longs;hunned by you.
“I entered the rece&longs;s with the utmo&longs;t caution,
and di&longs;covered, by your breathings, in what condition
you were. The unexpected interpretation
which you placed upon my former proceeding, suggested
my conduct on the pre&longs;ent occa&longs;ion. The
mode in which heaven is &longs;aid by the poet, to interfere
for the prevention of crimes,* was &longs;omewhat
analogous to my province, and never failed to occur
to me at &longs;ea&longs;ons like this. It was requi&longs;ite to break




your &longs;lumbers, and for this end I uttered the powerful
mono&longs;yllable, “hold! hold!” My purpo&longs;e was
not pre&longs;cribed by duty, yet &longs;urely it was far from
being atrocious and inexpiable. To effect it, I
uttered what was fal&longs;e, but it was well &longs;uited to my
purpo&longs;e. Nothing le&longs;s was intended than to injure
you. Nay, the evil re&longs;ulting from my former act,
was partly removed by a&longs;&longs;uring you that in all
places but this you were &longs;afe.
