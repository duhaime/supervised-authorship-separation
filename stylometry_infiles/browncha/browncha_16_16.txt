Here was wrought a &longs;urprizing change in my
friend. What was it that had &longs;haken conviction
&longs;o firm? Had any thing occurred during my fit,
adequate to produce &longs;o total an alteration? My
attendants informed me that he had not left my
apartment; that the unu&longs;ual duration of my fit, and
the failure, for a time, of all the means u&longs;ed for my
recovery, had filled him with grief and di&longs;may. Did
he regard the effect which his reproaches had produced
as a proof of my &longs;incerity?
In this &longs;tate of mind, I little regarded my languors
of body. I ro&longs;e and reque&longs;ted an interview with
him before my departure, on which I was re&longs;olved,
notwith&longs;tanding his earne&longs;t &longs;olicitation to &longs;pend the
night at his hou&longs;e. He complied with my reque&longs;t.
The tenderne&longs;s which he had lately betrayed, had
now di&longs;appeared, and he once more relap&longs;ed into a
chilling &longs;olemnity.
I told him that I was preparing to return to my
brother's; that I had come hither to vindicate my
innocence from the foul a&longs;per&longs;ions which he had
ca&longs;t upon it. My pride had not taken refuge in
&longs;ilence or di&longs;tance. I had not relied upon time, or
the &longs;ugge&longs;tions of his cooler thoughts, to consute his
charges. Con&longs;cious as I was that I was perfectly
guiltle&longs;s, and entertaining &longs;ome value for his good
opinion, I could not prevail upon my&longs;elf to believe
that my efforts to make my innocence manifest,
would be fruitle&longs;s. Adver&longs;e appearances might




be numerous and &longs;pecious, but they were unquestionably
fal&longs;e. I was willing to believe him sincere,
that he made no charges which he him&longs;elf
did not believe; but the&longs;e charges were de&longs;titute of
truth. The grounds of his opinion were fallacious;
and I de&longs;ired an opportunity of detecting their fallacy.
I entreated him to be explicit, and to give
me a detail of what he had heard, and what he had
&longs;een.
At the&longs;e words, my companion's countenance
grew darker. He appeared to be &longs;truggling with
his rage. He opened his lips to &longs;peak, but his accents
died away ere they were formed. This conflict
la&longs;ted for &longs;ome minutes, but his fortitude was
finally &longs;ucce&longs;sful. He &longs;poke as follows:
“I would fain put an end to this hateful &longs;cene:
what I &longs;hall &longs;ay, will be breath idly and unprofitably
con&longs;umed. The cleare&longs;t narrative will add
nothing to your pre&longs;ent knowledge. You are acquainted
with the grounds of my opinion, and yet
you avow your&longs;elf innocent: Why then &longs;hould I
rehear&longs;e the&longs;e grounds? You are apprized of the
character of Carwin: Why then &longs;hould I enumerate
the di&longs;coveries which I have made re&longs;pecting
him? Yet, &longs;ince it is your reque&longs;t; &longs;ince, considering
the limitedne&longs;s of human faculties, &longs;ome error
may po&longs;&longs;ibly lurk in tho&longs;e appearances which I
have witne&longs;&longs;ed, I will briefly relate what I know.
“Need I dwell upon the impre&longs;&longs;ions which your
conver&longs;ation and deportment originally made upon
me? We parted in childhood; but our intercour&longs;e,
by letter, was copious and uninterrupted. How
fondly did I anticipate a meeting with one whom
her letters had previou&longs;ly taught me to con&longs;ider as
the fir&longs;t of women, and how fully realized were
the expectations that I had formed!






“Here, &longs;aid I, is a being, after whom &longs;ages
may model their tran&longs;cendent intelligence, and
painters, their ideal beauty. Here is exemplified,
that union between intellect and form, which has
hitherto exi&longs;ted only in the conceptions of the poet.
I have watched your eyes; my attention has hung
upon your lips. I have que&longs;tioned whether the
enchantments of your voice were more con&longs;picuous
in the intricacies of melody, or the empha&longs;is of
rhetoric. I have marked the tran&longs;itions of your
di&longs;cour&longs;e, the felicities of your expre&longs;&longs;ion, your
refined argumentation, and glowing imagery; and
been forced to acknowledge, that all delights were
meagre and contemptible, compared with tho&longs;e connected
with the audience and &longs;ight of you. I have
contemplated your principles, and been a&longs;toni&longs;hed at
the &longs;olidity of their foundation, and the perfection
of their &longs;tructure. I have traced you to your home.
I have viewed you in relation to your &longs;ervants, to
your family, to your neighbours, and to the world.
I have &longs;een by what &longs;kilful arrangements you facilitate
the performance of the mo&longs;t arduous and complicated
duties; what daily acce&longs;&longs;ions of &longs;trength
your judicious di&longs;cipline be&longs;towed upon your memory;
what correctne&longs;s and abundance of knowledge
was daily experienced by your unwearied application
to books, and to writing. If &longs;he that
po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;es &longs;o much in the bloom of youth, will go
on accumulating her &longs;tores, what, &longs;aid I, is the
picture &longs;he will di&longs;play at a mature age?
“You know not the accuracy of my ob&longs;ervation.
I was de&longs;irous that others &longs;hould profit by an example
&longs;o rare. I therefore noted down, in writing,
every particular of your conduct. I was anxious
to benefit by an opportunity &longs;o &longs;eldom afforded us.
I laboured not to omit the &longs;lighte&longs;t &longs;hade, or the





mo&longs;t petty line in your portrait. Here there was
no other ta&longs;k incumbent on me but to copy; there
was no need to exaggerate or overlook, in order
to produce a more unexceptionable pattern. Here
was a combination of harmonies and graces, incapable
of diminution or acce&longs;lion without injury to
its completene&longs;s.
“I found no end and no bounds to my ta&longs;k. No
di&longs;play of a &longs;cene like this could be chargeable with
redundancy or &longs;uperfluity. Even the colour of a
&longs;hoe, the knot of a ribband, or your attitude in
plucking a ro&longs;e, were of moment to be recorded.
Even the arrangements of your breakfa&longs;t-table and
your toilet have been amply di&longs;played.
“I know that mankind are more ea&longs;ily enticed to
virtue by example than by precept. I know that
the ab&longs;olutene&longs;s of a model, when &longs;upplied by invention,
dimini&longs;hes its &longs;alutary influence, &longs;ince it is
u&longs;ele&longs;s, we think, to &longs;trive after that which we know
to be beyond our reach. But the picture which I
drew was not a phantom; as a model, it was devoid
of imperfection; and to a&longs;pire to that height
which had been really attained, was by no means
unrea&longs;onable. I had another and more intere&longs;ting
object in view. One exi&longs;ted who claimed all my
tenderne&longs;s. Here, in all its parts, was a model
worthy of affiduous &longs;tudy, and indefatigable imitation.
I called upon her, as &longs;he wi&longs;hed to &longs;ecure and
enhance my e&longs;teem, to mould her thoughts, her
words, her countenance, her actions, by this pattern.
“The ta&longs;k was exuberant of plea&longs;ure, and I
was deeply engaged in it, when an imp of mi&longs;chief
was let loo&longs;e in the form of Carwin. I admired his
powers and accompli&longs;hments. I did not wonder
that they were admired by you. On the rectitude
of your judgment, however, I relied to keep this




admiration within di&longs;creet and &longs;crupulous bounds.
I a&longs;&longs;ured my&longs;elf, that the &longs;trangene&longs;s of his deportment,
and the ob&longs;curity of his life, would teach you
caution. Of all errors, my knowledge of your
character informed me that this was lea&longs;t likely to
be&longs;all you.
“You were powerfully affected by his fir&longs;t appearance;
you were bewitched by his countenance
and his tones; your de&longs;cription was ardent and pathetic:
I li&longs;tened to you with &longs;ome emotions of surprize.
The portrait you drew in his ab&longs;ence, and
the inten&longs;ity with which you mu&longs;ed upon it, were
new and unexpected incidents. They be&longs;poke a
&longs;en&longs;ibility &longs;omewhat too vivid; but from which,
while &longs;ubjected to the guidance of an understanding
like yours, there was nothing to dread.
“A more direct intercour&longs;e took place between
you. I need not apologize for the &longs;olicitude which
I entertained for your &longs;afety. He that gifted me
with perception of excellence, compelled me to love
it. In the mid&longs;t of danger and pain, my contemplations
have ever been cheered by your image.
Every object in competition with you, was worthless
and trivial. No price was too great by which
your &longs;afety could be purcha&longs;ed. For that end, the
&longs;acrifice of ea&longs;e, of health, and even of life, would
cheerfully have been made by me. What wonder
then, that I &longs;crutinized the &longs;entiments and deportment
of this man with cea&longs;ele&longs;s vigilance; that I
watched your words and your looks when he was
pre&longs;ent; and that I extracted cau&longs;e for the deepe&longs;t
inquietudes, from every token which you gave of
having put your happine&longs;s into this man's keeping?
“I was cautious in deciding. I recalled the various
conver&longs;ations in which the topics of love and
marriage had been di&longs;cu&longs;&longs;ed. As a woman, young,




beautiful, and independent, it behoved you to have
fortified your mind with ju&longs;t principles on this subject.
Your principles were eminently ju&longs;t. Had
not their rectitude and their firmne&longs;s been atte&longs;ted
by your treatment of that &longs;pecious &longs;educer Dashwood?
The&longs;e principles, I was prone to believe,
exempted you from danger in this new &longs;tate of
things. I was not the la&longs;t to pay my homage to the
unrivalled capacity, in&longs;inuation, and eloquence of
this man. I have di&longs;gui&longs;ed, but could never &longs;tifle
the conviction, that his eyes and voice had a witchcraft
in them, which rendered him truly formidable:
but I reflected on the ambiguous expre&longs;&longs;ion of his
countenance—an ambiguity which you were the
fir&longs;t to remark; on the cloud which ob&longs;cured his
character; and on the &longs;u&longs;picious nature of that concealment
which he &longs;tudied; and concluded you to
be &longs;afe. I denied the obvious con&longs;truction to appearances.
I referred your conduct to &longs;ome principle
which had not been hitherto di&longs;clo&longs;ed, but
which was reconcileable with tho&longs;e already known.
“I was not &longs;uffered to remain long in this suspence.
One evening, you may recollect, I came
to your hou&longs;e, where it was my purpo&longs;e, as u&longs;ual,
to lodge, &longs;omewhat earlier than ordinary. I &longs;pied
a light in your chamber as I approached from the
out&longs;ide, and on inquiring of Judith, was informed
that you were writing. As your kin&longs;man and
friend, and fellow-lodger, I thought I had a right to
be familiar. You were in your chamber, but your
employment and the time were &longs;uch as to make it
no infraction of decorum to follow you thither.
The &longs;pirit of mi&longs;chievous gaiety po&longs;&longs;e&longs;&longs;ed me. I
proceeded on tiptoe. You did not perceive my entrance;
and I advanced &longs;oftly till I was able to
overlook your &longs;houlder.






“I had gone thus far in error, and had no power
to recede. How cautiou&longs;ly &longs;hould we guard again&longs;t
the fir&longs;t inroads of temptation! I knew that to pry
into your papers was criminal; but I reflected that
no &longs;entiment of yours was of a nature which made
it your intere&longs;t to conceal it. You wrote much
more than you permitted your friends to peru&longs;e.
My curio&longs;ity was &longs;trong, and I had only to throw
a glance upon the paper, to &longs;ecure its gratification.
I &longs;hould never have deliberately committed an act
like this. The &longs;lighte&longs;t ob&longs;tacle would have repelled
me; but my eye glanced almo&longs;t spontaneously
upon the paper. I caught only parts of sentences;
but my eyes comprehended more at a glance,
becau&longs;e the characters were &longs;hort-hand. I lighted
on the words &longs;ummer-hou&longs;e, midnight, and made
out a pa&longs;&longs;age which &longs;poke of the propriety and of
the effects to be expected from another interview.
All this pa&longs;&longs;ed in le&longs;s than a moment. I then
checked my&longs;elf, and made my&longs;elf known to you,
by a tap upon your &longs;houlder.
“I could pardon and account for &longs;ome trifling
alarm; but your trepidation and blu&longs;hes were excessive.
You hurried the paper out of &longs;ight, and
&longs;eemed too anxious to di&longs;cover whether I knew the
contents to allow your&longs;elf to make any inquiries. I
wondered at the&longs;e appearances of con&longs;ternation, but
did not rea&longs;on on them until I had retired. When
alone, the&longs;e incidents &longs;ugge&longs;ted them&longs;elves to my
reflections a new.
“To what &longs;cene, or what interview, I a&longs;ked,
did you allude? Your di&longs;appearance on a former
evening, my tracing you to the rece&longs;s in the bank,
your &longs;ilence on my fir&longs;t and &longs;econd call, your vague
an&longs;wers and invincible embarra&longs;&longs;ment, when you,
at length, a&longs;cended the hill, I recollected with new




&longs;urprize. Could this be the &longs;ummer-hou&longs;e alluded
to? A certain timidity and con&longs;ciou&longs;ne&longs;s had generally
attended you, when this incident and this recess
had been the &longs;ubjects of conver&longs;ation. Nay,
I imagined that the la&longs;t time that adventure was
mentioned, which happened in the pre&longs;ence of Carwin,
the countenance of the latter betrayed &longs;ome
emotion. Could the interview have been with
him?
“This was an idea calculated to rou&longs;e every
faculty to contemplation. An interview at that
hour, in this dark&longs;ome retreat, with a man of this
my&longs;terious but formidable character; a clande&longs;tine
interview, and one which you afterwards endeavoured
with &longs;o much &longs;olicitude to conceal! It was
a fearful and portentous occurrence. I could not
mea&longs;ure his power, or fathom his de&longs;igns. Had he
rifled from you the &longs;ecret of your love, and reconciled
you to concealment and nocturnal meetings?
I &longs;carcely ever &longs;pent a night of more inquietude.
“I knew not how to act. The a&longs;certainment
of this man's character and views &longs;eemed to be,
in the fir&longs;t place, nece&longs;&longs;ary. Had he openly preferred
his &longs;uit to you, we &longs;hould have been impowered
to make direct inquiries; but &longs;ince he had
cho&longs;en this ob&longs;cure path, it &longs;eemed rea&longs;onable to
infer that his character was exceptionable. It, at
lea&longs;t, &longs;ubjected us to the nece&longs;&longs;ity of re&longs;orting to
other means of information. Yet the improbability
that you &longs;hould commit a deed of &longs;uch rashness,
made me reflect anew upon the in&longs;ufficiency
of tho&longs;e grounds on which my &longs;u&longs;picions had been
built, and almo&longs;t to condemn my&longs;elf for harbouring
them.
“Though it was mere conjecture that the interview
&longs;poken of had taken place with Carwin,




yet two ideas occurred to involve me in the mo&longs;t
painful doubts. This man's rea&longs;onings might be &longs;o
&longs;pecious, and his artifices &longs;o profound, that, aided
by the pa&longs;&longs;ion which you had conceived for him, he
had finally &longs;ucceeded; or his &longs;ituation might be &longs;uch
as to ju&longs;tify the &longs;ecrecy which you maintained. In
neither ca&longs;e did my wilde&longs;t reveries &longs;ugge&longs;t to me,
that your honor had been forfeited.
“I could not talk with you on this &longs;ubject. If
the imputation was fal&longs;e, its atrociou&longs;ne&longs;s would
have ju&longs;tly drawn upon me your re&longs;entment, and I
mu&longs;t have explained by what facts it had been suggested.
If it were true, no benefit would follow
from the mention of it. You had cho&longs;en to conceal
it for &longs;ome rea&longs;ons, and whether the&longs;e rea&longs;ons
were true or fal&longs;e, it was proper to di&longs;cover and
remove them in the fir&longs;t place. Finally, I acquiesced
in the lea&longs;t painful &longs;uppo&longs;ition, trammelled as
it was with perplexities, that Carwin was upright,
and that, if the rea&longs;ons of your &longs;ilence were known
they would be found to be ju&longs;t.
