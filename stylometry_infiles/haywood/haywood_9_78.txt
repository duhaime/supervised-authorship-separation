Which, the author thinks it highly proper to acquaint the public, is much of a piece with the foregoing; so that every one may be at liberty either to read or not, according to the satisfaction the other has afforded. 
Jenny had lived almost as retired as a woman in the first month of her widowhood, ever since Jemmy had been obliged to fly the kingdom on the wound he had given Belpine; but now finding he was out of all danger, either of life or liberty, on that score, by the recovery of his antagonist, and also that he was gone to regale himself in a place so abounding with all sorts of pleasures, she began to resume her former chearfulness and vivacity, appeared in all public places as she had been accustom'd, and return'd all the visits that were made to her. 
Her intimacy with lady Speck and miss Wingman was very much increased since she had been at Bath with them, by the participation they had in her 
secrets, and she in theirs:—as these ladies were continually entertain'd by their lovers with all manner of diversions, she was never left out in any of them, except by her own choice. 
Though no one was fonder of all innocent pleasures, and was less reserv'd and unconstrain'd in conversation, yet she did not suffer the gaities of life to interfere with her more serious reflections;—the duties of love and friendship, next those of Heaven, were always her peculiar care, and she never neglected the discharge of them on any pretence whatever. 
It cannot therefore be supposed that she omitted the gratification of her dear Jemmy's request;—she calculated, as well as she was able from the accounts had been given her of the route to Paris, on what day he would be there, and sent a letter to meet him on his arrival;—the contents of what she wrote to him were these: 

To James Jessamy, Esq;
“My dear Jemmy
I hope this will find you in good health and spirits, after the fatigue of your long journey;—I am so well 
pleased with your having taken it, that I should extremely condemn myself for not having advised you to it sooner, if what I confess was owing to my want of thought, had not proved for the best, by occasioning you to go in such good company. 
“I am told that Belpine is judg'd to be out of danger;—but that is now a matter of no moment,—whatever may be wrote to you on that head, remember, that as I may never see Paris myself I shall expect from you a very exact account of all the curiosities the place affords;—therefore, if you would oblige me, you must not think of coming home till you are well assured that you can have left nothing behind you unobserv'd. 
“Good night,—repose, at present, must be more beneficial to you than any thing I could say, which would all amount to no more than a repetition of my being, 
“With the most unfeigned affection,
My dear Jemmy,
As much yours at this distance
As when nearer,
J. Jessamy. 
“P. S. Pray let sir Robert know I think of him with the most just respect.” 

Tho' this letter was somewhat shorter than those she usually wrote to him, yet the few lines it contain'd discovered, without her designing to do so, such a well establish'd fund of tenderness in her soul, as cannot but be discernable to every understanding reader. 
She was entirely eased of all her apprehensions for him on the score of the wound he had given Belpine, and doubtless wish'd as ardently to see him again as the most violent of her sex could have done; but there was a certain delicacy in her passion, which render'd every thing that gave him pleasure an adequate satisfaction to herself, nor could she ever have been truly happy without knowing he was so. 
Besides, she consider'd that for him to leave such a place as Paris immediately, and without being able, at his return, to give any description of the royal palaces,—colleges,—convents, and other things she had heard much talk of, must infallibly expose him to the raillery of all his 
acquaintance,—she knew that they would say it was for her sake he did so;—that they would call him a romantic lover;—tell him that he was so much the devotee of Cupid, that he could not support the least absence from his mistress; with such like stuff;—and would have chose he should even love her less, rather than that he should give any proofs of love which might call in question his good sense. 
How easy,—how contented must be the man who has a mistress of this way of thinking! and how happy is it also for herself, as it is the almost certain means of securing the lasting esteem, as well as affection, of the man she loves? 
Jemmy, at least, was a proof of the truth of this observation;—the gay and sprightly manner in which he answer'd his dear Jenny's epistle, shew'd he was highly pleased with the injunction she laid upon him in it;—these were his words: 


To miss Jessamy.
“Dearest Jenny,
I Received yours two hours after my arrival,—I need not tell you with what pleasure;—but because I have no words to thank the kindness of it as I ought, nor any thing more material to fill up my letter, shall give you a brief recital of our journey, in which we met with something drole enough to make you laugh, if I do not spoil it in the description. 
“We had not been long in the first inn we baited at, when the drawer told us there was an English gentleman in the house, who hearing we were his countrymen begg'd leave to join us;—this we readily granted, flattering ourselves that the evening would pass more agreeably by the addition of a third person in company;—a young spark was presently usher'd in, dress'd fitter for the drawing-room than the road;—after the first compliments were over, he cried out in a very theatric tone, 
Thro' Purgatory first we pass,
And then arrive at Heaven's high Mass.

“We stared at him, but he immediately explained himself, and told us in plain prose, that after the purgatory of an odious sea-sickness, and the villainous jolt of a post-chaise, he had at last attain'd the heaven of being admitted into the company of persons whom he knew, by their equipage, must be men of good sense and taste. 
“We found him very communicative;—he had not been half an hour before he gave us the history of his life; but so larded with scraps of poetry and tags of plays, that it was not altogether intelligible; we pick'd out enough, however, to know that he had been intended for the law; but that not liking the business, nor indeed any business, he had left his master before he had served out half his clerkship; and unexpectedly coming into the possession of an estate, by the death of a relation, he applied himself to the study of the Belles Lettres, meaning poetry,—in which he imagin'd himself a great proficient:—he told us that he had read every thing worth reading in English, and was now come to France to perfect himself in that language, for the better understanding of Racine, Crebillion, 
and some other authors whom he had heard much talk'd on. 
“I have known some men, who either having no genius of their own, or are too indolent to exert it, have thus set up both for wits and critics upon the shoulders of others; but I never found one so strongly possess'd with this poetical frenzy as the fellow I am telling of. 
“Sir Robert in a sarcastical humour, wrote his character extempore in these lines, which I find no fault with, but that they are not half severe enough: 
Sure he was born when nature was in chime,
Whate'er you say, he answers still in rhyme;
Knows all the bards,—from Shakespear's lofty flow,
Down to the jingle of time-serving Row,
And Fielding's Rosamond in puppet-show;
Has all fam'd Laureat Colley's Odes by heart,
Can point out what is dull, and what is smart;
Erects himself a wit, on their foundation,
And proves his arguments from sound quotation;
Memory supplies judgment and fancy's want,
You miss not these, while that's predominant.
“In fine, my dear Jenny, there never was a more egregious coxcomb; but the poor creature was diverting, and complaisant to such an excess, that it was not in our power to affront him:—we had him with us quite up to Paris, and perhaps should not have got rid of him here very easily, if it had not come into sir Robert's head to recommend him to a coffee-house, where he told him he would find a great many petit-maitres, much of his own turn of mind. 
“This is the only adventure that happen'd to us on the road, except an instance of puritanical hypocrisy, which may serve to strengthen that contempt I know you already have for those pretended zealots:—happening to stop at a cabaret on the road for some refreshment, another post-chaise came to the door at the same time, out of 
which alighted one of the most noted and most impudent courtezans that ever stroll'd St. James's Park;—she was handed out by a person in laced cloaths, bag wig, feather in his hat, and a long sword by his side; but the conventicle leer distinguish'd him thro' this disguise, and I presently knew him for a wealthy citizen of London,—a strong Presbyterian,—and who passes for a saint among his congregation;—as I had some little acquaintance with him, having once bought some things of him, I stepp'd towards him,—call'd him by his name, and told him I was surprised to see him in France;—never was poor mortal so confused,—so shock'd;—at first, I believe, he would have denied he was the person; but not having courage, he begg'd I would not expose him, by telling any body where, or in what company I had seen him;—I promised I would not, and left him; but still so disconcerted, that I dare say it would be some time before he could recover himself to be good company with his mistress. 
“I leave you to laugh; for whatever tender things I have to say to you must be deferr'd till another opportunity, 
my paper affording room for no more, than that I am, 
“Eternally, truly, and passionately,
My soul's best joy,
Your most devoted
Friend, lover,
And servant,
J. Jessamy.” 
The satisfaction Jenny felt in reading this letter, as indeed in all others she received from the same hand, need not be told to those who have faithful and affectionate hearts; and to those of rougher natures would be but impertinent; I shall therefore say no more on this head, but pass on to matters of a very different kind.
