Contains a very notable instance of friendship a-la-mode. 
While our lovers were thus endeavouring to form their minds in such a manner as should enable them to render each other perfectly happy, when they should come to be united together, there were not wanting some who made it their chief study to contrive the means of separating them for ever. 
Jemmy had contracted a very numerous acquaintance since his father's death, many of whom had a large share of his esteem and friendship; but there was one above the rest whose humour and behaviour he was particularly taken with, and with whom he conversed with the most unreserved freedom. 
This gentleman, who was called Bellpine, was descended from a very ancient family, and had been, through the extravagance and ill management of his father, deprived of all that ought to have been his patrimony, except two hundred pounds a year, which had been settled upon his mother by way of jointure, and could not be dissipated. 
He had, notwithstanding, been flatter'd with the expectation of being one day in possession of an estate of near three thousand pounds per annum, being the undoubted heir of an uncle, who having lived a batchelor till a very advanced age, there was not the least probability of his ever changing his condition, and much less of his having any children, even in case such a thing should happen; and this dependance it was that hindred him from being bred up to any business or profession, and also gave him an air of self-sufficiency, in some measure conformable to the fortune he so reasonably hoped to become master of. 
This uncle, however, to the extreme surprise of all that knew him, at the age of eighty-two, and equally laden with infirmities and years, took it into his head to marry a daughter of one of his tenants in the country,—a girl scarce nineteen. 
An accident such as this, could not, when it happen'd, but give a very great shock to Bellpine, as he could not assure himself but that, in spite of his uncle's great age, a child, some way or other, might come, and cut him off at once from the inheritance he had been made to depend upon; yet did he not suffer his spirits to sink on this occasion, he rather exerted them all, in order to find some means to remedy, or, at least, to abate the asperity of this disappointment; the most feasible ones, he thought, would be to procure, if possible, some genteel employment about court, and, at the same time, make his addresses to some lady of an handsome fortune for a wife. 
He was solliciting at the levees of the great for the accomplishment of his first project; and casting about in his mind where he should direct his courtship with the most probability of succeeding in the other, when he commenced an acquaintance with Jemmy; chance brought them at first together, and a mutual liking of each other's conversation, by degrees, grew up to that intamacy between them already mention'd. 
Jemmy was of the most open communicative disposition that man could possibly be; he had very few affairs in life which he made secrets of to any of those whom he call'd his friends; but with Bellpine he maintain'd no reserve he made him the confidant of all his looser pleasures, his foibles, his very thoughts were not conceal'd from him; it therefore may be supposed that he disguis'd not the honourable affection he had for Jenny, the care that both their parents had taken to bring them up in notions of being united together when they arrived at years of maturity, and also the reasons urg'd on her side, and agreed to on his, for delaying, for some time, the celebration of their nuptials. 
As his heart was warm with a passion, which duty and the custom of looking on her as the person ordain'd for his wife, had at first inspired him with, and a just sensibility of the many amiable qualities she was mistress of, had afterwards greatly heighten'd in him, he spoke of her in a manner sufficient to inflame the heart of the hearer with envy at his happiness; in this, indeed, it must be confess'd that he shew'd more sincerity than prudence; but as one of our poets observes, 
Those free from guile themselves, can scarce believe,
That others will be false.
Nor was this all; he contented not himself with giving him a bear idea of what she was, he introduced him to her acquaintance, he frequently made him a partner in his visits to her, recommended him as a person highly worthy of her esteem and friendship; and, in fine, spoke of him in terms which obliged her to treat him as such; little, alas, suspecting that while doing this he was whetting the edge of a sword that might one day be pointed against his own bosom. 
Bellpine was far from being the man the honest heart of Jemmy mistook him for; he was possess'd, it is true, of many accomplishments both natural and acquired; but had no fund either of honour or generosity; he knew perfectly well how to insinuate himself into the good graces of those he convers'd with; but thought himself not bound to make an adequate return for any favours he received from them; all his wishes were center'd in self-gratification, and no consideration for others had ever any weight to make him desist that favourite pursuit. 
Being of a disposition such as I have described, it is not to be wonder'd at that the fine person and large fortune of Jenny should make him envy the happiness of him who was to be the possessor of that double treasure; he lov'd her on the score of her beauty, her wit, and the many amiable qualities he had observed in her; but adored her as being the mistress of what he so much wanted; and fill'd with the idea of those advantages he might reap in an alliance with her, made him resolve on the attempt, and to take all the methods his inventive fancy could inspire to alienate her affections from his friend. 
He had often heard Jemmy say, that the agreement between them for protracting the celebration of their marriage had been first proposed by her; from whence he concluded, that the passion she had for him was not so violent but that it might be easily withdrawn, if she was once made to believe there was a decay in that he profess'd for her. 
He was sensible, notwithstanding, that there required a more than common share of caution and address in the management of this design; he saw very well, that Jenny had a great deal of sagacity, and penetration; it behoved him therefore, either to throw such a temptation in Jemmy's way as should render him in effect ungrateful and perfidious, or contrive such appearances of his being so, as could not be discover'd from reality by any human wit. 
With the first of these measures he commenc'd the prosecution of his design, though of the two the least feasible to be accomplish'd, as it was very difficult to find a woman who excell'd Jenny in any one perfection, that can attract the eye, or captivate the heart; ‘Love, said he within himself, is seldom so much the effect of reason as of fancy, and if I can be so lucky as to present an object capable of firing the heart of this too happy rival with an amorous flame, and she has virtue or cunning enough to refuse the gratification on any other terms than those of marriage, it may so happen, that all the merits of Jenny, and his engagements with her, will be too light to over-balance inclination.’ 
He knew that Jemmy was extremely fond of music; he had seen him in the utmost raptures on hearing a melodious voice, or an instrument finely play'd upon; and it was by this bait he hoped to allure Jemmy from his vows; or, at least, to draw him into such a manner of behaviour as should picque the pride of Jenny, and render her indifferent towards him. 
To dissolve the cement of that tender affection, with which they now regarded each other, would go a great way towards gaining the point he aim'd at; he flatter'd himself, that if he could once set them at variance, he was at present enough in Jenny's favour to be able to obtain the first share in her tenderness, when taken off from the man who now engross'd it. 
The person, whose charms he intended as the snare to entrap the constancy of Jemmy, was call'd miss Chit; she pass'd, in the opinion of most people, for the daughter of a gentleman distinguished in the world for nothing so much as for being her father; but it was whisper'd, by those who pretended to be conniossieurs in the secret intrigues of the great, that she really sprung from parents of a much more elevated station. 
She was young, handsome, well shaped, and though of somewhat too diminutive a stature, had an air and mien extremely strieking; she wanted neither wit nor assurance to set off the talents she was mistress of to the best advantage; she was a great courtier, and perfectly skill'd in all the rudiments of modish good breding; but the chief inducement that Bellpine had to make choice of her as the instrument of his purpose was this; nature had given her a voice that seem'd the very soul of harmony, and when accompanied by her harpsichord, which she finely touch'd, the mellifluous sounds had power to calm the most raging passions of the mind, and convert all into love and soft desire; so that what the poet says of Mira might be justly enough ascrib'd to her, 
The wretch, who from her wit and beauty flies,
If she but reach him with her voice, he dies.
Bellpine frequently visited this lady, and was welcome to her on account of his facetious conversation, and the intelligence he pick'd up among his acquaintance, and was continually bringing her of the intrigues of the town. As he was well received by her, he could not fail of being so by her father, who, it was easy to perceive, was but the second person in the family; standing as he did with both, it cannot be supposed he wanted interest to introduce any one he thought proper to her acquaintance. 
He would not, however, proceed too abruptly in the affair, as it might have spoil'd all, if either party had suspected him of design; but watch'd an opportunity, when they were talking one day of music, to ask Jemmy, in a careless manner, as it were by chance, if he had ever heard miss Chit sing and play? 
‘No, reply'd he, but I have heard she does both to very great perfection.’ ‘I wonder, said the other, that you should not have the curiosity to be judge of her skill that way yourself, as you are so great a lover of music!’ 
‘I have not the honour to be at all known to her, return'd Jemmy, nor have even ever seen her, any more than en passant, once or twice I think at court, and two or three times in the mall with lady Fisk.’ 
‘I am pretty free there, cried Bellpine, and if you have an inclination to hear this female Orpheus of the town, will take you with me, and also engage she shall give you a touch of her harmony both vocal and instrumental; for, to do her justice, she has not the least reserve in this point; her harpsichord is never out of tune, nor her voice disconcerted with a cold.’ 
Jemmy express'd a great deal of satisfaction at this offer, but gave much more than what he felt himself to his pretended friend, who look'd on the ready compliance he found in him as a happy beginning of the enterprize he had projected; so both being of the same mind, they agreed to meet at White's the next day, and then proceed on their visit to the lady.
