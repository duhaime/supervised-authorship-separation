Contains a very remarkable occurrence. 
Mr. Welby made his first visit very short; but was not suffer'd to depart without engaging himself to come again the next day and bring his lady with him, whom they were not a little impatient to see, as sir Thomas had mention'd her so handsomly in his letter. 
The daughters of lady Wingman had a sincere regard for this young gentleman, not only as he was the son of sir Thomas Welby, but also on the score of his own good qualities; and, willing to testify it by all the marks in their power, gave orders to those who had the management of their houshold affairs, to omit nothing proper for the entertainment of the new wedded pair. 
Three was the appointed hour, and had not elapsed as many minutes when their expected guest appear'd;—the bride seem'd very lovely in the eyes of lord Huntley, Jemmy, and sir Robert Manley; but there was something in her, which much more than her beauty, attracted those of mr. Lovegrove and the three ladies,—each of these was perfectly convinced that they had been acquainted with her face, though when or where none of them could recollect;—but when she spoke, in returning the salutations they severally gave her, her voice immediately eased them of the suspence they had been in, and presented her to their remembrance for the fair stranger whom accident and distress had brought into their company, at the village where they had been obliged to lie on their return from Bath. 
Great was their astonishment, nor was that of mrs. Welby less; but as they had too much politeness to betray any part of theirs, or take the least notice they had ever seen her before, so she had too much generosity not to avow her remembrance of them. 
‘It was with a great deal of pleasure I came, said mrs. Welby, to pay my respects to the friends of mr. Welby; but how infinitely would that pleasure have been enhanced, had it been possible for me to have foreseen I should have met the only persons to whom I have been so highly obliged in the extremest exigence in my life;’—then perceiving they made no other reply, as indeed they were not yet enough recover'd from their surprize to do it: —‘You may not, perhaps, resumed she, be able presently to distinguish in the wife of mr. Welby the once forlorn, the distress'd fugitive;—but this will be to me a perpetal memento of your goodness.’ 
In speaking these last words she took out of her pocket the snuff-box she had exposed to sale at the Inn, and which mr. Lovegrove had bought and return'd to her with so much gallantry;—on sight of it,—‘It will be a lasting honour to me, madam, said that gentleman, that you still retain a trifle no otherwise worthy your acceptance than by being before in your possession.’ 
The two sisters now first acknowledged their remembrance of her, with many compliments on the change of her condition; and Jenny, who had been impatient to do so, congratulated her good fortune with the extremest warmth:—those of the company who were not in the secret, were surprised at these salutations; but mr. Welby most of all, which his fair wife perceiving,—‘You have introduced me, said she, to persons whom I little hoped to have met at Paris, but would have gone much farther to have seen;—I shall at leisure make you acquainted with the obligations I have to them.’ 
Dinner being that instant serv'd up broke off all farther speech upon this head; but the ladies were all the time in the utmost impatience to know the bottom of an affair which at present seem'd so mysterious to them, and as soon as the cloth was remov'd, left the gentlemen to their Burgundy and drew mrs. Welby into another room, not doubting but she would readily satisfy their curiosity, which she accordingly did in the following manner: 



“What you desire of me, said she, is so little worthy your attention, that I shall be as brief as possible in the repetition;—you already know the catastrophe of my fate in seeing me the wife of the most generous man on earth;—as for the accidents that made me so, they will only serve to shew that when we think ourselves farthest remov'd from happiness we are often nearest to it. 
“You may remember, ladies, that I told you my design was to cross the sea from Bristol to Cork;—I got safe, without the least molestation, to the end of my journey; but was fortunately prevented from embarking on my voyage by this means: 
“I had scarce time to enquire if any vessel was bound for my intended port, when that aunt to whom I was going landed from thence;—she came into the same inn where I was,—we were mutually astonish'd at the sight of each other; but I soon related to her the whole of my unlucky story, and the 
disappointment it was to me to see her come to England in the very moment I was flying for refuge to her in Ireland, at which she seem'd equally surprised and troubled. 
“At first she highly blam'd me for resisting so foolishly my good fortune, as she term'd it; but, perceiving I burst into tears at her reproaches, became more gentle:—she told me, however, that it would be quite improper for me to go to her house while she was out of it, as my uncle had never seen me, and I was an entire stranger to every one in the family;” —‘But, said she, you shall go back to London with me,—I shall see your father soon after I come there,—will talk to him concerning you, and doubt not but I shall be able to mitigate matters between you, so as you may go home again without being forced to marry against your inclinations.’ 
“This did not very well please me, as I knew my father's positive temper, and fear'd the success of her negotiation in this point; however, as I had no other course to take, I was oblig'd to submit to her directions, and the 
next day we set out together in the stage-coach for London. 
“On our arrival we were lodg'd at the house of an eminent banker in the city, who had before been appris'd of my aunt's coming by letters for that purpose:—she told him nothing more of me than that I was her niece, nor did he think it his business to ask any questions, but treated me with a great deal of civility and respect; and, as I was a perfect stranger in that part of the town, I thought myself as secure there as if I had been in Ireland. 
“The next day my aunt went to visit my father; but he happen'd to be gone out of town for a few days, and she found only my sister, who, on her making some enquiry for me, told her—that I was an impudent slut,—that after having promised to marry a gentleman of great worth and fortune, and every thing being prepared for the ceremony, I had run away in a most scandalous manner on the very day it was to have been perform'd;—that nobody knew what was become of me;—that I had almost broke my father's heart, and was a disgrace to all that belong'd to me. 
“As I knew the bitterness of my sister's nature, and the small portion of good-will she always had for me, I was not at all surpriz'd when my aunt return'd with this intelligence;—I was only sorry my father was not at home, that I might have known in what manner he resented my behaviour; for as I had never failed in the dutious love of a child to a parent, the thoughts of having been compell'd to incur his displeasure gave me the most severe affliction and remorse. 
“While I was in this suspence an accident befel me, which, tho' I thought little of at that time, proved afterwards to be of the greatest importance of my whole life. 
“My aunt was gone one day to her lawyer, on the business which had brought her to England,—I was sitting reading at a window, when a servant at the banker's shew'd a gentleman into the room, and desir'd him to sit down, saying he expected his master home in a few minutes;—I rose from my seat at the entrance of this stranger, but was pretty much surpriz'd when I presently recollected 
he was the person who had follow'd me from church one Sunday to my father's door:—you may remember, ladies, continued she, that I mention'd this incident to you on account of my sister's reproaching me with it afterwards.” 

‘I remember it perfectly well, said lady Speck; and I dare answer that no part of your story was lost on any of us:—but pray proceed; for I already begin to trace the oddness of this event.’ —Mrs. Welby smil'd and went on: 
“I would have left the room, resum'd she, but an unaccountable something rivetted my feet;—the gentleman at first seem'd in more confusion than myself, but he soon recover'd from it; and seeing I had a book in my hand approach'd me, and with an air the most gay, yet respectful,’—‘May I presume, madam, said he, to ask what author is so happy as to engage your contemplations?’ 
—“I reply'd, it was only a novel, entitled, Love and Duty reconciled;—this, he has since told me, he look'd upon as a prosperous omen to his hopes;—but he had no opportunity then to say anything farther,—the banker came that instant 
in,—begg'd his pardon for having made him wait, and told him, that as they should now be too late for the office, if he would accept of a bad dinner with him they would go together in the afternoon;—the gentle very readily agreed;—while they were talking my aunt came in, and the cloth being already spread we all sat down to table. 
“My aunt was so much disconcerted that she could scarce eat, which the banker taking notice of, she burst into the most vehement exclamations against her lawyer;—the young gentleman, who by this time had found how nearly she was related to me, ask'd her many questions concerning the behaviour of the person she complain'd of, and she then gave him a long detail of particulars, which, as they are no way material to my story, I shall not trouble you with a repetition of; and shall only tell you, that she concluded with saying, that mr. Dally was one of the most base as well as most unmannerly men in the world.” 
—‘Mr. Dally, cry'd he, I know him well, my father has been long his client, and I believe is the best friend he has:—if you will permit me to wait on you to him, I 
dare almost promise to engage him to do you justice.’ —“She was quite transported at this offer and joyfully accepted it, on which he assur'd her he would come the next morning and attend her to mr. Dally's chambers; there pass'd no more, soon after dinner he went out with the banker on the business they had been talking of, which I afterwards found was to the Million Bank, where he had some money left him on the death of a relation. 
“On the banker's return my aunt could not forbear asking the name of the gentleman who had been so obliging to her, to which he reply'd, that he was the only son of sir Thomas Welby, and then ran into great encomiums both on the father and the son, tho' no more than what I have since experienced they justly merit:—I was, however, very much confounded; for I must now acquaint you, ladies, that sir Thomas Welby is the person, the history of whose liking of me I have already told you, since it was he I took so much pains to fly. 
“Here they all cry'd out in the utmost amazement, almost at the same 
time,”—‘What, madam, sir Thomas Welby, my guardian, said lady Huntley; was it to him you should have been married! 
“The same, indeed, reply'd she; nor is it strange you should be ignorant such a thing was in agitation; for even had it been effected it was to have been kept a secret from his own family till I had been carried home and set at the head of it; but I shall now proceed to the more agreeable part of my narrative;—mr. Welby came according to his promise, and usher'd my aunt to the lawyer's;—she return'd about noon in very high spirits;—told me that mr. Welby's presence, and what he said, had wrought a wonderful effect;—that the lawyer was now as civil as before he had been rude; and that her business would be dispatch'd in a very short time:” —‘But, my dear niece, said she, I have something better than all this to inform you of;—this fine young gentleman is violently in love with you;—he has made me the confidant of his passion, and engag'd my interest. —What now, pursued she, seeing me look a little grave, surely you will not withstand your fortune a second time?’ 
—“I reply'd, 
that I could see little advantage in that gentleman's affections, since it was impossible his father would ever give a sanction to it.” —‘Pish,—what then, resum'd she; when once you are married to him the father will easily be brought to forgive what cannot be recall'd.’ —“I urged the vanity of hoping a father would ever forgive a son for marrying the woman he had a mind to himself; but she made slight of all I said, and then told me, that as it was not proper the banker should as yet be let into the secret, she had promised to give mr. Welby a meeting that afternoon, and to bring me with her:” —‘Neither your pride nor modesty, continued she, has any cause to be alarm'd, for I shall pretend it is all my doing, and that you knew nothing of seeing him.’ 
“I was very averse to this meeting; but she was positive, and I was fearful of disobliging her, as I had no other friend but herself whom I could rely upon for making my peace with my father:—in fine, we went, Drapers-garden was the place of rendezvous; mr. Welby was there before us,—he affected, as had been contrived between my aunt and him, to have come 
there by chance, which a little saved my blushes;—after walking a turn or two, talking on ordinary matters, he proposed going to Ranelagh;—my aunt reply'd, that she had never seen the place, and could not do it in better company;—it did not become me to oppose what she had agreed to,—a coach waited which carried us directly thither;—it was very early in the evening and the company were not yet come, so we had the gardens to ourselves:—my aunt was so much in his interest, or rather mine, that she gave him all the opportunities the place would admit of to declare his passion to me, which he did in the most pathetic terms, while she pretended to amuse herself with looking on the story of Pamela, painted on the walls: —I was far from giving any encouragement to what he said, yet, by an irresistible impulse, was prevented from treating it with that severity I wish'd to have done. 
“But why should I detain your attention by particulars?—this meeting was productive of a second,—that of a third,—and so on, for a succession of several days; till at last, finding in myself an inclination to be too much 
pleased with his addresses, and dreading the consequence, I resolv'd to put an end to them. 
“I took the first opportunity of being alone with him to tell him that I had consider'd of the honour he did me, and found it impossible for me to accept the hand he offer'd, so intreated him to withdraw his affection, if in reality he had so much for me as he pretended, and talk to me no more upon that subject;—the manner in which I spoke convincing him I was in earnest, he seem'd much amaz'd,—made such replies as might be expected from a lover, accused destiny, and the influence of ill stars,—complain'd of his want of power to please me, and laid the blame of my refusal on my aversion to his person;—this struck me, and in the sincerity of my soul,”—‘No, sir, said I, wrong not your own merits, or my just sense of them, so far as to harbour such a thought: —I blush not to confess, that of all mankind you have the preference in my heart;—but what avails it when there is a bar between us, which all the love in the world, on both sides, would never be able to surmount!’ —Ah, madam, cried he hastily, what bar?’ 
—“I then told him 
that I was determin'd never to marry without the consent of parents:” —‘If that be all, rejoin'd he briskly, I do not despair but to be able to make such proposals to your father as he will not disdain to listen to.’ —‘However that may be, answer'd I, you, sir, have a father too,—it is his consent I chiefly mean, and without his permission of the continuance of your addresses, be assured I will not receive them.’ 
“He now seem'd much disconcerted,—sigh'd, and was silent for several minutes,”—‘Well, madam, said he, you shall be obey'd;—my thoughts were lately bent on travelling,—every thing was ready for my design; but on the sight of you love laid a sudden embargo on my feet, and I then made a thousand excuses to my father for deferring my voyage; but I will now confess to him the whole truth, and implore his sanction to my vows;—he is generous,—I am his only son,—he loves me, and I may perhaps succeed;—I will, at least, make trial of my fate, and to-morrow you will see me either the most happy or the most miserable of men.’ 
“He parted from me with great emotions, nor was I less disquieted; but I acquainted not my aunt with this conversation, knowing she would severely chide me, and think, as indeed I did myself, that the step I had taken would entirely overthrow what she had taken so much pains to promote: —I neither saw nor heard any thing of my lover all the next day, and this confirm'd me in what before I scarce doubted;—I pass'd the night in anxieties enough; but the next morning found my condition revers'd, in a manner which I could never have imagin'd;—soon after breakfast my father's footman came in a great hurry to acquaint me that my father commanded me to return home immediately;—I was in a strange surprize;—I knew not before he was in town,—could not guess by what means he was directed where to find me, and was in the utmost dilemma whether I ought to rejoice or tremble at being sent for;—I would fain have staid for my aunt, who was just gone out, to have taken her with me; but the fellow told me that his orders were to bring me that instant, so I said no more but obey'd the summons. 
“On my arrival my father met me in the parlour,—I threw myself at his feet and begg'd forgivness;”—‘Rise, my child, said he, embracing me,—I do forgive you;—the hand of Heaven has been in what you have done, and directed all your steps;—your fears of a forced marriage are now over,—sir Thomas has resign'd his claim to one fitter for your years;—they are both here, and wait your presence to ratify the contract I have already made for you.’ 
“Judge, ladies, what I felt;—I was no longer at a loss for the happy event; the sudden surcharge of unexpected joy rushing in at once upon me was more than I could well support;—I was almost fainting when my father led me into the next room, where sat sir Thomas Welby and his son; the latter, as I have since heard, was in much the same condition as myself; but the former pitying my confusion, took me by the hand with these words, deliver'd in the most sprightly tone,”—‘Come, daughter, said he, for such you now are,—your father has given you to me, and the least I can do, to attone for the troubles I have occasion'd you, is 
to give my son to you, and hope you will not refuse to accept the present;’—as he spoke this he join'd my hand with his son's,—and added,”—‘Take each other, and be as happy as love and the mutual consent of parents can make you:’ —“Neither of us could speak for some time; but when we had recover'd ourselves enough to do so, the acknowledgments we made were very well receiv'd by both the old gentlemen. 
“As there wanted but little preparations for a marriage so much desired on all sides, the ceremony was perform'd in three days after; and I have now nothing more to acquaint you with, but that mr. Welby still persisting in his desire of seeing foreign parts, I have gladly consented to accompany him in his travels.”
