Concludes the distressful narrative. 
As the waiters were present, nothing was said during the whole time of dinner, concerning the subject which that necessary appendix to life had interrupted; but the cloth was no sooner taken away, than the three ladies, as well as mr. Lovegrove, testify'd the interest they 
took in their fair guest's affairs, by their impatience for knowing the event. 
She reply'd to the many complaisant things they said to her with such an air and grace as convinced them, more than any thing she had related, that she had indeed been educated in the most genteel manner, and also been accustom'd to converse with persons of the best fashion and greatest politeness. 
But though the discourse that pass'd between them, on the score of mere civility, might very well deserve a place in this work, I shall omit the repetition, as it might be apt to make the reader's attention wander from the main point; and only say, that she prosecuted her history in the following terms: 
“My father, said she, now condescended to talk to me in the mildest, and withal in the most pathetic stile;—he endeavoured to allure my young heart by enumerating and displaying the pleasures that attend on wealth and grandeur;—he remonstrated to me, that the circumstances of our family would not permit his children, especially his daughters, to be directed only by inclination in the article of 
marriage; and that as I could find no possible objection to my lover but being somewhat too old, gratitude for the happiness he was ready to put me in possession of, might very well attone for that defect. 
“You say you cannot love this gentleman, continued he; but pray what is this passion that is call'd love but a vain delusion, an ignis satuus of the mind that leads all that follow it astray;—suppose, rejecting the certain good, fortune now puts into your power, and you should hereafter fix your fancy either on some one who has not the means of supporting you, or on one who returns not your affections, how truly miserable would be your state! 
“I could find no arguments to oppose against those he urged, and could only answer with my tears,—till being bid to speak, and the command several times repeated, I at last sobb'd out,—that I would make use of my utmost endeavours to obey him. 
“I know not whether his meanaces at first, and his persuasions afterwards, might not have made me at that time 
promise to do every thing he would have me; but some company coming in, luckily perserved me from adding to the guilt of disobedience that of deceit. 
“These visiters staid with us till very late, so I was reliev'd from any farther persecutions for that night; but the next morning at breakfast they were renew'd, and as I had no heart to consent, nor courage absolutely to refuse, I could only beg him to allow me a little time to bring my mind to a conformity with his will. 
“It is certain that my aversion to this match seem'd unreasonable even to myself, and I did all I could to conquer it; but my efforts to that purpose being fruitless, I set myself to consider, whether to live under the everlasting displeasure of a father whom I revered and loved, perhaps turn'd out of doors by him and exposed to poverty and contempt, or to pass my whole life in opulence with the man I hated, would be the least of evils. 
“Oh, ladies!—how impossible is it to represent what it was I felt while thus employ'd;—to which foever of these ways I turn'd my thoughts I was all 
horror and confusion;—the present idea seemed still the worst;—I was distracted,—irresolute, and fluctuated between both; and all I knew of myself was, that I was wholly incapable of supporting either. 
“To heighten my affliction, though I had many acquaintance, I had no one friend on whom I could depend for assistance or advice;—my sister, who by the rules of nature should have pitied my distress, rather added to it by all the ways she could invent. 
“Indeed she never loved me, and I have reason to believe I owe great part of my father's severity to her insinuations;—I will tell you an incident which confirms me in that belief,—it was this: 
“The very sunday before the misfortune I am now reciting befel me, a young gentleman happened to fit in a pew just opposite to mine,—he fix'd his eyes upon me with so much earnestness, during the whole time of divine service, that I could not help observing him with some confusion;—after we came out of church, turning my head back on some occasion, I perceived he followed me, though at a 
distance; but when I came near our door, the footman who attended me stepping before to knock, he advanced hastily and came time enough to make me a profound reverence just as I was entering the house;—I was a little confounded, as I had never seen him before;—I return'd his civility, however, and went in;—my sister, who had not been at church that day, was looking out of a window and beheld this passage;—she rallied me a little upon it, and ask'd me who that pretty fellow was that came to the door with me;—I told her the simple truth, and it pass'd off till we were going to bed, when one of the maids told me, in her presence, a fine young gentleman had watch'd the footman as he was going out on some errand, and ask'd him abundance of questions concerning me;—I thought it a little strange, but said nothing, nor did my sister seem to take much notice of it. 
“I thought little of this adventure, but found she afterwards made a handle of it, not only to possess my father with an opinion that I rejected the lover he recommended to me for the sake of one who was my own choice, but also to reproach me as having encouraged a clandestine courtship. 
“I mention this only to shew how destitute I was of any consolation whatsoever; but in the midst of perturbations, which almost deprived me of my senses, an expedient started at once into my head, which flatter'd me with some small prospect of relief. 
“My lover appeared to be a man who wanted neither good sense nor generosity; and I fancied that if he knew the true state of my heart, the one would shew him the extreme madness of marrying a woman who had so utter a dislike to him, and the other make him ashamed of rendering miserable the person he pretended to love. 
“On this foundation I built my hopes, and resolved on his next visit to make him thoroughly acquainted with the deplorable condition to which I was reduced by his unfortunate passion; and to beseech him to withdraw his pretensions as of his own accord, and without hinting to my father that any thing in my behaviour had been the cause. 
“But alas!—I had no sooner contriv'd this project, than I found the impracticability of putting it into execution; 
;—my father had a closet which opened from his bed-chamber, was between that and the dining-room, and divided from the latter but by a thin partition. 
“Good God, continued this afflicted fair one, how every thing conspired against me,—my father had always kept the key of this closet himself, but now had given it to my sister, and I soon found for no other purpose than that she should hear from thence what pass'd between me and my lover, and give him an account. 
“Though I only suspected this at first, but was certain of it when being call'd down from the chamber where I lay to receive my lover who waited for me in the dining-room, I saw, as I cross'd the stair-case, the shadow of my sister passing hastily into the very closet I have mention'd. 
“The old gentleman was in great good humour that day, and perhaps my tears and prayers might have work'd on him the effect I wish'd, had I not been so unhappily disappointed of making the experiment. 
“Having taken notice, I suppose, that I wore no watch, though indeed I had one, but it being out of order was sent some time before to be mended he brought with him a fine repeater set round with diamonds, and begg'd me to accept it;—as I knew who was witness of our conversation I durst not refuse his present, and much less talk to him in the manner I had intended. 
“I knew not then what course to take, but at last bethought me of employing my pen to give him that information which my tongue was deprived of all opportunity of doing;—accordingly I wrote to him in this manner: 

“Sir,
It is only in your power to save me from the worst of miseries,—that of a forced marriage;—my father is inexorable to my tears, and resolute to compel me to be yours; but not all his authority, your merits, nor my just sensibility of them can ever bring my heart to consent to the union you propose: —in fine, I cannot love you as a husband, but shall always regard you as the best of friends, if you forego the claim parental power has given 
you, and refuse that hand, the acceptance of which would infallibly make you no less wretched than myself;—consider therefore, sir, what it is you are about, and drive not an unhappy maid to desperation; for be assured I will seek relief in death rather than be 
“Yours. 

“This I folded up, but neither sealed nor directed it, as I designed to slip it into his own hands as he should be going away from his next visit;—but here again my scheme was frustrated, my father coming home before he went away and waiting on him down stairs. 
“The ensuing day, however, I thought myself more fortunate;—he came, and business calling him away somewhat before his usual hour, I follow'd to the dining-room door and gave him the paper, saying at the same time,—I beseech you, sir, to consider seriously on the contents of this,—and make no mention of it to my father.’ 
“He look'd very much surprised, and seemed as if about to open what I gave him; but I clapp'd my hand hastily 
upon his,—crying,—For Heaven's sake take care what you do, this is no proper place;‘—and with these words turn'd quick into the room to prevent any questions he might have made. 
“My heart flutter'd a little at the step I had taken;—suspence is a very uneasy situation; but as I thought it impossible that any man would venture to marry a woman who had wrote to him in the manner I had done, I grew more composed, and slept much better that night than for several preceding ones. 
“But, oh! how short lived was my ease, and how terrible a surcharge of woe did the next day present me with;—my father, who went out soon after breakfast, return'd not till the cloth was laid for dinner, and then only to tell me that he had been with my lover all the morning;—that every thing was concluded between them; and that the marriage should be solemnized at our house the evening of the succeeding day. 
“Judge, ladies, of my condition;—the convict at the bar feels not more horror at the sentence of approaching 
fate, than I did at the event which I had vainly flatter'd myself was far removed from me;—the amazement I was in kept me for some moments in a kind of stupid silence;—my father was so taken up in directing my sister what preparations she should make for this affair that he regarded not my confusion, till grief and despair unloosed my tongue, and I cried out,—Oh, sir, did you not say I should have time? 
“Time, reply'd he, can any time be more lucky for you than this, when you are going to have the same settlement as if you brought ten thousand pounds? your lover is so pleased with the pretty trick you play'd him last night, that I believe I might have got more for you if I had insisted upon it;—but this was his own offer, and it is very well;—we are going together to my lawyer's to order the writings. 

“My sister then ask'd him if he would not dine, to which he answer'd in the negative, and after giving her some farther instructions, left us to return to his intended son-in-law, who he said waited for him at the chocolate-house. 
“Dinner was presently brought in,—I sat down, but could not eat a bit;—my sister, who since the death of my mother had been house-keeper and affected to be very notable, talked of nothing but the hurry she should be in,—and what should be the first,—and what should be the second course of the wedding supper; for though there were but two or three friends to be invited, yet my father had order'd that every thing for this dreadful ceremony should be set forth with as much elegance as possible. 
“On my making no reply to all she said, she told me I was a sullen fool, and did not deserve my good fortune;—I had no spirit to enter into any altercations with her, so flung from the table and retir'd to my chamber to vent those cruel agitations with which I was now more than ever overwhelm'd. 
“The first reflections that occur'd to me were on this hated lover's being pleased with the paper I had given him, and telling my father that I had play'd him a pretty trick. —What, cried I to myself, is it not enough that 
he neglects my complaits,—must he also insult me for them, and turn my grief into derision? 
“But I had no time to waste on this subject,—my doom was fix'd, and I must either fly or tamely submit to it;—I resolved on the former whatever should be the consequence, and now thought of nothing but the means of accomplishing it. 
“It was not long before I determin'd on what course to take; I have an aunt married to a merchant at Cork,—I believe she will grant me her protection,—I am going, however, to make the experiment, and if she refuses, must content myself to earn my bread either by going to service or working at my needle.”
