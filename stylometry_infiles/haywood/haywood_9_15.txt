Seems big with the promise of some mighty matters hereafter to be brought to light. 
It was so very late when the little company broke up, that Bellpine had no opportunity of putting any questions to Jemmy concerning his sentiments of the lady he had introduced him to; and as they lived different ways, took leave of each other at mr. Chit's door, without any farther speech that night. 
Full of impatience, however, for the success of his pernicious plot, he went pretty early the next morning to his house; and, according to his wish, found him quite alone, and not yet ready to go abroad. 
He was scarce sat down, when he had the satisfaction of hearing Jemmy himself prepare the way for the conversation he intended to entertain him with, by thanking him for the pleasure he had enjoy'd the night before through his means. 
‘I wish from my soul, reply'd this wicked incendiary, that it were in my power to procure you a much more ample and substantial one; music indulges no more than a single sense, miss Chit has charms that might engross the whole five. —Ah, Jemmy,—continued he, embracing him, what a heaven it would be, after an hour or two of dalliance, to be lull'd to sleep by that angelic voice, pressing at the same time the ruby lips whence the transporting sounds proceeded! and then, ye gods, awake to a new raptures and repeated bliss.’ 
Jemmy laugh'd heartily at the extasy which the other affected to feel through the force of imagination. ‘You wish me a happiness, cried he, yet speak, methinks, as if you could not avoid being one of those who would envy me the possession of it; but my dear friend, added he, you have no need to be under any apprehensions on that force; for to deal sincerely, I like miss Chit as a musician, but shall never think of her as a woman.’ 
These words gave a most terrible shock to the high-raised expectations of Bellpine; but, as he was master of an uncommon share of artifice, and an equal presence of mind, it was easy for him to conceal one emotion under the shew of another; and, starting back with a well counterfeited surprise, ‘Impossible, cried he, you cannot sure be so insensible, so altogether untouch'd with charms that half the town are running mad after!’ 
‘You know, answer'd Jemmy, with a very serious air, I am under engagements elsewhere, which will not permit me to make my addresses to her or any other woman upon honourable terms; and I cannot suppose they would be accepted by miss Chit if offer'd with a view of a different nature.’ 
‘I cannot flatter you so far as that, indeed,’ reply'd he, still disconcerted, and more so, when Jemmy hastily rejoin'd, ‘I wonder, Bellpine, that having so just a sense of the lady's merit, you never made your court to her yourself?’ 
On an interrogatory so unthought on, all his audacity forsook him; he was silent for some moments, but at length recovering himself, his ready wit furnish'd him with an excuse which seem'd plausible enough, and was certainly the only one that could have had the least appearance of sincerity. 
‘I shall disguise nothing of the truth from you, said he; to be plain then, it is my vexatious circumstances which alone deter me; since my uncle has taken a step that may possibly deprive me of the inheritance I was born to expect, I have no dowry to offer with my services; a woman that has money demands a jointure adequate to the sum she brings; and for me to marry one whose only portion is her beauty and good qualities, would render both her and myself for ever miserable; so that whether miss Chit is, or is not a fortune, she is quite out of the question with me as a wife.’ 
He spoke all this with so much seeming candour and openness of heart, that Jemmy thought himself more than ever confirm'd in the opinion he had always entertain'd of the good sense and honour of his friend; and readily agreed with him, that where a marriage was consummated between two persons, neither of whom had a sufficient competency, it could not fail of making both parties equally unhappy, and also of entailing lasting wretchedness on their posterity. 
Bellpine soon grew weary of this discourse, as it had no connexion with his present views; and therefore made his visit much shorter than he at first had intended it, and retir'd to a place where he might give a loose to his discontent, and contrive some other means of bringing his designs to perfection, since those he had already essay'd had proved so ineffectual. 
As it was not in his power to make Jemmy become guilty in fact, his next resource was to make him appear so: to blacken him by any ill report directly to Jenny herself, he knew would be in vain, and treated with contempt by a woman of her penetration; he therefore took a more artful and more sure, tho' slow method of infusing the poison of jealousy and indignation into her soul; he gave it out in whispers, inuendoes, and dark hints, among those whom he found fond of scandal and of explaining mysteries of that kind, that Jemmy had an utter aversion of Jenny in his heart; that he was seeking some excuse to break entirely with her; and that it was miss Chit who had caused this change in him: he had no great cause to doubt but that this rumour would spread from one to another through the town, and become so much the universal secret, that it could not fail of reaching Jenny's ears: and then he concluded that it would, by degrees, steal itself into her belief. 
As Jemmy was a man of pleasure, and did not live without many transient amours, it may seem a little strange to some people that Bellpine, who by his intimacy with him, could not be a stranger to the errors of his conduct, did not chuse to get communicated to Jenny such things as a very small enquiry would convince her were true, rather than endeavour to alarm her with reports which had no foundation in fact. 
But this was not Bellpine's way of reasoning; he rightly judged, that a woman of Jenny's understanding might easily be brought to forgive the frailties of youth and nature in a man of Jemmy's gay and volatile disposition; but would be irreconcileable, implacable, if once made to believe he address'd any other upon honourable terms. 
It is easy for persons capable of inventing falsehoods to propagate them in such a manner as to make them pass current for a time, and yet avoid any detection of their being the authors of it; it is not by saying directly a thing is so, that a story so much gains credit, as by half words,—winks,—nods, and other such like gestures;—these are the traps which catch the unwary, and give an air of reality to that which has no existence. Bellpine at least was well versed in this art, and practised it with such success as to the matter in question, and was so far from being suspected of having raised this report, that he has often been ask'd by those who heard from other hands what his opinion was concerning the truth of it. 
Jenny, on account of her many accomplishments and good nature, was so generally beloved by those who knew her, and her character in such estimation with those who were not personally acquainted with her, that none could hear, without the most extreme surprise, that she was about to be forsaken by a man who from his very infancy had been taught to look upon her as his future wife, and for whom she made no secret of having the most tender affection. 
But whenever this subject was mention'd to Bellpine, as it frequently so happen'd, he affected to hang down his head and be entirely silent; or, if desir'd by some one or other of the company to speak his thoughts, ‘I am no judge of the affair, would he say, mr. Jessamy is my friend, and I should be loth to think him capable of a bad action; miss Jenny is certainly a fine girl, and so is miss Chit; if he has changed his sentiments he doubtless has his reasons, but I know nothing of it.’ 
His intimacy with Jemmy was so well known, that these undeterminate answers from him gave more credit to the story than the most positive assurances given by any other person could have done. 
Nor was this all; to give the greater appearances of the truth of what he thought it was so much his interest to have believed, he contrived it so that Jemmy and miss Chit should frequently be seen together in public places, though, for the most part, they met without the least design on the side of either of them. 
Jemmy, indeed, could not avoid being somewhat accessary in corroborating the aspersion cast upon himself, as he had been introduced to that young lady, and received by her in the manner above-mentioned, the compliasance due to her sex and rank, join'd to the pleasure he took in hearing her sing and play, oblig'd him sometimes to visit her; Bellpine was generally with them; and when he was so, always found some pertext or other to draw them out where he knew there would be people who would not fail to take notice of their being together. 
It requires more pains to be a villain than some people may imagine; besides imposing upon Jemmy, and making him act in a manner which shew'd his sentiments to the world far different from what they were in reality, Bellpine had also another card to play, which cost him little less contrivance. 
As he had possess'd miss Chit at first with a belief that Jemmy was seriously inspired with a passion for her, and knew very well that gentleman's behaviour had not at all been conformable to the assurances he had given her on his account, it behoved him to reconcile this contradiction so as not to leave her any room to suspect that deception he had put upon her. 
He therefore continued, day after day, to carry her some fresh intelligence of the fine things Jemmy said of her; and insinuated that there was a design on foot, which, when once executed, would afford him a plausible pretence for breaking off entirely with Jenny; and that then he would avow his passion and declare himself devoted only to her. 
Whether this young lady was absolutely convinced of the truth of what he said I will not take upon me to determine; because, indeed, it is highly probable she never gave herself the trouble to examine the consistency of the story. 
Dangerous, however, might such an imposition have been to some ladies, to have been flatter'd with the hopes of an alliance with a man such as Jemmy, perfectly agreeable in his person, accomplished in his manners, and opulent in his fortune; and then to find at once all those golden expectations vanish into air; might certainly have been fatal in its consequences, to a heart young, tender, and unexperienced in deceit. 
Happy was it for miss Chit, in this point at least, that the variety of company, the many fine things said to her by persons of condition, and particularly the devoirs, whether feign'd or real, of a certain foreign minister, hinder'd her from being too attentive to the idea which the artifices of Bellpine might otherwise have engross'd her with.
