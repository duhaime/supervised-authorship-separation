Contains a very strange and detestable instance of perfidiousness and ingratitude, in a person of the most honourable vocation. 
These two young ladies, who from their childhood had preserved an entire friendship for each other, could not meet after an absence of many months without the utmost demonstrations of affection on both sides;—after which Jenny gently reproached the other as having been very remiss of late in writing to her, and that whenever she did so her 
letters had been short, reserved, and such as ordinarily pass between persons who converse together merely through complaisance. 
‘Your charge would be very just, said Sophia, had it been in my power to have acted otherwise than I did;—but, indeed, my dear miss Jessamy, I had nothing to write except such things as were utterly improper for me to communicate by the post;—I am now, however, continued she with a deep sigh, come to tell you all, as well as to take my everlasting leave.’ 
These words, and the manner in which they were delivered, threw Jenny into so great an astonishment; that she had not the power of asking an explanation of them, which the other perceiving, saved her the trouble of speaking and went on: 
‘Yes, continued she, I shall very shortly be removed from all that ever yet have known me,—shall quit England as soon as the vessel that is to carry me is ready to put to sea, which I hope will be in a very few days;—nor, when you have heard my unhappy story, will you think it strange that I should be impatient to go from a place where 
I have received such cruel injustice as perhaps no woman but myself ever met with. 
‘Heavens! of what nature? cried Jenny with some eagerness. ‘Of a most monstrous,—and, I believe, unprecedented one, replied she; but I will keep you no longer in suspence,—you shall at once be let into the secret of those wrongs I have sustain'd, and of the folly which exposed me to them.’ 
Finding Jenny made no answer, but was prepared to give attention to what she was about to say, she wiped off some tears, which, in spite of her endeavours to restrain them, fell from her eyes; and then began the recital she had promised in the following terms: 
The history of Sophia.
“You may remember, my dear miss Jessamy, said she, in what a rage my brother flew out of the house after the ridiculous adventure you were witness of the last time you favoured me with a visit;—he then went no farther than to a gentleman's seat about four miles distant; but from thence proceeded to London, where he continued 
full three months:—on his return he appeared very pensive and discontented, which I at first imputed to the disappointment he had received from the lady you saw; but I soon found it arose from a quite different cause;—he had, it seems, mortgaged the best part of his estate to discharge some debts he had contracted at play, the only vice I know him guilty of, but to which he has always been too much addicted;—he had the generosity, however, to pay my fortune which was but five and twenty hundred pounds, into the Bank; he now gave me the bills, and told me that he must go and live in the southern parts of France till he had retrieved his circumstances, and that he had spoke to a gentleman about letting his house; but added, that I should be welcome to stay in it, and have the use of every thing till a tenant could be found, if I chose to do so. —This offer, having my own reasons for it, I gladly accepted of;—he had before prepared every thing for his departure, and in four days left me to myself. 
“You will doubtless wonder that I should chuse to remain in a great lone house without any companion, and be at the expence of keeping two maids 
and a man servant, which the income of my little fortune could ill afford, rather than come to town, where I might have been boarded in a genteel family and lived much cheaper, and more agreeably in the opinion of every body but myself. —I will tell you my reason for all this,—it was love,—love, that fatal frenzy of our sex,—that sure destruction of all that is dear to womankind;—I ought to blush even at the remembrance I ever was directed by it, much more to confess the shameful folly.” 
‘Hold, my dear Sophia, cry'd Jenny interrupting her,—take care what you say;’—mr. Dryden was certainly as good a judge of human nature as you can pretend to be, and he tells us that 

Love's an heroic passion, which can find
No room in any base degen'rate mind;
It kindles all the soul with honour's fire
To make the lover worthy his desire.
‘And I am of opinion that a virtuous love, such as I doubt not but yours was, ought never to be repented or ashamed of.’ 
“I allow the truth of what you say, answer'd Sophia; but then it must be a love conducted by prudence, and for a worthy object;—mine, alas, had neither the one nor the other of these excuses to plead in its defence,—as you will presently be convinced.” 
Here she stopp'd to give passage to some sighs which had been labouring in her bosom;—after which, growing a little more composed, she went on in the prosecution of her narrative. 
“While my brother was at London, resumed she, I unfortunately, as it has proved, happen'd into the acquaintance of a young Officer in the army, called Willmore,—the first time I saw him was at a gentleman's house about a mile distant from ours, where I sometimes visited:—tho' there were several other ladies in company he seemed to take a particular notice of me, and I could not avoid doing so of him;—he has, indeed, every thing in his person that can attract the eye and captivate the heart;—he is handsome,—well-made,—genteel,—has abundance of wit and vivacity, and tho' he talks a great deal never speaks but to the purpose. 
“When I took my leave, he would needs see me home, tho' I had a servant with me, and but three little fields to cross;—I refused this offer, but must own I could not help being very well pleased that he persisted in it. —In fine, he came home with me, and though as we walk'd he entertain'd me only with common subjects of conversation, yet he treated them in such a manner as appear'd to me very agreeable. 
“Among other things, happening to tell me that he had lodgings at Windsor, and was almost always there when not obliged to be with the regiment, I said it was a thing seldom heard of, that a gay young gentleman like him should prefer a little country town to the pleasures of London;—to which he reply'd, that hunting and reading were his favourite pleasures;”—‘The one, said he, I frequently take with very good company; and the other I am here more at liberty to indulge myself in than I could possibly be in London:’ 
—“He then ask'd me if I took any delight in the latter of these amusements, and on my answering that I did,”—‘Because, madam, rejoin'd 
he, I have all the public papers and new pamphlets constantly sent down to me as they come out, and if you will give me leave will wait on you with such of them as I shall find worthy your perusal.’ 
“Though I plainly saw this was no more than a pretence to visit me, yet I thought it so handsome a one, and afforded me so good an excuse for granting him the permission he desir'd, that I hesitated not to tell him, that I should readily accept, and be thankful for the favour he mention'd. 
“This was the method he took to introduce himself;—he was almost every day bringing me some new book or other; and, in return for this civility, I lent him such as he chose to read out of my brother's collection, which is esteem'd a very good one;—at first our conversation turned chiefly on the subjects with which we had mutually obliged each other; but after a few visits he threw off that constraint he had hitherto been under, and profess'd himself my lover. 
“As I have already confess'd the liking I had of his person, you will 
not expect to hear that I received the declaration of his passion with any disdain,—on the contrary, I am afraid I listen'd to it with too visible an approbation;—but however that might be,—for indeed I do not well remember how I behaved at that time,—all that I know is, that I forbad not his addresses. 
“I will not give you the trouble of hearing, nor myself the confusion of repeating, how very easily I was won to give credit to every thing he said in relation to his pretended passion, for such you will find it was, and not only pretended for the sake of gallantry and amusement, but for the carrying on a design the most low, base, and dishonourable that ever enter'd the heart of man, much less of a gentleman, to conceive or put in practice. 
“It was in the height of his courtship that my brother came home;—the hurry of his affairs,—the discontent he was in, and the short time he staid, hinder'd me from saying any thing to him concerning my new lover; but you now may perceive the motive which induced me so readily to embrace the offer he made me of staying 
in his house after he was gone;—I knew Willmore was fond of the country, and I dreaded lest I should see him less frequently in town;—fool that I was, not to consider that a man who truly loved would follow me any where. 
“As we grew more familiar in conversation, I found he was much better acquainted with the circumstances of our family than I could have thought he was;—among other things, he one day mention'd my brother's late miscarriage, and ask'd me, with some concern, whether it had been of any prejudice to my fortune;—I told him that it had not, and related to him how tender he had been of me in that point,—at which he seem'd extremely pleased, and said no more upon that subject. 
“Soon after this he went to London, where he staid upwards of a week,—a much longer time than ever he had done since my acquaintance with him;—the same day which brought him again to Windsor brought him also to visit me; but though his expressions were, I think, more endearing and more passionate than ever they had been, I perceived there was a certain 
air of melancholy about him, which very much affected me;—I could not forbear taking notice of it to him, and and ask'd him, with more tenderness than perhaps became me, if any ill accident had happen'd to him since he left me;—he told me not any;—but added, that he had been a little vex'd, and could not help thinking himself a very unlucky fellow. 
“On my farther desiring him to let me know the occasion of his chagrin, he told me—that he could not content himself with the condition of a subaltern;—that he had never enter'd into the army but with the hope of rising in it;—nor had accepted of a lieutenancy, which was the commission he then bore, but with the expectation of being soon a captain,”—Now, said he, just at this juncture an old officer has got leave to sell out,—and I might have his commission for about a thousand guineas and my own in exchange, which I have a gentleman ready to purchase. —This it is, my dear Sophia, added he, that has so much disconcerted me; for though I have offer'd a very large premium, and my bond to pay the money quarterly, I can no way raise it.’ 
“Bless me, cried I, have you no friends,—no relations who on such an occasion would not advance that sum?” —‘Yes, several, answer'd he, who would do it for a word speaking; but they are all of them either out of the kingdom, or at their country seats I know not how far off, and the thing must be done immediately or not at all; and Heaven knows whether I shall ever meet with such an opportunity again.’ 
“Indeed, my dear miss Jessamy, continued she, I thought it a great pity that any man, much more the person I loved and intended to make my husband, should lose so considerable an advantage through the want of what was in my power to supply him with;—I did not consider much on the matter, but stepp'd to my cabinet and took out Bank bills to the amount of a thousand pounds, which I put directly into his hands,”—‘There, mr. Willmore, said I, is the sum you stand in need of, and I hope it will not come too late to lay out in the purchase you mention.’ 
“Tho' I believe he saw enough into my weakness to expect I would do as 
I did, yet he seem'd equally surprised as transported with it,”—‘Well, my dear Sophia, cry'd he, kissing my hand,—this is generous indeed, and truly like yourself,—but I hope, continued he, you will soon consent to reap some part of the benefit of the favour you have conferr'd; and, as promotions in the army must come by degrees, who knows but you may one day see your lover,—I flatter myself long before then your husband, at the head of a regiment instead of a company!’ 
“I reply'd, that I wish'd him success for his own sake, and as to what related to myself we would talk of that hereafter;—he then told me that he would go to London very early the next morning, and at his return bring with him a bond in exchange for the bills I had obliged him with,”—‘which, added he with a gay air, if you should not think sufficient, I am ready to give you my person as a collateral security.’ 
She was in this part of her story when the tea equipage, that important article of a lady's drawing-room, was brought in, on which she was obliged to break off till it should be removed.
