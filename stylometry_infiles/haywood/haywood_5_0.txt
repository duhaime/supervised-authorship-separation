It wou'd be needless to inform you that I was
the only Daughter of the Marquiss D'Avila;
I believe there are none here ignorant of my
Birth, or the great Possessions I was left Mistress
of by the Death of that Grandee—Therefore
shall pass over those Days of Tranquillity, and begin
at the Rise of my Misfortunes. My Father
sometime before he dy'd had commenc'd a more
than ordinary Friendship for Don Francisco insomuch,
that by his Will he was made sole Guardian
of me and my Fortune—It was not
more than a Week after the Funeral Obsequies
were over, before I found I shou'd have Reason to
lament his Choice. Francisco had a Son whom
his Avarice and Ambition aim'd to make the
Master of the Marquiss's Estate. He propos'd the
matter to me in a manner which let me see he
expected I wou'd consent. I know not whether
Disdain or Anger had the greatest share in my
Thoughts, while I was oblig'd to listen to what
he said; but when I found he had done speaking,
I answer'd him in Terms, which sufficiently express'd
how much of both I conceiv'd for his
Designs—He had the Artifice, however, to
conceal his Discontent at my Refusal, and endeavour'd
to soften my Resentment, by telling me
nothing could have prevail'd on him to have been
guilty of so much Presumption, but to save the
Life of a darling Son, who was possess'd of too
violent a Passion for me, to suffer him to live, if 

I refus'd to encourage it. The Flatteries he made
use of, were as odious as the Assurance with
which he at first declared his Intentions; but
to put an end to both, I told him, I thought it
was yet too early for me to think of Love; but
that in a proper time I wou'd consider on what
he had said: I was indeed by this time a little
vex'd that I had seem'd to resent so far the Indignity
with which I thought myself treated, and
thinking it my safest way to get the Power my
Father had entrusted him with, out of his hands,
before I let him know my real Sentiments, dismiss'd
him with a greater show of Civility than
he deserv'd, or than I cou'd, without doing a Violence
to myself, assume. But a strange turn of
Fortune immediately happening, the Complaisance
I had before dissembled, I was oblig'd to make
use of in reality—Don Paranello, the
Successor of my Father in his Title, enterd a Claim
in the High Court of Judicature for the Estate
also Francisco had been bred to the Law, was
one of the most Cunning that ever practis'd it,
and, besides, was the best acquainted with the
Truth of our Affairs of any body: It was on him
therefore I cou'd alone rely; it was him in
whom I was forc'd to confide, and to depend. 
The Suit was long, and made so great a Noise,
that doubtless it has reach'd your Ears; the Success
indeed was mine, but I was frequently in all
Appearances so near losing it, and so much distrest
by that means, (which as I have since heard was
purposely contriv'd by Francisco to work me to
his Designs) that in the midst of my Trouble he
extorted from me a Promise in Writing, to marry
his Son, in case he shou'd secure my Patrimony. 
But, alas! before the Cause being determin'd in
my favour cou'd encourage him to demand the
Performance of the Contract, Fate threw a Bar 

to disappoint his Hopes, greater than that my former
Aversion had oppos'd—Alvario
being lately return'd from his Travels, was brought
by his Father (there having been a long Intimacy
between our Families) to visit me: Whatever Endeavours
I had been making to enable me to keep
my Word with Francisco were now render'd
of no Effect; I lov'd Alvario from the first
moment I beheld him, and have had many reasons
since to believe I made the same Impression on
him—both felt a Passion too violent for
Constraint, we lov'd, and we confess'd it to each
other, but conceal'd it from the rest of the World. 
He thought it not proper to acquaint his Father
with his Sentiments of me, till he saw how my
Affairs would go, fearing that, tho' he had a
great Esteem for me, he wou'd not be satisfied his
Son shou'd marry a Woman who, 'twas probable,
might have no other Fortune than her intrinsick
Worth—It was for this reason our Amour
was kept a secret till after the Decree, and when it
was past, my Engagements to Francisco deterr'd
me from revealing it. I very well knew the Advantages
he wou'd have over me, if I attempted to
break thro' a Contract, so solemn and so secure as
that he had exacted from me it was with the most
ardent and tender Sollicitations that Alvario
was continually importuning me; either to run the
Risque of all that Villain cou'd alledge against me,
or to permit him to set me free, by driving from
the World that Extorter of my Faith: but to neither
of these cou'd I ever be brought to consent; 
I lov'd him with a Regard too sincere and disinterested
to suffer him to be Partaker of my Misfortunes; 
and contenting myself for the present with the Happiness
of daily seeing the Man who was so dear to
me, left the compleating my future Felicity to
Fate, still hoping that some lucky Revolution 

wou'd happen to make me Mistress of myself— 
But in this Time of mutual Tenderness, I looking
on him as my Husband, being the only Man I
resolv'd shou'd ever be so, there pass'd between
us what nothing but the extreme Extravagance of
my Grief cou'd have oblig'd me to reveal— 
But there, continued she, pointing to Fernando
there stands the unhappy Product of his Mother's
too great Affection and unresisting Tenderness! 
Shame here, at what She had confess'd, was near
depriving her of her Speech; she stopp'd for some
Moments, unable to proceed; but perceiving the
whole Assembly had their Eyes fix'd on Fernando,
and as she thought with a greater show
of Softness and Concern than they had done before
it, encourag'd her to resume her Story, which she
did in these Words. 
The Care which Alvario took, said she, in
concealing my Misfortune from the World, and
at the same time, under a borrow'd Name, expressing
the most tender Indulgence to the Child, was
some Alleviation of my Sorrows; nor did I doubt
but he wou'd gladly repair my Honour, by publickly
Marrying me assoon as I had got rid of
my Engagement with Francisco but that, alas!
was an Impossibility, and all the Offers I made
him to release me, were in vain; at last, tir'd with
a fruitless Hope, and unwilling to be the hindrance
of Alvario's Fortune, he being at that Time
belov'd by a Lady of Quality and Beauty, I retir'd
myself from the World, and gave my free Consent
that he should Marry, which he soon after did the
Lovely and Vertuous Mariana, by whom he
had Felisinda. Thus you see my Reasons for
entring into a Life, which I now find so much
Pleasure in, that methinks I wonder all my Sex
are not Monasticks, or how they can be so far
infatuated, as to prefer the bitter Sweets and Troubles 

of a noisy World, to that happy Tranquillity
a Cloyster affords—And thus, in
the Confession of my Foible, are two Things
unravell'd, which I am satisfied have hitherto seem'd
Riddles, the one why Alvario, neglecting those
who seem'd the nearest in Blood, left so much
of his Estate to one believ'd a Stranger to his
Name; and the other, why both that Gentleman
and Myself so strenuously oppos'd the Marriage of
Fernando and Felisinda. If this Discovery
may have the Effect it ought, to make those
Relations of Alvario, who thought themselves
wrong'd in his Testament, less discontented than
they have been, and to prevail on Fernando
to convert the Passion he long has had for Felisinda,
into that sort of Love, which a Brother
may be allow'd to have for a Sister, I shall not
repent that I have made it: and above all,
if that unhappy Youth, now knowing it altogether
impossible to gratifie his Desires by Marrying
with Felisinda, will discover where Alantha
is, and make himself her Husband, I shall
return contented to my Cell, and have no more
to do with Care or Fear.
