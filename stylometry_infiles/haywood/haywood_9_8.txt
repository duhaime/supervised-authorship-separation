Affords fresh matter for edification to those who stand in need of it, as well as entertainment to such who do not. 
Jenny had an infinity of good nature, and was extremely troubled at the disagreement she had seen between two persons whom she thought had been entirely happy in being united to each other:—the more she ruminated on the behaviour of mrs. Marlove, the more she found in it to condemn; but then she was also equally surprised to find so great a change in that of her husband; she had frequently been in their company while in their days of courtship;—she had seen him humour all the little whims and caprices which the vanity of flatter'd beauty had made her guilty of;—she had heard him praise even her very foibles, and seem charmed with what the rest of the world most blamed her for. 
‘Good God, cried she to herself, how strange a reverse does marriage bring! who that sees a man a husband would ever think he had been a lover?—till she was a wife, he would not have presumed to argue with her on any point she took upon her to assert;—he would not then have opposed his reason to any folly she committed; 'tis true she has insisted on a thing, which he must have been both ungenerous and weak to have comply'd with; yet would he once not have dared to have contradicted her in much greater matters:—if she is proud,—imperious and vain, it is on his own too obsequiousness he ought to lay the blame. Oh, why will men endeavour to persuade us we are goddesses, only to create themselves the pains of convincing us afterwards that we are but mortals! 
‘Yet after all, said she again, we know that the extravagant encomiums so lavishly bestowed upon us before marriage, are mere words of course; the homage,—the submissions paid us by the lover, all form and empty shew; and, as they are put in practice only to sooth our vanity, ought not to deceive our understandings so far as to make us imagine we either deserve, or have a right to expect the continuance of them, when the motive that induced them is no more. —Marriage, as it removes all coyness and reserve in the women, so it destroys all suspence in the men:—he is then in possession of his wishes, has done with hopes and fears; and sollicitations of course must also cease. 
‘Stripp'd, therefore, of that imaginary authority with which we once flatter'd ourselves, it is certainly the business of our sex to endeavour, by the most soft and obliging behaviour, to preserve and improve, if possible, the love of him, whom it is no longer in our power to awe by a contrary way of acting. 
‘A too great tenaciousness of our own merits, pursued she; the pride of doing whatever we have a mind to, and of imposing the laws of our own will on that of the lover, may be submitted to while we are mistresses; but will never be borne with when we are wives:—the men, conscious of that superiority which custom and the matrimonial covenant has given them, never fail to exert it, and opposition on our side is struggling against the stream, and but serves to shew our weakness the more in the vain attempt. 
‘In my opinion, went she still on, the way to accomplish what we aim at, is not to urge it with too much vehemence, even in the most reasonable things, much less can we expect success when we insist on such as are in themselves unjustifiable:—as in the case of mrs. Marlove; and I much fear, that if many contests of this nature happen, they will by degrees weaken her husband's affection for her; perhaps, in time, utterly destroy it, and render her both unhappy and unpitied.’ 
In this manner did the sagacious Jenny reason within herself upon the cause in question; and upon the whole, her judgment entirely acquitted mr. Marlove of all blame, and gave the verdict against his too assuming wife, for whose late behaviour she could find no excuse, except her extreme youth, and inexperience of the temper of mankind, that lady being but sixteen, which was two years short of the age she had attain'd herself. 
This naturally led her into reflections on the folly of two persons uniting themselves together by the solemn ties of marriage, without having well consider'd the duties of the state they were about to enter into, and confirm'd her in the resolution she before had taken of living single, till she was as well assured, as human reason could make her, that both herself and the man who was to be her husband, were equally qualified to render each other truly happy. 
She longed, however, to see Jemmy, that she might relate this story to him, and hear his sentiments upon it; but she saw him not all the next day, which a little surprised her, as four and twenty hours seldom passed over without his making her one visit, if no more; the accident, which now occasioned his absence so much longer than usual, was, indeed, of a pretty particular nature;—it was this: 
On his coming home the night before he found a letter that had been left for him, requesting his company at an entertainment to be given the next day on a very extraordinary occasion, by a gentleman who had been an intimate acquaintance of his father's;—the invitation was too pressing for him to refuse complying with it, which otherwise he would gladly have done, as he expected not to find any guests there suitable to his age or humour. 
He found himself, however, agreeably deceived in this conjecture, and was surprised, on his entrance into a spacious room, to see it fill'd with a very brilliant company of both sexes, who being assembled in order to celebrate the most joyous circumstance that can happen in private life, came with a sincere resolution of contributing every thing in the power of each to do honour to the feast prepared for them. 
But not to keep the reader in suspence, the person who made this invitation was a gentleman of birth and fortune;—he was married in his youth to a lady of celebrated beauty, and every way his equal; but, through a too great love of pleasure on his side, and some errors in conduct, though without any breach of virtue on her's, they had been separated for fourteen years, without the least probability of being reconciled, and even less of their ever living together again, as all the interposition of their friends for that purpose, during so long a space of time, had been in vain, and was, at last, entirely given over:—the unhoped for event, notwithstanding, came to pass;—both parties were alike touch'd with a just sensibility of their former mistakes, and return'd to the embraces of each other, with more ardency of affection than that with which they had first met in marriage. 
There is certainly nothing which so much demonstrates the sincerity of our reformation, as a free confession that we have been in the wrong. —‘I was, said the gentleman, in possession of a treasure before I had attain'd to an age capable of knowing the true value of it; I wore it as an idiot does a diamond, careless on my arm, and liable to be snatch'd from me by the first person who admired its lustre;—but heaven has preserved it as a blessing for my riper judgment.’ 
He concluded these words with kissing his lady's hand, and then went on, ‘I was, continued he, one of those thoughtless wretches, which the poet, doubtless, had in his eye when he wrote these lines: 
‘Fictitious joys allur'd my dazzled senses,
‘And led them in the mistic maze a while;
‘Beguil'd with empty air, my restless heart
‘Still after some untasted pleasure roam'd;
‘But now the wanderer seeks his peaceful home,
‘And there finds all it vainly sought abroad.
‘I cannot suffer you, my dear,’ said the lady, with a most becoming smile, to take upon yourself the whole blame of that unhappy disagreement, which has so long divided us;—I also have had my share of guilt, though in a different way from yours;—if you have been too gay, I have been too inconsiderate;—I have endeavoured not to make home delightful to you;—I rather, by a thousand impertinencies and follies, render'd my presence tiresome; I had no idea of the duties of my place, but behaved, when set at the head of a family, as I had done in the nursery, and expected to be humour'd in the same manner.’ 
Thus did this lately re-united pair equally condemn themselves for the miscarriages of their past conduct; but, while they were speaking, there were not a few in company of both sexes, who hung down their heads, as conscious of not being wholly free from the errors they heard mentioned. 
Jemmy, according to the agreement made between him and Jenny, kept an observant eye on all those whom he found were married, and easily perceived, by the looks which one of them in particular frequently gave his wife, that they were far from living together in a perfect harmony; tho', as he had never seen either of them before, and was wholly unacquainted with their circumstances, conditions, or humours, it was utterly impossible for him to guess from what latent cause the discord he discover'd proceeded;—but as it was the husband who seem'd most dissatisfied, he concluded, without knowing any thing of the matter, that it must be the wife who was to blame. 
The men are apt to be too partial to one another on this score:—in the little time that Jemmy had at present for reflection, these lines of mr. Dryden's came directly into his head: 
Few know what cares a husband's peace destroys,
His real griefs and his dissembled joys.
It is altogether impracticable for married people, when so unhappy as to have any real or imagined cause of complaint against each other, to keep the uneasiness they labour under from being visible to the world;—however perfect, as to other things they may be in the art of dissimulation, in this, spite of their utmost endeavours, the sentiments of their hearts will break out;—every look,—every gesture, betrays the inward pangs they feel;—which shews, that of all circumstances of discontent, those of marriage are with the most difficulty sustain'd. 
Jemmy was afterwards informed, that the last mention'd gentleman was one of the many whom, it is not in the power of fortune to make happy;—that he took a kind of gloomy pleasure in creating to himself ideal ills, and then started at the apparition, which nothing but his own productive fancy had conjured up. 
His wife was far from being a beauty; and as to her person, she had received no more from nature than would just serve to make her pass for not disagreeable; as to her behaviour, it was affable and chearful, but withal extremely modest; for as she never affected a too great reserve, so she was equally free from all that had the appearance of levity; but neither the little power her eyes had of captivating, nor the prudence of her carriage, could hinder him from imagining every man that looked upon her had a dishonourable design towards her, and also that she had no disinclination to encourage it. 
The whole of the entertainment concluded with a kind of ball; and as there were more gentlemen than ladies present, the cloudy husband, with two others, retired to one corner of the room, and sat drinking to the healths of those that danced. 
It was by mere accident, and without the least design on either side, that Jemmy had for his partner the wife of this suspicious gentleman;—but it was pleasant enough for those who sat near him to observe with what eagerness his eyes pursued each motion in them, which the regulation of the dance required,—how his colour changed,—how his lips trembled, whenever that couple set to each other, or turn'd hands; it was in vain they fill'd his glass and reminded him of the neglected toast, though it were even that of the royal family;—he thought of nothing but his wife, and seeing her, as he imagined, encouraging the dumb courtship of a person who would invade his rights, he had no longer patience, and the second dance was but just led up when he rose from his seat and said he must go home, for he had letters of importance to write, which till that moment he had forgot. 
This put all into disorder;—the gentleman who had made the invitation would fain have persuaded him to stay, but was silenced by the other, urging the necessity of his departure:—the lady then told him, with a great deal of politeness, that if they must be so unhappy to be deprived of his company, she hoped they should not also lose mrs.—, who she supposed had no letters to write. 
‘No,—no madam, replied he, with very great emotion, my wife may stay if she thinks proper; I do not want her, not I:’—she was advancing to take her leave while he was speaking, nor would suffer herself to be prevailed upon, by all the lady could say, to stay behind her husband; but it was easy for any one to see her inclinations took the contrary part, and denied herself the satisfaction such good company afforded, merely through the apprehensions of paying too dearly for it when she came home. 
Thus industriously do some people labour to bring on what most they would avoid;—if this lady had been possess'd of a little more beauty, or to speak more justly, had she been mistress of a less share of discretion, there were, doubtless, some in company who would have been excited, by the jealousy of her husband, to have attempted that chastity he took such ridiculous measures to preserve. 
As it was, however, the behaviour of the husband served to render him contemptible in the eyes of every one, and that of the wife to give her charms, which otherwise could not have been remark'd in her. 
The sarcasms pass'd on this unhappy self-tormented gentleman would be too tedious to repeat, yet were much shorter, than they otherwise would have been, if the music's sprightly sounds had not reminded the company, that their feet at that time demanded more employment than their tongues. 
It is not to be doubted but that on going home every one made their several remarks on what they had seen, but the mind of Jemmy was affected by it in a particular manner, as he considered all that had presented itself to him that day concurred to make up one great instructive lesson for himself.
