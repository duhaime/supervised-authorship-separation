The Passion which the Count had
profess'd for Emanuella, was too
sincere to be easily thrown off; and
tho' in his Circumstances, it was
wholly improper he should marry
without a Fortune; yet he could
not resolve to quit her without the utmost Reluctance
—The first Storm of Indignation which
the malicious Berillia had raised in his Soul, was
no sooner over, than a great part of his former
Tenderness return'd. He consider'd that what he
had heard was so inconsistent with her Character,
and with her Behaviour, that had it come from
the Mouth of any other Person, it would not have
found the least room in his Belief. Nor could he
even from her set it down for Truth, in spite of
the Improbability there appeared, that she should 

have any Design in deceiving him into an ill Opinion
of a Woman, whom he knew she had Reason
to Esteem—This Division in his Thoughts,
made him for some Days sufficiently disquieted. 
Nor was he a little amaz'd, and alarm'd, when
he was told that she was retir'd into a Monastery— 
This Proceeding, he thought vastly incongrouous
with the Account Berillia had given him of her
Humour; and he was at the greatest loss in the
World what Judgment to form—Fain would he
have writ—fain would he have made her a Visit
at the Grate of the Pourclairs; but the Promise her
Cousin had exacted from him, deferr'd him on
the one side; and on the other, the Reflection
that, in case she should be found innocent, he
should be obliged to renew those Pretensions,
which, as she now was, were no ways comformable
to his Ambition—However, he could not
restrain his Inclinations, which were yet very
tender to her, and, perhaps, might in time have
weighed down Interest, if a Chance had not happened
in his Affairs, which turn'd the Balance,
and prov'd how little Dependance there is on Man,
when Love and Gratitude are the only Motives to
engage his Constancy. 
He was one Morning in his Bed full of uneasy
and perplex'd Meditations, when his Servant
brought him a Letter, in which he found these
Lines: 

To Count Emilius.
That you have wronged me in the most tender
Part, I make no more doubt of, than that you
are a Man of Honour enough to endeavour a Defence
of what you have done. I desire therefore that
you will meet me an Hour hence in the Field of
St. Cruzada, either to repair the Injuries you have 

done me by your Life, or by depriving me of mine, put
an end to the just Resentment of 
Octavio. 

The Surprize with which Emilius read this
Challenge, was proportionable to the Occasion. 
He could not imagine for which of his Actions he
should be call'd to account by a Gentleman whom
he had scarce any knowledge of; whom he had
not seen above two or three times, and whom he
never had any particular Conversation with: But
bethinking himself what a Man of Honour ought
to do in such a Case, he ask'd if the person who
brought the Letter waited for an Answer; and
being told that he did, he call'd for Pen and Ink,
and immediately return'd one in this manner: 

To Don Octavio.
I should be very sorry to be guilty of an Injury to
any one; and am certain it is as distant from my
Power as Inclination, to have done any thing to you,
which cou'd justly occasion a Summons of the Nature
I have received: But since I am accus'd of it, am
ready to give you such Satisfaction as becomes a Gentleman; 
and to that end will attend you at that Time
and Place appointed; being no less desirous to know
the Reason which has made you my Enemy, than
you are to declare yourself one to 
Emilius. 

He had no sooner dispatch'd this, than he rose,
and making what haste he could to dress, was in
the Field little later than his Antagonist; whom,
as he came near, he found had his Sword ready
drawn, which oblig'd him to put himself also in a
Posture of Defence: But being unwilling to fight,
without knowing for what Cause—You see Don 

Octavio! said he, I have obey'd your Summons; 
but as I am yet unacquainted with the
Motive which induc'd you to send it, I desire you
will be just enough to inform me, before we engage. 
You feign an Ignorance (interrupted the other
fiercely) 'tis impossible you should not know,
that Rivalship in Love is what the Spanish Honour
cannot brook. —Were the adorable Julia less
worthy of my Passion, the long Addresses I have
made her would scorn to yield to any new Pretender
—therefore, defend the Wrong you have
had the Boldness to attempt, or tamely fall the
unworthy Victim of impatient Jealousy. 
These Words, and the Name of Julia, so
much surpriz'd the Count, that he could neither
answer them immediately, nor recollect himself
enough to parry the Thrust with which they were
accompany'd, and he receiv'd a slight Wound in
the Arm, and was very near suffering a second,
in a place, perhaps, more dangerous, before he
had regain'd Presence enough of Mind to avoid
it. But as his Surprize vanish'd, Indignation kindled
in his Soul, and he soon let the other know it
was not Fear which had rendred him thus long unactive; 
the Smart of the Wound rais'd him to an
equal Fury, and he forbore endeavouring to convince
the rash Octavio of his Mistake, 'till he
had punish'd his Unadvisedness. Being an excellent
Master of his Sword, he not only return'd
doubly the Wound he had receiv'd, but by disarming
him, rendered him incapable of giving
more; but his Rage diminishing with his Adversary's
Power, he generously return'd his Weapon,
desiring still they might be Friends, and that he
would explain what 'twas he meant by Rivalship,
and Julia; assuring him, that he had no design
on any Lady of that Name. Octavio, tho'
he had too much Honour to renew the Combat
with a Person whose Power it so lately had been 

to have taken his Life, gave him a Look which
sufficiently demonstrated the continued Rancour
of his Heart, and only telling him, that he knew
Julia too well to believe she cou'd love a Man
without being first belov'd by him, flung sullenly
away, leaving Emilius in a greater Consternation,
than his Behaviour had put him in before. 
He cou'd by no means comprehend the meaning
of this Adventure, nor from what Source the Jealousy
of Octavio had sprung. He had heard
much Talk of a Lady call'd Julia; but he had
never seen her, nor was he certain it was for her
sake all this had happened: but from that Moment
he received a secret Wish, that he were indeed
happy enough to be in that Lady's favour, whom
he had heard spoke of as one of the greatest Fortunes
in Madrid, and a celebrated Beauty. The
bare Conjecture that there was a possibility that
she might have seen and liked him, went a great
way towards the expelling his Passion for a Woman
he had already enjoy'd, and who now no longer
had it in her Power to conduce to the Gratification
of his Ambition. —He spent that whole
Day in Enquiries what sort of a Woman this Julia
was, how large her Fortune, and who they
were that had made Pretensions to her; and from
all Hands receiv'd such Accounts, as fill'd him
with ardent Longings, that Octavio's Jealousy
might have something more in it than an
imaginary Cause. He was told by some, who
seem'd to know a good deal of her Affairs, that
that Gentleman had for a long time profess'd himself
her Lover, but he had of late been deny'd
the Privilege of visiting her, tho' for what reason,
was yet a Secret; and these Tidings half confirm'd
the pleas'd Emilius, that he was more blest
than he cou'd have imagin'd. 
But, as to inform himself as much as possible
of the Truth of this Affair, took up the Day, the 

Night was employ'd in Contrivances how to make
the best Advantage of what had been told. He had
found out where she liv'd, and also that being an
Orphan, the Riches she was possess'd of were entirely
at her own Dispose; and nothing he thought
now remained for him to do, but to form some
pretty Stratagem, whereby he might become acquainted
with her, without appearing guilty of a
Boldness which might forfeit all the Kindness she
had for him. Few Men had been more fortunate
in Inventions of this Nature than himself; and
'tis scarce to be doubted, but that he would soon
have found one plausible enough for his purpose,
if he had not been spar'd the pains, by receiving
in the Morning a Billet of a far different kind than
that which had been brought him the Day before. 
The Contents of it were these. 

To Count Emilius.
Since we are taught, that of two Evils 'tis
best to chuse the least; to avoid being guilty of
Ingratitude, I am oblig'd to break through the Decorum
of my Sex, by writing to a Gentleman, to whom,
I believe, I am altogether a Stranger. 
For the Wound you have received on my account,
I can do no less in Honour than apply a Balsam; to
which end, I send you the most experienc'd Artist in
this Kingdom: And if the Punishment of the Offender
may be any Reparation for the Offence, give
you my solemn Promise the rash Octavio shall
dearly repent his Insolence, if I have any of that
Power over him be pretends. 
And tho' such an Invitation may be thought too
great a Freedom, I shall be glad to make you sensible
by Word of Mouth, as soon as you are in a Condition
to come abroad, how much I regret the Injury has
been done you. If a Person, so little qualified to merit 

your Conversation, has hitherto escap'd your Notice,
the Messenger, who brings this, can inform you
where you may know more of the Sentiments of 
Julia. 

After having mention'd the Inquietudes he
was in, to find a proper Method to introduce himself
to this Lady, 'twould be needless to express
the Pleasure this Letter gave him. He commanded
that the Person who brought it shou'd be
shew'd up into his Chamber; and finding he appear'd
like a Gentleman, used him in the most
handsome manner imaginable. The other soon
inform'd him, that he was a Surgeon, and that he
was order'd by Donna Julia de Venelli to
attend him with all possible diligence 'till his Wound
was cur'd. And tho' the Count assur'd him it was
but a Scratch, and unworthy his Regard, yet he
wou'd needs apply a Plaister to it; and pulling
out of his Pocket a Scarf made of Silver Gause,
and curiously embroider'd with Crimson and
Green, and a Locket to fasten it together, which
had a Cypher in it with the Letters of her Name
set round with Diamonds of a very great Value,
told him, she had sent him that to bind his Arm. — 
A Man of less Gallantry, and less Inclination to
be well in the Esteem of such a Lady as Donna
Julia, would scarce have refus'd so obliging a
Present; and it is easy to imagine, that he suffer'd
it to be put on with a Pleasure suitable to the Favour
of the Sender. He intreated him to stay,
and order'd a genteel Morning-Repast to be got
ready, while he withdrew to his Closet to answer
the welcome Billet, which he did in these
Words. 


To the most Excellent Donna Julia de Venelli.
A hurt so trifling as that which I received
from the Hand of Don Octavio requir'd not
a Balsam of that Divine Nature your Goodness has
bestow'd,—You rather, Madam! should have reserv'd
your Pity for those Wounds the Fame of your
Accomplishments has already made but too deep, and
which (I had almost said I fear) your Eyes will render
incurable, but by Death, or a Condescension, such
as 'twou'd be the utmost Vanity to hope—But
whatever Destiny you inflict, cannot but be glorious; 
and certainly, the next Blessing to the Heaven
of living in your Favour, would be dying in the Pursuit
of it. 
I wear, most angelick of your Sex! the justest
Sense of your unmerited Favours at my Heart, and
your admirable Scarf on my Arm; which tho' it infuses
not Pains of the same Nature as those of Hercules's
Shirt, will differ but little in their Consequence,
if ever you should discontinue to allow me
the Effects of that Infinity of Mercy you seem at present
possest of, and refuse me the Privilege of avowing
that I am 
The Divine Julia's
Everlasting Slave,
Emilius. 
P.S.
If the Sword of Octavio had emptied my Veins
of the best part of their Blood, that Tide of Extasy
you have inspired me with, would fill them up again,
and give a nobler Life, and added Vigour, to bear 

me to your Feet with bumblest Gratitude and sublimest
Joys. —Delay then my impatient Wishes no longer,
this Day permit me to offer up my Soul, an Oblation
worthy of your Acceptation, no otherwise than
by its Sincerity. 

The Surgeon, who easily guess'd at the
Lady's meaning who had sent him, went away
perfectly pleased that he should be able to give
her an Account of Emilius's Behaviour, which
he knew would be so much to her Satisfaction. 
And the Count extreamly lifted up at this unexpected
Turn of good Fortune, forgot every thing
in the Contemplation of the Advantages he should
enjoy in marrying a Woman of Donna Julia's
Quality and Estate; which that it was in his power
to do, he might very well suppose, when she had
made him such Advances. It is not to be doubted
but that he took all possible Care in the dressing
himself that Day, to secure the Conquest he had
gain'd; and having no Orders to make a Secret
of his Visit to her, he went into his Chariot attended
by two running Footmen, and four others
all in rich Liveries—But alas! there needed not
all this Pomp to engage the already enamour'd
Julia: She had for a long time been the Slave
of Love; she ador'd the charming Count from the
first Moment she beheld him, which happen'd to
be at Church soon after his Arrival; and after
many fruitless Endeavours to become acquainted
with him, and hearing of his Engagements with
Emanuella, she fell into a Melancholy, which
had like to have cost her her Life—Don Octavio
had made his Addresses to her for many
Months, and at first flatter'd himself with hopes
of Success; but perceiving a sudden Alteration in
her Humour, immediately imagined it to proceed
from the Love of some other Person: And not
able to discover any thing of the Truth, he at last 

found means by bribing a Priest (for what will
not Gold influence the Minds of some People to!)
to get into the Confessional Chair at the time
when she was to come to confess; and by telling
her that her Melancholy, if not caused by
some spiritual Remorse for any Faults she might
have been guilty of, was sinful; and if she did
not disburden herself to her ghostly Father, and
endeavour by Works of Penance to merit Absolution,
her Case was more desperate than she was
aware of; frighted her so, being naturally pretty
much bigotted to the Religion she had been educated
in, that she presently confess'd she was in
Love. With whom? (cry'd out the pretended Father)
for if it be a Person worthy of you, I will
undertake to make you happy with him. To
which again she as innocently as before answer'd,
Emilius, a Roman Count lately arriv'd at Madrid
—She had said more, but the Lover could
no longer counterfeit the Priest; he threw off his
Disguise, and showing himself to be Octavio,
upbraided her Ingratitude and Falshood, as he
term'd it, and vow'd Revenge on his happy Rival
—It was in vain she endeavour'd to deter
him, by threatning him with those Penalties the
Law inflicts on all who dare to prophane the Sacrament
of Confession in the manner he had done. 
His Rage was deaf to to all Considerations, either
of himself, or the Priest who had assisted him in
this Stratagem; and he left her in the Church,
to ruminate on what had happen'd, while he
went and prepared a Challenge for Emilius, as
has been before related—It is not to be supposed
but she had Spies to observe his Motions; but
they were either too careless of the Injunction
laid on them, or too late to prevent him from
fighting with the Count: But they brought her Intelligence
of all that had happen'd; and since
there was no Mischief on either Side, she was not 

a little contented that she had so good a Pretence
to write to Emilius. Nor after she had received
his Answer, can we imagine she was less diligent
in making herself appear as amiable as possible,
than he had been. Not only her own Person, but
her House and Servants were all set forth to the
best Advantage, and every thing seem'd so rich,
so fine, so neat, that by the care that was used in
making it so, the expected Guest might easily perceive
how welcome a one he was. 
The mutual Desire each had to please the other,
very much heighten'd the Graces of them both— 
Julia had a Face and Shape to which Nature
had been so extreamly indulgent, that she stood
but little in need of any Aids from Art; but having
had Recourse to all that even the most curious
had invented, joined to the Pleasure which
sparkled in her Eyes, at sight of an Object she had
so long and so ardently languish'd to behold, her
Beauty appeared with such an Illustration, as requir'd
a Heart better fortified with Constancy than
was that of Emilius to withstand its Charms. 
And tho' as handsome as she was, she was by many
degrees far less attractive than the abandon'd
Emanuella; yet he imagined her infinitely
more so—O the enchantments of Novelty!
the Delights there are in having something to subdue
—the pleasing Fears—the sweet
Hopes,—the tender Anxieties—the thousand
nameless, soft Perplexities which fill the roving
Soul of Man when in pursuit of a new Conquest!
but after Possession are no more remembred— 
Then cold Civility succeeds tumultuous Transport— 
When present, forc'd Compliments supply the place
of Ardor; when absent, curs'd Indifference that of
impatient Longings—and dull insipid Gratitude
is all the yielding Fair can hope for, even from the
best of Men. Emilius now thought he had
never seen any thing so lovely as Julia, and 

immediately became possess'd with as much real
Passion for her, as a Heart could be, so liable to
Mutability as his was. Love and Wit inspir'd him
with a thousand engaging Softnesses, which she,
eager to credit what she wish'd, believ'd; and tho'
she had heard a vast deal of his Pretensions to
Emanuella, she now imagined him so intirely
her own, that it never would he in the power of
any other Face to make the least Alteration in his
Sentiments to her disadvantage—She lov'd with
too sincere and passionate a Flame to be able to
disguise it; and what she confess'd not in Words,
her Eyes sufficiently inform'd him, and he reaped
all the Satisfaction he could hope from this first
Visit—He had her Leave to declare himself
her Servant—She promised to discharge all others
that pretended to that Title—and let him
know enough of her Inclinations to sooth Imagination
with a belief she would in a short time be
brought to yield to all he wish'd—Resolving by
his Assiduity to render himself worthy of the Favours
he had receiv'd, he waited on her every day,
and they were scarce ever asunder but in those
Hours which Decency required. 
There was nothing of this Affair a Secret; 
the Jealousy of Octavio, the publick Visits of
Emilius, and the undissembled Condescensions
of the Lady, engross'd the whole Discourse of the
Town. But what became of Emanuella when
she sheard this News, to whom the ill-natur'd Berjllia
immediately convey'd it in the worst and
most distracting Description her Malice could invent! 
She doubted not of his Coldness and Ingratitude
before, by the implicit Faith she put in
that Wretch who had so cruelly betray'd her; but
now to be told, to be assur'd, with a Million of
aggravating Circumstances, that he profer'd to another
all those Soul-attracting Protestations by which
she had been deceiv'd—to know another was 

in possession of all those Tendernesses—those
soft Endearments—those transporting Fondnesses
that once she thought were her's for ever, gave
her Agonies, too terrible to be conceiv'd but
by those who have felt the same: Yet, in spite of
all she endur'd, she still maintaining her Resolution,
of never seeing or writing to him more, firm
and unshaken; and the more she heard of his
Perfidiousness, the more she thought it beneath
her to take notice of it. 
But while she was indulging her Despair for
the many Misfortunes which had already befallen
her, Don Jabin, and his Lady, who were extreamly
sincere in their Professions of Friendship
to her, were labouring all they could for her Service. 
They had a very great Interest with the
Chief of the Nobility, and were so industrious
in exerting it, that the Case of this distress'd Lady
being represented to his Majesty's Consideration
in terms the most prevailing, engag'd him to command
that Don Pedro, who was yet at Madrid,
should out of his own Estate make up some part
of the Losses she had sustained; which tho' hapning
by the uncertainty of the Sea, were primarily
occasioned by him, in refusing to bring over
her Effects in a more favourable Season. The
avaricious old Monster had no way to avoid this
Decree; and the Grief of being obliged to obey it,
together with the Stings he felt in his Conscience
for the many Crimes he had been guilty of, threw
him a second time into a Fit of raging Madness,
of which in a few Weeks he died unpitied
by the whole World. The Provision which
by the King's Order he had made for Emanuella,
gave her kind Relations hope, that they
should have her among them again, and they
omitted no Persuasions, that she would quit that
austere Life, and return to the World again; but
she had Griefs which were not in Compass of 

their power, to remedy, she could not endure to
think of living where there was the least Probability
of seeing the false Emilius; and all that
was said to move her to the contrary, was no more
than throwing Water against the Wind. Don
Jabin and his Wife were both of them extreamly
troubled, that all they had done for her was ineffectual
to restore her to her former Chearfulness; 
but perceiving that their Endeavours to dissuade
her from a monastick Life, serv'd only to
increase her Obstinacy of persisting in it; they at
length gave her over, not without a Belief that
the Severities of that Order she had an Intention
to embrace, would oblige her to change her Mind
long before her Year of Probation was expired; 
and that she would in a little time be as impatient
to quit the Convent, as now she appeared at being
persuaded to it. 
These good People were not deceived in
their Conjectures; they soon saw the Effect they
guessed, though longer ignorant of the Cause. — 
In a much less space of time than they imagined,
Emanuella indeed wish'd her self in any Place,
rather than that in which she was; but the Motive
which induc'd her to that Desire, nay, inforc'd
her to a Necessity of it, was of a nature so shocking,
so terrible to be born, that it requires a Pen
infinitely more skill'd in Description than mine,
to represent a Condition of so consummate a
Misery. 
It was not many Weeks since she had been
among the Pourciairs, and in that time had not so
much as once thought of the Consequence, which
in all probability might attend the guilty Condescensions,
her Excess of Passion had yielded to Emilius:
But now the Hour was come which was
to make her know, that all she had endur'd from
the Cruelty of Don Pedro—from the Loss of
her Fortune—from the Ingratitude and Falshood 

of the Man she lov'd, were trifling Woes in competition
with those in store for her—She
found she was now destined to go through all that
can be conceived of Shame—of Misery—of
Horror—in fine, she found herself with Child!— 
with Child without a Husband!—with Child by
a Man who she had heard from all hands was going
to be married to another!—and what was
yet worse, by a Man whom she accounted the vilest,
and most perfidious of his Sex! —What Words— 
nay, what Imagination can paint out her Distress
as it deserves! —She was infinitely more wretched
than any other Woman would have been in
the like Circumstances, by the Addition of a superior
Understanding—and the Greatness of her
Spirit, and that Fortitude which had so well enabled
her to bear all other Misfortunes, serv'd her
but to encrease the Misery of her Condition, and
prevent her from stooping to those Measures by
which she alone could hope to secure her Reputation,
and screen what had happen'd from the
Knowledge of a censorious and unpitying World. 
Had she now written to the Connt, there was a
Possibility, that in spite of his new Passion for
Donna Julia, all might have been well; his
former Tenderness on the Eclaircisment of her
Innocence, and the Treachery of Berillia,
might, perhaps have return'd: Or if not so, which
indeed after Enjoyment could not be much expected; 
yet Honour and Gratitude would at least
have obliged him to protect and support her in
those Miseries, to which her Love for him had
reduc'd her: But this was an Expedient she could
not bear even to think on; and as often as it came
into her Mind, she would reject it with all the
Contempt imaginable—What (said she) shall
I descend to ask a Favour from the Man to
whom I owe my Ruin? —Shall I, forgetful
of my Wrongs, submit to be obliged to that cursed 

Villain?—that insolent Disdainer of my Truth
and Tenderness? No, rather let me suffer all the
Plagues that Heaven can inflict, or Flesh endure— 
Let me be driven to Want, to Beggary—exposed
to publick Infamy, the Sport of every Slave— 
or tarrying here, be buried quick—it will be a
less Shock—less Horror than an Obligation to
that intolerable Fiend!—the hated, loath'd Emilius! 
Thus did the Haughtiness of her Soul, and
fatal Consciousness, how little she had deserved the
Treatment she had found, suggest. Nor was her
Resentment less pernicious to her than her Modesty; 
for as the one prevented her from making any
Discovery to the Count, so did the other also deprive
her of the Power of uttering the least Hint
of this Affair to Don Jabin or his Lady. Berillia
was the only Person to whom she could
persuade herselfto reveal it: but Heaven had by this
time began to inflict on that false Creature some part
of the Punishments her base Actions merited; her
criminal Amour had by some means come to her
Father's knowledge, and he had sent her under the
care of an old Servant into the Country, far from
Madrid, and the Conversation of her Lover; tho'
had she been in the way of being intrusted, 'tis
little probable she would have been of any service:
But Emanuella, who suspected not her Perfidy,
received a considerable Addition to her Sorrows,
by being told she was gone. Pity is a prodigious
Alleviator of Affliction, the most violent Grief
finds some Ease in complaining; but when our
Woes are of a nature as will not admit revealing,
they prey on our very Vitals, waste the Spirits
with unintermitting Anguish! and seldom fail of
bringing on Death or Distraction. Nothing was
ever more deserving wonder, than that this wretched
Lady did not lay violent hands on her own Life:
but tho' she wish'd to die, she forbore being guilty
of that Act of Horror: Whenever the Confusion 

of her Thoughts permitted her the power of Consideration,
she would begin to cast about what
Course to take; but then the Impossibility there
seem'd of her being able to find any, whereby she
might conceal her Shame, plunged her afresh into
Disorders, which at some times were very little
different from Madness. The Cruelties she inflicted
on herself in private, such as tearing her Hair
and Flesh, fasting, passing whole Nights together
on the Floor; and instead of Rest, giving her self
wholly up to the bitter Anguish of her Soul, would be
too tedious, and too melancholy an Account! How
terribly she was abandon'd to Despair; and how
little she regarded what might befall her, is evident,
when the Effects of her now dearly repented
Passion, began to grow too great for Concealment. 
Taking the Opportunity of the Nunnery
being on some Occasion open, she went out in
the Habit she was in, without having taken any
thought where to go, or to whom she should apply; 
it was pretty late in the Evening, and the
Dusk favour'd her from being taken any notice of; 
till coming into a great Street where were many
Passengers, the sight of them at a distance gave
her so much of Thought, as to be apprehensive
of being seen, and known; the Cathedral Church
therefore of our Lady being near, she stepped into
the Porch, and sitting down in a corner of it, by
that means conceal'd herself from the Observation
of any body: But what avail'd it, that when the
Darkness coming on, the Streets were intirely
free, she could direct her Steps to no Place, but
where either Shame, or the height of her Spirit
would not suffer her to go: yet still keeping up
her Resolution, that whatever became of her, and
whatever should be the Consequence of her wandering,
she never would consent to receive the
smallest Shelter or Protection from the ungrateful
Emilius; she lest her Covert, and began her Journey, 

tho' she was insensible where she went, and wholly
incapable of designing any thing: Chance therefore
it was which guided her to that part of the Town
which led into the great Road to a Village called
Aine: The Knowledge where she now was, for
being unaccustomed to walk, made her but little
acquainted with the Streets, gave her a kind of a
sullen Satisfaction; she car'd not whither she went,
so she went out of Madrid; and the force of that
Desire, strengthen'd her to get a good way from
it, before she found herself incapable of going
farther: But at last, Weariness and Faintness got
the better of Inclination; she could no longer
pursue her Pilgrimage, and was constrained to lie
down to take such Rest as she could in the
High-way—To add to her present Hardship,
which considering the Condition she was in, was
such as no Woman but herself, perhaps, ever
sustained with Life; it began to rain so excessively,
that in a very few Minutes she was wet to the Skin; 
the Shower was succeeded by a Storm of Wind,
and such dreadful Claps of Thunder, as might have
struck the most couragious Heart with Dread— 
But not all the Horrors of this Hurricane, made
more terrible by the darkness of the Night, and
the forlorn Silence of the Place—Not all she
endur'd from its Fury, had the power to make
her recede from that Resolution she had form'd,
or wish for Shelter from Emilius. But in the
midst of this dismal Scene, Fortune seem'd to offer
her a Gleam of Comfort, as she was lying, her
tender Limbs exposed to all the Rage of the unpitying
Elements, and pouring forth Tears almost
as fast as the Sky did Rain; she perceiv'd, when
she least expected it, a Light which seem'd to
be in a House not far off. She had so much of
Self-Preservation left, as to endeavour to make up
to it, which with much ado, numb'd and faint as
as she was, she did at last; she found it as she 

wish'd, a little Cottage, for had it been any other,
she would rather have continued as she was, than
gone to ask Relief where there was a Probability
of being known. The poor good Woman of it,
who was sitting up tending a sick Child, receiv'd
her with as much Hospitality as the Place and her
Circumstances would afford: She pluck'd off her
wet Clothes, and gave her a Gown of her own
to put on, made a Fire, and brought her the best
Refreshments she had. —But alas! the discontented
Emanuella was little capable of tasting any; 
which her kind Hostess perceiving, and guessing by
her Garb and Mien that she was a Person little accustomed
to such Hardships, intreated to know
what had occasioned her travelling alone on foot,
and at such a dreadful Hour and Season. This Enquiry
threw her unhappy Guest into such Returns
of over-pressing Grief, that it was a long time before
she could make any Answer; but when she
had enough recovered herself to do it, she told her
the truth of her having made her Escape from the
Monastery, only concealing the Reasons why she
did so, and her Name: But the Woman having
had many Children herself, suspected the former,
and pitied her extreamly; she would fain have
persuaded her to go to Bed, but the other would
not consent; and only throwing herself cross it,
she pass'd the remainder of the Night in most bitter
Lamentations. When Morning came, she begg'd
that she might have those Clothes which had been
lent her, believing it might serve as a sufficient Difguise,
if by any Accident she should be seen by any
that knew her; and told the Woman, she should
not only have hers in Exchange, but some Money
to boot. —To which the other willingly consented,
not only because of her own Profit, but
also that believing she was about to prosecute a
Journey in which she might be pursued, they might
be of service to her. Our unfortunate Traveller 

felt as much Pleasure at this Opportunity of transmographying
herself, as was consistent with her
Condition; and designing to go yet farther from
Madrid, took her Leave. The extream Dirt of
the Road made it impossible for her Feet, unused
to tread such Ground, to bear her as fast as her
Desires would have carried her; but in spite of all
she still went on, and without making any stop
either to eat or drink, till that day was almost spent. 
Evening coming on, she went into an Inn, believing
now she was far enough from Discovery— 
Nature beginning to accuse her that she had acted
an inhuman Part to the unborn Innocent within
her, who bore its share in all the Hardships she
endured; she order'd something to be got ready
for her to eat, of which having taken as much as
her distracted Thoughts would give her leave to
do, she went to Bed, and endeavour'd to compose
herself. —The extream Weakness she was in,
overcoming all those Perturbations which had so
long kept her waking, she fell into a sound Sleep,
and in the Morning found her Mind as well as Body
had been very much refresh'd by it. —She
began to consider seriously what it was best for her
to do; and that natural Vivacity and Spirit, which
had already carried her through so many Difficulties,
now by degrees returning, gave her hopes
she should also get through this, with less Trouble
than her Despair had at first suggested—and
resolving to run no farther into Inconveniencies,
such as she had pass'd in that little Time since she
had left the Monastery, she hir'd a couple of Mules
and a Guide to conduct her to the next Town,
which she was inform'd was Alcala: From that
she design'd for Guadalaxara, because she thought
the other not so far distant from Madrid, but that
Don Jabin, to whom there was a Necessity she
must send for Money, might send some Person to
know the Reasons of her coming away in so strange 

a manner. —Reason having now regain'd its
force, she no sooner had formed this Design, than
she began to put it in execution; and the People
of the House furnishing her with Mules and a Guide,
she got safely to Alcala, and from thence to Guadalaxara,
without any thing happening in her Journey
worthy of Remark; unless it were that she,
who but a day or two before had so wholly given
herself up to Despair, that she seem'd to dare all
kind of Miseries, now appeared as careful of her
Life, as before she had been the contrary: But
this will not be thought strange by any one, who
considers how impossible it is for the Excess of any
Passion to continue; a weak Constitution, accompanied
by a mean Judgment, it immediately destroys,
and Death or Madness is the Consequence,
as it happened in the Case of Don Pedro. But
Emanuella had a more than ordinary Strength
as well of Nature as of Reason, to struggle with
the Torrent of her, for a time, impetuous Grief; 
which at last enabled her to overcome it, at least
so far as 'twas requisite for Self-preservation, of
which for a time she had seem'd wholly regardless. 
When she was arrived at Guadalaxara, she
took Lodgings in a private House; pretending
that she had a Husband whom she expecte'd to follow
her in a little time; and to prevent all possibility
of a Discovery, told the People her Name
was Mercina. She took the same prudent Care
also in the Directions she sent to Don Jabin,
writing to him in this manner: 


To Don Jabin.
The many Proofs I have received of your Friendship,
would oblige me to conceal nothing from you,
were there no other Person but my self concerned
—I entreat, therefore, that you will believe
I made a Secret of leaving the Pourclairs not out of
Choice, but Necessity; and as such, vouchsafe to pardon
it. —My Affairs requiring an immediate
Supply of Money, I beg you will remit in Bills to the
value of about two Hundred Crowns, and direct them
to be receiv'd by Donna Mercina, at Guadalaxara,
near which place I am; that Lady is my particular
Friend, and will not fail to do me Justice in the Trust
I repose in her—I desire also that you will write
under a Cover to her, an Account of your's and your good
Family's Welfare, for which I shall ever most ardently
petition Heaven; being (however my present Circumstances
may oblige me to appear the contrary) in the
sincerest manner, 
Don Jabin's
Most affectionate Kinswoman,
and devoted Servant,
Emanuella. 
P. S. I doubt not but your accustomed Goodness
will still extend it self so far in my favour, as to silence
whatever Aspersions may happen to be cast on my
leaving the Monastery so suddenly, by seeming to have
been privy to it, and that it was for no other Reason
than the too great Severities practised by that Order. 


She might have omitted this last Request: She
was no sooner miss'd, than the true Reason of her
Departure was blazed abroad. One of the Nuns,
being more quick-sighted than the rest, had discovered
her Condition; and after she was gone, related
it to the whole Convent. What is in the
Mouths of such a Number, especially of that Sex,
which is seldom bless'd with Secrecy, and of that
Sort too who have little else to employ their time
with, cannot be expected to be with-held from the
knowledge of all who have any Conversation with
them. Emilius among the rest was inform'd
of it, which very much help'd to confirm him in
the Opinion that all Berillia had said concerning
her Conduct was true: Judging of her Actions
by that of the generality of Women, few of whom
would have known themselves to be in the Circumstance
she was, without acquainting the Person
chiefly obliged to pity, with the Misfortune— 
He doubted not therefore but that it had happened
by him, whom that Monster of Treachery had
told him had supplanted him in her Affections,
and that that was the Reason she had never written
to upbraid the Change of his Humour in his
Addresses to Julia, as he imagined she would
have done, if she had been innocent herself. — 
And these Conjectures, which tho' in reality the
most injurious that could be, appeared so reasonable,
that they entirely destroy'd all those small
Remains of Tenderness, his new Desire for an
Object yet unenjoy'd, had left him: And now
entirely devoted to Julia, and to the Advantages
he proposed by marrying her, left nothing undone
which might engage her to consent. —She
who was half won before-hand, and had only made
some faint Denials for Form's sake, easily suffered
herself to seem over-persuaded to follow her Inclinations,
and they were married in great Solemnity, 

in a very little time after Emanuella had departed
from Madrid. 
But Don Jabin, who had but too true a guess
at the State of her Affairs, and made no doubt but
that Emilius was the Man to whom she ow'd
her Undoing, forbore to aggravate her Afflictions
by sending her any Intelligence either of what was
talk'd of concerning her self, or of the Marriage
of her Lover: But sending her the Money which
she desir'd, and which he easily believ'd she wanted,
writ no more to her, than to entreat she would
continue to let him hear from her; and that as
soon as her Affairs would permit, she would return
to Madrid. 
This Supply, and the Belief that every Body
she had left behind her, were as entirely ignorant
of her Circumstances as she could wish, made her
as easy in them, as could possibly be expected. 
Her Courage and usual Fortitude now, with such
Success exerted themselves, that she waited the
dreadful Hour, which she knew was shortly to arrive,
with all the Resignation and Patience imaginable; 
and at the appointed time brought a Son
into the World, who, from the Moment of his
Birth, seem'd to promise he would be an Ornament
to it. 
I am of Opinion, that the greatest part of my
Female Perusers, will imagine this unfortunate
Lady could regard a Child, whose begetting had
cost her so many Tears, but with Indifference, and
that she must have look'd on him with more Remorse
than Tenderness; but Emanuella, as
most of her Notions were vastly different from
those of the generality of her Sex, so were they
also in this. Had the Ceremony of the Church
made Emilius as much her Husband, as by
his Vows he ought to have acknowledg'd himself; 
and had he never swerv'd in the least tittle from
that Constancy he had sworn to maintain inviolable, 

or that Ardency of Passion which he once
profess'd, she could not have lov'd his Son with
greater Fondness—Never did maternal Tenderness
reach to a height more elevated than her's— 
A thousand Lives she would have thought well
given to have preserv'd this Darling of her Soul— 
All the Ignominy which this Adventure, if divulg'd,
would bring upon her, was now no longer a Concern
to her—Even Virtue was become less dear; 
and she could scarce repent she had been guilty of
a Breach of it, so much she priz'd the Effect— 
and it would only have been with Transports of
unconceivable Affection she had beheld the lovely
Babe, if the Reflection how little it was in her
power to do for him, had not sometimes given
a check to the Pleasure she took in calling him
her own. —She felt, indeed, all the Mother's Joy,
but with it infinitely more Care than ordinarily
attends that Title, and was, as it were, divided
in her Thoughts between excess of Rapture, and
excess of Pain. —But however severe the intervals
of the latter might be, she was sufficiently invigorated
by the former, to be able to sustain them; 
and while she had her dear-lov'd Infant in her
Arms, and uninterrupted, gaz'd upon his growing
Beauties, nor felt immediate want of any Necessary
either for him or herself, she had not the
power to think too deeply of what future Miseries
might befall her; but her ever-varying Fortune,
which would not suffer her to continue long in any
settled State of Life, made a sudden Change in
her Affairs, which obliged her to other Considerations
than those which at present took up her
Mind. 
The ungrateful Berillia, who, as I have
before taken notice, had been sent from Madrid
under the Government of a Duenna, some little time
before Emanuella left the Pourclairs; where
she was carried, was kept a Secret to every Body; 

for the Cause of her being banished her Father's
House, being her Intrigue with a Person he could
not approve, he resolv'd to take the most prudent
Measures that he could, to prevent the place of
her Retirement being discover'd. The Person in
whose Charge she was intrusted, had a Sister who
liv'd at a small Village call'd Tortol, within a short
Mile of Guadalaxara, and there she was to be conceal'd
for some time. He had as good as made
an Agreement for her going into the Convent of
Franciscans; but as he could not be certain, but
that she might be in the same Circumstances with
her unfortunate Cousin, he was willing to be convinced
to the contrary, before her Entrance; and
for that purpose plac'd her at this Distance from
Madrid, where whatever happen'd might be conceal'd. 
The Place where she was kept being so
near Guadalaxara, he writ to Morena, for that
was the Name of her who was appointed Guardian
over his Daughter, to make a little Journey
thither. He order'd her to enquire for a Woman
call'd Mercina, and endeavour by her means,
if possible, to come to the Speech of Emanuella; 
but if that could not be accomplish'd, to
inform herself of the Truth of her Affairs, and
give him an Account. This Letter happening to
be brought when Morena was out of the way
on some Business, Berillia took it in; and
knowing it to be her Father's Hand, broke it open. 
—She had, ever since she had been there,
thought of nothing, but how she should get away:
and was over joy'd to find Emanuella was so
near, resolving to take this Opportunity of making
her Escape to her, not doubting but the Power
the other's mistaken Friendship had given her over
her, would furnish her with Arguments to prevail
on her to act according to her Desires. She
was kept entirely without Money; and the Belief
that she was far from any Body who either could 

or would furnish her with means of making an
Escape, in case she should desire it, made her be
watched with much less Circumspection than
otherwise she would have been; and she had an
Opportunity to go out of the House the very Day
she had intercepted the Letter. The Weather favour'd
her Design, and it being but a small Walk
to Guadalaxara, she easily reach'd it before
Sun-set. 
Emanuella had not yet recover'd Strength
enough to rise, and was prodigiously surpriz'd
when she was told a Lady of a good Appearance
enquir'd for Donna Mercina, and would not
be deny'd the Privilege of speaking with her. — 
She had contracted no Acquaintance in that Place,
and could not imagine on what account a Stranger
should seem so pressing to see her. —But the
People of the House acquainting her that they had
already made all the Excuses they could for the
Condition she was in, and that every thing was
ineffectual to get rid of her, she was at last oblig'd
to give leave for her Admittance. The Room
was made pretty dark, and the Bed-Curtains clos'd,
as is usual in such Cases: So that Berillia
could not discern who it was she was about to
speak to; but desiring that all who were in the
Room might leave it, she address'd her in this
manner: Donna Mercina, said she, there is
but one Excuse I can alledge for this Intrusion, but
that I hope will be a sufficient one: I doubt not
but you are acquainted with the Force of Friendship,
and will not think it strange that to prove
its Sincerity will carry one to greater lengths than
this—I am inform'd it is in your power to let
me know where I may find Donna Emanuella,
a Daughter of the late Governor of Porto-Rico. 
Never was there a more tender Regard between
Persons of the same Sex, than that which my Soul
paid to this Lady, and which I flatter my self I 

was favour'd with from her; but some Accidents
have for a long time depriv'd me of the Blessing
of her Conversation; nor 'till this Day, could I
for many Months get the least Intelligence in what
Part of the World it was I might hope to find
her—I intreat you therefore to direct my Search— 
I am satisfied she will not take it ill when you shall
tell her it is to Berillia, her Cousin and her Friend,
that you have made this Condescension—The
Astonishment that Emanuella was in, to find
it was she (for she immediately knew her Voice)
kept her from interrupting her 'till she came to
these Words; but then the Joy she felt at this Recovery
of a Friend so long lost, and whom she
thought so perfectly in her Interest, broke out in
these Expressions—Can it be possible! cry'd she,
throwing open the Curtains, has Heaven in compassion
of my Sufferings sent my dear Berillia to
me? —Come to my Arms, my best, my only
Friend! Emanuella will ever bless the Day
which brought thee here—'Tis on thy faithful
Breast I may pour out the secret Anguish of my
Soul—'Tis from thee I may assure my self of
both Advice and Consolation—Thou who Lovest
will Pity me. —A thousand such like Demonstrations
of the sincerest Welcome she did give
her, which the other return'd (as soon as the Consternation,
at the finding her so much sooner than
she expected, was a little over) with all the seeming
Truth, and tenderest Love imaginable: And
what was yet more obliging to her than any thing
she could say to herself, she kiss'd and embrac'd
the Child with an Ardour so like Sincerity, that
one who had less Confidence in her might easily
have mistook for it. When the first Raptures of
this meeting would permit them to talk of Business,
they began to relate to each other all the
Particulars of their Adventures since last they parted:
But when Emanuella heard by what 

means Berillia had been directed to enquire
for her, and had read the Letter Don Jabin had
sent to Morena, she found she had but flatter'd
herself with an Opinion that the Cause of
her removal from Madrid had been a Secret, and
could not forbear expressing how nearly she was
touch'd at the loss of that Reputation she had taken
so much pains to preserve. And this Regret
was of excellent service to further a Contrivance
which the wicked Berillia had form'd. She
presently began to dissuade her from all thoughts
of ever returning to Madrid: Nor, said she, since
Don Jabin is so diligent in his Inquiries, can
you be any longer in private here; tho' I have
been so fortunate in intercepting one Letter, he
will undoubtedly write again—Morena knows
you, and in the Person of Mercina will Emanuella
be discover'd, and every Circumstance
of this Affair related. I would advise you, since,
when one is determined to be conceal'd, all Places
are alike, to call in what Money you have in my
Father's Hands, and quitting Guadalaxara with all
possible Expedition, settle in some other Town. — 
For my part, if I had less reason to fly from a
Father from whom I now no more can hope for
Favour, my love for you will oblige me to banish
all other Considerations, and continue with you
'till Death enforces a Separation. —The again
deceiv'd Emanuella highly approv'd of this
Advice, and thank'd her for it, and for the Offer
she made of living with her, in Terms which the
Intentions of the other were far from meriting. 
Since she had resolv'd to proceed in this manner,
the other reminded her, that she must not delay
it; because if they tarried till the Account of her
making her Escape from Morena were sent to
her Father, it might possibly make him suspect
his Letter had fallen into her Hands, and that
they were together. —Nothing could be more 

natural that this Supposition; and for that reason
Emanuella dispatch'd a Letter to him
immediately with a demand of a thousand Crowns,
that being the best part of what was her Due; 
not doubting but by the time it would come to
her Hands, she should be able to take a Journey. 
Berillia also writ a Letter at the same time to
her Lover, but the Contents of it she took care
to conceal from her Cousin, only telling her it
was to upbraid him for the many Misfortunes her
Passion for him had occasion'd her. After the
Letters were gone, and they had concluded on
every thing proper for their Expedition, they began
to make what Preparations they could for it,
that when the Answers should come, they might
have nothing to do, but to depart. —Emanuella
had her young Son baptized by the Name
of Victorinus: A Nurse was provided for
him, whose Circumstances would permit her to go
with them to any Place they should make choice
of; Mules and a Man-Servant to attend them were
hired, and every thing contriv'd, so as to be ready
at a Moment's Warning. 
How unkindly soever Don Jabin might take
it, that Emanuella, who ow'd the being Mistress
of so much Money wholly to his Intercession,
seem'd to think him unworthy of her Confidence,
which way she design'd to dispose either of
that or herself, he did not fail to send it: and
tho' her good Sense and the Gratitude of her Nature,
gave her some Shocks at treating him in
this manner; yet the Artifice of the Treacherous
Berillia, join'd to the innumerable Perplexities
of her Mind, prevented them from taking so
great Root in her Reflections, as otherwise they
would have done. 
Alcala was the Place they had agreed to go
to, not only because they were both of them entirely
unknown to any Body there, but also, that 

it being famous for Learning, Emanuella
thought the young Victorinus, when he
grew up fit to receive it, might have all the Advantages
of it, without her being oblig'd to send
him from her sight; a Misfortune, which her
Tenderness for him made appear to be the most
dreadful that cou'd possibly befall her: And tho'
it being much nearer to Madrid than the Place
they were in, yet both of them resolving to take
up other Names, they might live there with as
little danger of Discovery as in any other City. 
It being Evening when they set out, they lay
that Night at an Inn about the mid-way: Emanuella,
who was too fond of her little Victorinus
to suffer him to be one Moment from
her sight, would needs have his Nurse the Partner
of her Bed, and Berillia had one to herself
in another Chamber. Tho' on vastly different
Subjects, both these Ladies had sufficient to
employ their Minds. —One pass'd away the
restless Hours in Contemplation on the many
turns of Fortune she had known, and in imploring
Heaven, that where she now was going she might
find a Settlement for Life. —The other was applauding
her good Genius, for furnishing her with
Artifice to bring about almost whatever she undertook; 
and flattering herself with a thousand
Joys in store, all owing to her own Wit, her own
Fertility of Invention, and Perfection in the Art
of Dissimulation. 
It was very early in the Morning when Emanuella
rose, and having order'd the Mules to be
got ready, went herself to awake her Cousin; but
was not a little surpriz'd, when coming into her
Chamber, she was already up, and gone out: however,
imagining no more than that, not able to
sleep, she had rose, and was gone to take a walk
either in the Fields or Garden, bade one of the
Servants of the House to call her—O Heaven! 

said the Fellow to whom she gave this Command, do
you not know, that the Lady who last Night came
with you is gone? —Gone! cry'd she, what
mean you? She can be gone no farther than to
take a little Morning Air, therefore prithee make
haste to find her, and let her know we are ready
to prosecute our Journey. Alas! resum'd he, I
fear she has deceiv'd you—I give you my Word,
that if she continu'd to ride as she set out, she is,
by this time, some Leagues off. Emanuella
cou'd by these Words think no other than that he
who spoke them was mistaken in the Person she
enquir'd for, and therefore took the pains to describe
her to him: But he presently told her, that
he very well knew who it was she meant; that
they had no other Guests in the House but those
that came with her, and that a young Chevalier
well-mounted had come by Day-break, and took
her away with him. I leave the Reader to judge
what an Astonishment this Intelligence must create
in the Mind of her who heard it: She was for
some time unable to give any Credit to an Information
so highly improbable to be true; but
when she return'd to her Chamber, and found that
not only every thing that belong'd to her was
missing, but also a little Cabinet, which she had
entrusted to her Charge, in which was contain'd
most of the Money she had receiv'd from Don
Jabin; 'tis hard to say, whether Amazement
for so base and cruel an Action, or Grief for the
Misfortunes it must of necessity subject her to,
was most predominant in her Soul—to be betray'd,
robb'd, and forsaken in so barbarous a
manner, by the Person whom of all the World
she had placed the greatest Confidence in—to
be exposed with her dear Infant to all the Miseries
which attend Poverty—to lose at one
Stroke all that she had in the World—No means
left her to make the least Provision against Want 

and Beggary, was something so shocking, so dreadful,
as rendred all her Courage useless. —She
went into the Room where Nurse was dressing her
young Master for his Journey, and the Sight of
him made the Reflection of the Loss she had sustain'd
more terrible to be born: She had not
Words presently to relate what had befallen her:
and when the good Woman, easily perceiving by
her Countenance that something of ill had happen'd,
entreated to know the Matter; she could
get no more from her, for a good while than, O
Nurse, I am undone! —But that, cry'd she, is a
trivial Woe, that lovely Babe, that Charmer at
your Breast, is ruin'd—we must starve, Nurse!
perish for want of Bread—the little All we
had, is lost—no means is left us for Support— 
no Hope but in the Grave. —With these and
the like Exclamations did she make the other sensible,
something very unfortunate had happen'd; 
but what it was, she was far from being able to
guess; 'till her Mistress having a little more recollected
herself, at last acquainted her with the whole
Story. Never did any one bear a greater part in
the Sufferings of another, than did this faithful
Creature in those of Emanuella; the Affability
and Kindness with which she had been treated
by her, had gain'd as great an Interest in her
Affections in the short time she had been with her,
as tho' she had been bred up with her; and then
her Tenderness for the young Victorinus,
was more than equal to that which Mothers ordinarily
feel for their own Children. —She join'd
in all her Lamentations, and vented ten thousand
Curses on the perfidious and ungrateful Cause of
them: But perceiving that this rather encreased
the Distraction of Emanuella, than any way
comforted her, she began to change her Talk,
begging her to be as easy as she could, and to proceed
in her Journey to Alcala; and having enquir'd 

which way Berillia and her Conductor
took, and being inform'd, they went towards that
Town, she endeavour'd to inspire her with a hope
that they might be heard of there. —There was
indeed but little probability in this Conjecture; 
but as this was not a Place to continue in, the distress'd
Lady thought she might as well go there
as to any other Place; and complying with the
Persuasions of her Nurse, they left the Inn, and in
a short time arriv'd at Alcala. 
Nurse's Predictions had so much of Truth
in them, that on Enquiry they found that such
Persons as those they sought had pass'd through
the City, but had staid no longer than to take a
small Refreshment, and were gone on the Road
to Madrid. —To send any body after them Emanuella
knew would be in vain; because it was
impossible they would tarry there, on the account
of Don Jabin: therefore she was obliged to sit
down with the Misfortune without the least Hope
she should ever have any Reparation for it; but
with what racking Reflections, those who will but
give themselves the trouble of thinking what a
Woman in her Circumstances must feel, will be
better able to judge, than all the Descriptions I
could give, would make them. 
What now could this unhappy Lady do? She
was in a Place where she was entirely unacquinted,
tho' that she was so, was the only Consolation
she had; she had no means of providing for herself
and little Family, and when the Charges of
her Journey were defrayed, had scarce any Money
remaining—No Condition sure was ever
so calamitous as her's—Her Spirits had doubtless
sunk beneath the weight of Sorrow, which
oppress'd her, if the Vigour of her Care for her
dear Child had not kept them up. —Something
must be thought on for the procuring for him the
Necessaries of Life, whatever should become of 

herself—and thinking nothing too much to
do for him, she threw off the fine Lady, endeavour'd
to forget whose Daughter she was, and the
Hopes she was bred to, and submitted to the meanest,
and most servile Offices for Bread. —She
took a little Lodging in the cheapest part of the
Town, and leaving her Nurse at home to take
Care of that which was much dearer to her than
all other Consideration, she went every Day to
a Convent in that City; where doing Services for
the Nuns in the manner of an Out or Lay-Sister,
she made a shift to get as much as maintain'd them,
tho' in a manner which none who had known her
before these Misfortunes came upon her, could
have believ'd she could have liv'd to endure. But
what will not Love enable one to go through!
what Difficulties are so great but Inclination can
surmount! She condescended to every thing with
Chearfulness, for the sake of Victorinus; and
while she fed her longing Eyes with gazing on his
Infant-Charms, and clasped the lovely Innocent in
her Arms, she thought herself not wretched; and
passing all the Night in that sweet Employment,
forgot the Hardships of the Day. In spite of the
real Coldness with which she had been treated by
Emilius, and the monstrous Ingratitude and
Baseness she had been made to believe him guilty
of, her Soul still confess'd the Graces of his Person; 
his Image was too deeply impress'd in her
Mind, ever to banish it thence, tho' effac'd and
blotted by the Memory of his Crimes. The little
Victorinus had Features so perfectly resembling
his, that there wanted but Age to make
them appear the same; and this Likeness not a
little added to the Fondness she otherwise had for
him. All the Passion she once had for the Father,
was now transmitted to the Son; which join'd to
the soft Care which all who are Mothers feel, rais'd
her's to the most elevated Pitch that Humanity is
capable of being inspir'd with. 

But, to prosecute the melancholy History of
her Misfortunes; she had languish'd away (for it
could not be call'd living) seven or eight Months
at Alcala in the manner already represented, without
seeing, or being seen by any body she knew; 
but 'tis probable the one might be owing to the
little notice she took of every thing but what concern'd
her Business, and the other to the Station
she was in, so far different from that in which
any one would have imagin'd to have found the
accomplish'd, and once so much ador'd Emanuella. 
But one Day being at the Cloyster-Gate
on her usual Employment, she saw a handsome
young Fryar waiting to be admitted to speak with
the Abbess; happening to stay a little longer than
was customary, she had an opportunity of considering
his Face, and fancying at first sight she
knew him, on looking more heedfully, soon discovered
him to be Don Octavio, one whom
she had formerly many Opportunities of conversing
with at the House of Don Jabin, and whom
she since had heard had fought with Emilius on
the account of Donna Julia. Curiosity made her
enquire of some of the Nuns, who she perceiv'd
knew him, what had been the occasion of his becoming
one of the Religious; and was told by
them, that it was occasion'd by Despair: that Honour
preventing him from attempting any thing
against a Rival who had given him his Life, he forsook
the World as soon as his hopes were at an
end, by the Marriage of Julia with the Count; 
and that the Abbess of that Nunnery being his Aunt,
he came there to pay his Duty as he pass'd thro'
Alcala in his way to some other part of the Country. 
Emanuella had experienc'd too much of
Love and Despair, to be surpriz'd at the Effect
she found those Passions had caus'd in him; and it
was with compassion only she reflected on a Change
so little to be expected from that Gaiety, which he 

was once the most fam'd for of any Chevalier in
Madrid. She was highly satisfy'd however in her
Mind, that her Dress, and the Alteration of her
Circumstances had so much disguis'd her, that a
Person who had been so perfectly acquainted with
her Face, should now have any notion he had seen
it before, and began to live with more security in
her thought, that she might continue undiscover'd,
tho' she should happen to be seen even by Emilius
himself, the Person of all the World from
whom, as she then was, she most desir'd to be
conceal'd. But alas! it was not ordain'd for this
unhappy Woman to have any part of her Wishes
compleated; she but hoped to live and die in this
forlorn Obscurity, and that also was deny'd her:
It was but a few days after she had seen Octavio,
that a Lady, call'd Donna Jacinta del
Florezada, a young Widow of a vast Estate,
who us'd frequently to come and pass some Hours
in conversation with the Nuns, desir'd to speak
with her; she had often seen her at the Convent,
and taking more notice of the Delicacy of her
Hands and Complexion, the Sweetness of her
Voice, and the graceful Manner in which delivered
her Words, than many others who had the
same opportunity of observing her, imagin'd she
had been educated in a fashion which might deserve
a better State of Life than what she at present
liv'd in; and having some young Children, believ'd
she might be a proper Person for a Governess:
She discours'd her on that Head, and putting many
questions to make tryal of her Capacity, found it
so infinitely beyond what even her good Opinion
had suggested, that she immediately made her an
offer of coming into her House, and assur'd her
of Usage more like a Sister than a Servant. 
This Proposal, tho' an extraordinary Favour,
(for Donna Jacinta was not only one of the
greatest, but best Woman in the Place) was not 

altogether so agreeable to Emanuella as the
other expected,—In the first place, she knew
not how to part with that dear Babe, whom as yet
she had never been absent from one Night, and
whom her very Soul was wrapt in. —And
in the next, she was unwilling to go into a Family
where she knew there was always a great Variety
of Company, for fear some one or other might
happen to know her. —The first of these Reasons
she made no scruple of acquainting Donna
Jacinta with, and the other she palliated, by
saying she was of a Disposition too melancholy
to endure the sight of many People; and for that
cause fear'd she might be unfit for the Employment
she would engage her in. —But the obliging
Lady would not be deny'd by any means; she
had taken a fancy to her, and was resolv'd to have
her: she told her she commended the Love and
Care she seem'd to have of her Child, and that she
would be far from endeavouring to alienate an Affection
so praise-worthy, or make her unhappy
by taking her from that which she so dearly priz'd. 
You shall have your Child with you, said she, both
that and a Nurse to look after it shall be as welcome
as your self; and as it grows up, I will undertake
to give him an Education equal to my
own: And as for your other Objections, tho' I
think Company the best relief for Melancholy, I
will not press you to come into it—You shall
see no body but those whom you think fit. — 
Nor will I exact any thing from you, but what
shall be agreeable to your own Inclinations. 
There appeared so uncommon a Good-Nature and
Frankness in this Lady, as well as Advantage in
the Offer she made her, that Emanuella must
have thought herself both her own and Child's Enemy
to have refused it. —She accepted it therefore
with all the Acknowledgements of Gratitude
imaginable, and immediately went home to put herself 

in as good a Capacity as she could, to return to
this kind Patroness for good and all. Her poor
Nurse was over-joy'd when she heard the News; 
and every thing being ready in a few Hours, all
the little Family remov'd from daily Care, Scarcity,
and sometimes Want, to Ease, Plenty, and
Chearfulness: They were receiv'd with a Welcome
far beyond their Expectations; had an Apartment
assign'd for them, as tho' they had been
Guests, not to be continued Inmates of the House: the
Servants were order'd to treat Emanuella, who
had now given herself the Name of Placillia,
with all the respect imaginable, and her Nurse with
the same Kindness, as if it were there own young
Master she attended. Donna Jacinta was so
far from promising more than she intended to
perform, that on the contrary her Words came infinitely
short of her Deeds. Nor was she of that
flashy uncertain Temper which some People are
of, tho' accounted Good-humour'd too, of being
one day extravagantly fond of those they call Friends,
and the next scarce owning they have any such
Acquaintance: She was always the same, always
in one Temper, unless it were, that her Affections
seem'd every day to encrease to her new Companion; 
but that is little to be wonder'd at, since
this unhappy Fair had a stock of Charms in her
Conversation and Behaviour, which were not to
be discover'd all at once: The Amendment in her
manner of living made also so great a one in her
Looks, that she was hardly to be known for the
Person who us'd to be employ'd in Messages, or
whatever other mean Office the Nuns had no more
discernment than to put her to. —She now
began to resume her former Charms, and appear
again herself. Jacinta perceiving her Skill in
Musick, Painting, Philosophy, and all those Accomplishments
which few but those of Quality can
afford, or at least take the pains to have their Children 

instructed in, could not be persuaded but that
she was of Noble Descent, and frequently sollicited
her to give her the History of her Life; but
the other could not be prevail'd upon to relate
more than that her Father was a Gentleman in a
distant part of Spain, and that by marrying against
his Consent to a Person who was now dead, she
had been reduced to many Misfortunes. This was
a Story she had fram'd for all who enquired into
her Affairs; nor cou'd all the kindness of this Lady
oblige her to reveal the Truth: Her Nurse was
also extreamly faithful to the Trust she had reposed
in her, nor ever divulged the least Hint of
those Affairs she knew, which, tho' but a small
part, was yet enough to have made all that her
Mistress had said appear fabulous. 
Thus did she live as happy as a Person can
live, who lives dependent on the Favour of another:
that good Lady took care to confer her Obligations
in such a manner, that they should be as
little as possible uneasy to the Receiver; and the
other was so sensible of her Favours, that she at
length became her's as much thro' Inclination as
Duty. —She had continu'd with her about a
Year without any thing happening of moment,
and she was beginning to think Fortune was grown
weary of persecuting her, and would permit her to
continue in that Asylum of Tranquility which she
now enjoy'd: She had no reason to imagine she
should not live and die with this kind Friend; and
the Experience of her Goodness to herself, gave
her a certainty that the young Victorinus
would find the Effects of it in as full a manner as
if she were to live. —She would often talk
to Donna Jacinta in this manner, who, tho'
she never heard her without renewing the Promises
she had before made her, yet she endeavour'd to
put her off from such kind of Discourses, because
she thought them a kind of Food to that Melancholy 

she seem'd but too much to give way
to. They were sitting together one day, when
a Gentleman and Lady, attended by a great
number of Servants, alighted at the Gate, which
oblig'd Donna Jacinta to go to receive them:
Emanuella continu'd in her Chamber, the other
perceiving how much averse she was to be
seen by any body but the Family, had for a good
while left solliciting her to come into Company; 
but she had not now remain'd long alone, before
she came running into the Room, desiring her she
would oblige her so far as to come down— 
she told her the Persons that came to visit her
were her near Relations, and that the Lady, who
was most passionately fond of her Husband, and
had no Children by him, had happen'd to see the
the little Victorinus at play in the Garden,
and imagin'd him so like her Lord, that she express'd
a prodigious Impatience to see the Mother. 
It would be impossible to represent the Perturbations
of Emanuella's Soul all the time
she heard her speak—she began to think of
something, tho' at present she could not well tell
of what—a sort of distant Guess—a wild
Notion of a Possibility of some wonderful Event— 
a thousand incoherent unconnected Ideas ran in an
instant thro' her Mind, and almost threw her into
a Swoon. Donna Jacinta was extreamly surpriz'd
to find so sudden an Alteration in her Countenance,
and ask'd her if she were not well. — 
No, Madam (answer'd she, soarce able to speak)
and therefore intreat you would excuse my appearing
before this Company. I know not how to
do it (resum'd the other) since they are so very
presling, but will endeavour it at your Request— 
tho' I could wish (added she) that I could prevail
on you: the Lady who is my Cousin Germain,
is marry'd to a Count of the Empire, and it may
be prodigiously in their power to—She had 

opportunity to say no more, the Person she was
speaking to, was now incapable of hearing her,
and fallen at her Feet on the Floor, quite senseless. 
—Amaz'd as she was, she omitted nothing
for her Recovery, and throwing Water on
her Face, soon brought her to herself; but the
Torrent of Tears which gush'd from her Eyes, as
soon as she open'd them—the Sighs, which at
her return of Breath seeming as tho' they would
exhaust it quite, made the good-natur'd Observer
half stupify'd with Grief and Wonder: Nothing
was more apparent, than that she had been brought
into this Condition only by her being press'd to go
into this Company; and not being able to guess
the reason of it, and perceiving she did not go about
to speak it—For Heaven's sake, said she,
what have I said to occasion this Confusion of
your Soul? or what has Count Emilius, or
Donna Julia done, which should render their
Presence so hateful to you? These Words, which
so entirely confirm'd her in those Suggestions which
already had work'd such sad Effects, were very
near throwing her again into those Faintings from
which she had so lately been recover'd—but
mustering up all the Spirit she had left to stand this
Shock, which of all that had befallen her, seem'd
the most terrible, she flung herself at the Feet of
Donna Jacinta, and with trembling Hands
catching hold of her Robe, O pardon me, (said
she, in scarce intelligible Accents) pardon me, most
excellent Lady, that I have abus'd your Goodness
with a feign'd Tale—I am not the Person I
pretended, but a Wretch unworthy of your Favour
—a Wretch, who by one fatal Crime has
drawn down all the stor'd Vengeance of high
Heaven on her—But, as you have hitherto
been so divinely kind—O cast me not off at
once—Expose me not to Horrors worse than
Death—than Hell—O save me from the Sight 

of Emilius, and you shall hereafter be made
sensible of the whole Truth of my unhappy Story. 
Here she stopp'd, and Donna Jacinta was about
to make some Reply, when she was prevented,
by the sudden coming in of Emilius and
his Lady, with the young Victorinus in her
hand: The Surprize they were in, that Jacinta
stay'd so much longer than they expected, their
Impatience to see the Mother of a Child whom
both of them were so much charm'd with, made
them take the Liberty, being told which Room she
was in, of coming up. Emanuella being opposite
to the Door, had the opportunity of seeing
them first; and in the instant Distraction that
View gave her, incapable of any Thought but how
to shun it, a Window by Accident being open,
she flew to it, and crying out, Fate thou hast done
thy worst! was very near throwing herself out of
it, if Donna Jacinta, who, tho' equally surpriz'd,
had her Thoughts more prepar'd for such
an Adventure, had not been very quick in catching
hold of her. Emilius, who at once saw
Emanuella and her Despair, stood for some
Moments like one depriv'd of Motion— 
No Words can reach what 'twas he felt at an
Object so unexpected! so alarming!—the' most
strong Surprize, the most violent Grief, the most
passionate Tenderness at once posses'd him, and
he was as unable to express the Force of either,
as I am to describe it. 
Donna Julia, who had but one Passion to
struggle with, soon overcame that enough to ask
her Cousin Jacinta, what had occasioned the
Confusion she beheld, and her own Consternation? 
But that Lady, who still held the afflicted Emanuella
in her Arms at the other end of the
Room, and was endeavouring to persuade her
to Moderation, had not leisure to make any Reply
to what she said, or to ease her own Wonder, 

by enquiring the Source of this Affair; which tho'
she guess'd at part of, was far from imagining who
Emanuella really was, or the Causes she had
for Despair. Emilius was the only Person who
cou'd unfold this Mystery, and believing, that since
so much had been discover'd, it were best to reveal
the whole, resolv'd to do it, tho' it were so
nice a Point, that it requir'd all the Rhetorick he
was Master of, to handle without giving Offence
to Donna Julia. He was also divided in his
Sentiments, whether it wou'd not more add to the
Disorder of Emanuella to relate the Story
before her Face, or by taking the Company into
another Room, leave her in suspense; but after a
little debate in his Mind, he at length concluded
on the latter as most proper; and drawing nearer
to the Place where Donna Jacinta and Emanuella
were, addressing himself to the former,
Madam, said he, I believe it will be much better
for us to retire, and leave this afflicted Lady to
that Repose our continuing here may hinder her
from enjoying. I will not, Madam! added he,
turning to the other, and bowing very respectfully,
presume to remain in your Sight, nor return to it
'till those Stains the Treachery of the unworthy
Berillia have cast on my Character are remov'd
—then you will find Emilius has
not been so blameable, as at present he appears; 
and will, I hope, admit his Presence without giving
him any Tortures by the sight of yours. As
much averse as Emanuella was to hear him
speak, the Name of Berillia attracted her
Attention—in the midst of her Agonies, in the
midst of that Shock of Nature his sudden coming
had given her, she would have been pleas'd at
finding him not altogether so guilty as she had
believ'd him; and fancying there was a possibility
that unfaithful Creature had deceiv'd her, in the
Representation she had made of him, as well as 

self in other Affairs, would have been contented to
have had him repeat what he knew of her; and
finding there was now an absolute Necessity of every
thing being discover'd, thought the Recital might
as well be made before her Face: she felt something
at her Heart, which gave her an Assurance
she shou'd not long survive so publick an Eclaircissment
of what she had done, and was willing to
submit to the Shame of it, to gratify her Impatience
to acknowledge herself mistaken in condemning
the Man, whom to have found innocent she wou'd,
a long time ago, have parted with Life. If, said
she, my Lord! you have any thing to tell me of
the Falshood of that wicked Wretch, more than
what I am already appriz'd of, I beg it may be
no Secret: Set forth in what terms you please her
Faults, and my Misfortunes; I am inur'd to Miseries
of all kinds, and can endure even this severest
Tryal—Perhaps, continu'd she weeping,
with greater Fortitude than the rest, because it is
the last—the last of Horrors I can live to know. 
She made this Request in such a manner, and accompany'd
it with so many Sighs, and such Distortion
of her Features while she was speaking, that
the Count made a doubt whether it was best for
him to comply with it; and 'tis probable wou'd
have evaded it, had she not over, and over again,
intreated he wou'd relate all he knew, and put a
period to the Amazement which his Wife and
Donna Jacinta were all this time involv'd in; 
'till finding himself press'd past Denial not only
by her but by those two Ladies, who, glad she
had propos'd it, seconded her Desire, was oblig'd
to satisfy their Curiosity; which, after having a
little recollected what he was about to disclose, he
did in these, or the like Words. 
I believe, said he, that for the Satisfaction of a
here, I need repeat no more than what Berillia
herself confess'd, when happening to be taking 

the Air, about a Mile from Madrid, I saw that
unhappy Wretch lying on the Grass, weltring in
her Blood, wounded in three or four Places, and
almost ready to expire: So sad an Object rais'd
all that was compassionate in my Soul; but when I
went nearer, in hopes to afford her some Relief,
Words wou'd but poorly make you sensible what
'?was I felt at knowing her to be Berillia,
whom I thought one of the sincerest of my
Friends. —I began to testify some part of my
Concern, by enquiring by what means she had
become in that Condition, and offering to bind up
her Wounds; but she wou'd not permit me; but
discovering all the marks of the most poinant and
terrible Despair that ever was, told me, all Care
wou'd be in vain, that she was a dead Woman— 
and that if there was a Possibility for her Wounds
to be healed, she wou'd herself make others, which
shou'd be beyond the Power of Art. —And
then, perceiving my Amazement at hearing her
speak in this manner, You (cry'd she) Emilius,
have the least Reason to pity me of all the World— 
you I have wrong'd in the highest manner. — 
O! continu'd she, in an Agon? to which the Rack is
mean, Heaven never can, for the Injustice I have
done you, nor the Ruin I have brought on the
innocent Emanuella—both—both
of you I have betray'd—traduc'd; and tho' she
is the greatest Sufferer, 'tis you appear the only
Criminal. She then, on my Intreaty, and Assurance
of Pardon for whatever she had done, proceeded
to inform me, how cruelly she had accus'd
me to you, and confess'd, that all the Intelligence
she had given me was false concerning your clandestine
Marriage with an inferiour Person, who
since grown weary of, you had sent to Andaluzia,
where he died; of a shameful Intrigue you carry'd
on with another, even at the time that you permitted
my Addresses; and a thousand such like 

monstrous Inventions, which I do not very well
remember; or if I did, shou'd blush to wound your
Ears with. 
Emanuella cou'd not hear the Recital of such
vile Accusations without lifting up her Eyes to Heaven,
in token of Astonishment, that there cou'd
be such Wickedness permitted; but restrained herself
from saying any thing to interrupt him: and
he went on in this manner. 
It may seem like an idle Excuse, continu'd the
Count, for me to say in my Defence, that when
she endeavour'd to bring me to that Opinion her
base Intentions aim'd, she made use of all the Artifice
the Devil ever taught, and bound me from
revealing, either by Words or Letters, a tittle of
what she had said, by Oaths too terrible to be
dispens'd with; so I shall only say, before this Lady
who is now my Wife, I at that time thought
myself too much the Husband of Emanuella to
have made my Addresses to any other, had
not the Stratagems of the false Berillia
impos'd so artfully on my Belief, as to make me
imagine the Engagements between us had been
first dissolv'd by you. —But I will not detain
your Attention, by alledging any thing in vindication
of a Man, whom perhaps, you wish not
shou'd be clear'd; and who has it not now in his
power to repair the Injuries you have suffer'd on
his score. —The dying Berillia, as I
was about to tell you, had Breath enough to confess
all this first part of her Barbarity at large,
but her Strength decreasing, she run but slightly
over that which she afterwards was guilty of to
you, in conspiring with a young Man, whom she
for a long time had held a criminal Conversation
with, to rob you of that Money she had advis'd
you to call out of her Father's hands;—and
how the Villain, as she was travelling with him to
Toledo, as he had made her hope, had taken it 

from her, stabb'd her, and left her in that condition
in which I found her. —The Horrors
which seiz'd on this poor Wretch, at the approach
of Death, would be too dreadful to describe: Never
did I sustain a shock like what the sight of them
occasion'd in me; but, base as she had been, I
had promis'd her Forgiveness; and indeed, the
Penitence she express'd seem'd to deserve it: therefore,
after waiting 'till I found she had no longer
Sense of Pity or Conso'ation, I remounted, and
rode as fast as I cou'd into the Town, with the
melancholy Account of what I had seen and heard
to Don Jabin, who, not forgetting she was his
Child, tho' a disobedient one, sent Servants to
fetch her Body, and bury'd it in a Fashion suitable
to her Quality. 
Here Emilius concluded his Narration,
which, as he expected, put an end to the Wonder
this little Company had been in, before they had
any guess how Placillia and he had been acquainted:
but not only his Wife, but Jacinta
had also heard much of Emanuella, the Misfortunes
which the Avarice of Don Pedro had
subjected her to,—the Favour she had found
from the King, in obliging him to repair part of
the Loss she had sustain'd,—the Engagements
she had with the Count,—their breaking
off,—her going afterward among the
Pourclairs,—her sudden leaving them;— 
and the Discourse that fill'd the Town for what reason
she had been oblig'd to do so. —All
this was no Secret to either of them, and from the
first Discovery that Placillia was Emanuella,
they ceas'd to be surpriz'd at the Effects of
such a meeting: but both of them, as well as Emanuella
herself, expected he would have taken
some notice, in his Discourse, of the little Victorinus,
who, doubtless, had not been left
unmention'd by Berillia; and whom, since 

the clearing of his Mother's Innocence, he cou'd
make no doubt of being his own Child:— 
but that was a Subject he fear'd wou'd be too
shocking to the well-known Niceness of Emanuella's
Modesty. —Besides, he knew not how
his Wife might take a Repetition of what, by many
Circumstances, she cou'd not but be sensible of without
—But that Lady suspecting the Reasons of his Silence
on that head, and willing to shew how much
her Soul disdain'd that mean Passion Wives are too
liable to fall into; taking Emanuella by the
Hand, and pressing it with a most obliging Tenderness; 
Tho', Madam (said she) the Count has
Charms, which created in me a Wish to become
his Wife, long before I had the least Hope of being
so; I beg you will believe me, when I protest
by all that's sacred, that had I been appriz'd of
the Right you had in him, I would have chose to
fall a Martyr to Despair, rather than by gratifying
my Desires, have been guilty of so much Injustice; 
nor can I ever yield to be Partaker more of Joys
to which you have a superior Claim, unless you
vouchsafe to give a Sanction which the Priest had
not the power to do: Emilius first was yours,— 
is still yours, by all those Ties which ought to
bind an honest Mind; and, if you can forgive the
Crime he has been but betray'd to act, I here resign
him, and with him, the Title I have innocently
so long usurp'd. —Emanuella,
who had listned with Surprize to this uncommon
Generosity, wou'd suffer her to proceed no farther,
but interrupting her—How glad am I
(said she) to find before I die, one Woman, whose
Excellence of Nature will preserve my Sex from
those Imputations the monstrous Wickedness
of Berillia wou'd else draw on it:— 
But, do not think, most incomparable Julia,
that I have a Soul so little capable of Gratitude, as
to abuse such Goodness;—Emilius is only 

yours,; whatever Engagements had pass'd between
us, I myself dissolv'd. —When, by the
Loss of my Fortune I thought my self unworthy
of his Bed, I relinquish'd all the Right his Vows
had given me to him; and his enfranchis'd Heart
was free for you, or any Lady whose Deserts
might claim the Prize. —I have nothing to
accuse him of, and am too much his Friend, not
to rejoice that his good Stars directed him, where
Beauty join'd with such consummate Virtue cannot
fail to give him lasting Happiness. Nothing I
cou'd say wou'd be sufficiently Picturest, to paint
the various Agitations which perplex'd the Soul of
Emilius all the time they were speaking; but
the Matter was too delicate for him, to offer at an
Interposition; and not being able to say any thing
but what might possibly cause Distaste either in the
one or the other, he chose to remain silent, and
leave the noble-minded Ladies to decide the generous
Contest as they pleas'd: When the admirable
Julia thus prosecuted the Design, which had
induc'd her to speak in the manner she had done
to Emanuella. Since, Madam, (said she)
either to the Sweetness of your Disposition, which
will not suffer you to render a Woman, who, you
think, has not sufficient Fortitude to sustain it,
miserable by the Loss of all she loves, or to the
little Inclination you have to pardon him, who, after
the admirable Emanuella, cou'd look on
any other with a Lover's Eyes: To which soever
of these Reasons I am indebted for the continuance
of the Name I wear, you must permit me
to remind you, there is another Tye, of which you
have not the power to disengage Emilius:— 
This lovely Infant (continu'd she, taking Victorinus
in her Arms) whom at first sight attracted my Love,
must ever be acknowledg'd as the just Heir of all
his Father is possess'd of;—and, give me leave
also, to regard him with a Mother's Tenderness; 

and how many Children soever Heaven shall be
pleas'd to bless me with, make him an equal Sharer
with them of all the little Fortune I can call
my own. —Nay (added she, after a little Pause,
and perceiving, by her Looks, the Confusion of Emanuella's
Soul at these Words) as a Testimony
that you are not displeas'd at the Interest I pretend
to take in this little Charmer, you must consent to
live with me as a Sister,—as a Friend. — 
Here Donna Jacinta (pitying from her Soul
the Emotions Emanuella must feel at such Obligements
from her Rival) thought it was her Place
to speak; and interrupting her, No, Cousin, (said
she) I must put a bar to this last Request;— 
I had a Friendship for Emanuella, before I
knew who she was, and cannot consent to part
with her when I find her so much more worthy
my Esteem:—She must continue with me
'till Death inforces a Separation—She was
about to say something more, when Emanuella,
over-press'd with Shame, with Gratitude,
with Tenderness, and perhaps a mixture of another
Passion more difficult to be supported than all
the rest, had no longer Strength to struggle with
the differing Agitations, and sunk fainting in her
Chair: It would be hard to say, whether the Care
of bringing her to herself, appear'd most zealous
in the Endeavours of Donna Julia, Donna Jacinta,
or Emilius; the latter of whom, as
soon as she was in a Condition of hearing them, said
a thousand tender and obliging things to her; nor
did the generous Partner of his Bed conceive the least
Displeasure at it, but, on the contrary thought he
never cou'd express a Sense enough of what that
unhappy Lady had suffer'd for him, and wou'd have
rejoyc'd that Fate had put it in her power to have
afforded her any Consolation: but alas! her Misfortunes
were now arriv'd at their utmost height,
and soon must know a Period with her Life. — 

Resentment was all which for a long time had kept
the Lamp of Life awake, and that being now
extinguish'd in a Flood of softer Passions, the other
must of necessity expire. —They soon
found she was too much disorder'd for Conversation,
and therefore thought it convenient she
should be put into a Bed, where perceiving she
grew worse, a Physician was sent for to attend; 
but from the Moment he saw her, he began to
doubt any Success of his Prescriptions: In short,
she died in three days, of no other Distemper than
a broken Heart; equally lamented by Donna Julia
as by Emilius and Jacinta: Nor did
they, after her Death, take less Care than they
had promis'd of young Victorinus; each
seem'd to out-vye the other in their Fondness of
him: He was bred in all the Accomplishments
which can adorn a Youth of Quality; and after
the Decease of Emilius and his generous Lady,
who never had any Children herself, was left in
possession of the Fortunes of them both, with a
considerable Addition from the Friendship of Jacinta:
which he makes use of with a Nobleness
of Soul, proportionable to the Hopes of those
who gave him the Means of expressing it; and is
at this day the greatest Ornament of the Kingdom
which claims his Birth.
