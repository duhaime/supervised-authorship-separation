Contains, among other things, an account of a very extraordinary, and no less severe trial of female fortitude and moderation. 
According to all the observations which reason and a long experience has enabled me to make, happiness is a thing which ought to be totally erased out of the vocabulary of sublunary enjoyments;—the human heart is liable to so many passions, and the events of fortune so uncertain and precarious, that life is little more than a continued series of anxieties and suspence:—what we pursue as the ultimate of our desires, the summum bonum of all our wishes, 
fleets before us, dances in the wind, seems at sometimes ready to meet our grasp, at others soaring quite out of reach; or, when attain'd, deceives our expectations, baffles our high-raised hopes, and shews the fancy'd heaven a mere vapour. 
Nor is this to be wondered at, or indeed much to be pitied in those who place their happiness in the gratification of their passions, which all of them in general tend to the acquisition of what is far from being a real good;—but there are some, though I fear an inconsiderable number, who, compos'd of more equal elements, wisely avoid the restless aims, the giddy vain pursuits with which they see so many of their fellow creatures so intoxicated and perplex'd;—would fain sit down contented with their lot, whatever it happens to be, and observing this maxim of the poet, 
Not toss and turn about their feverish will,
But know their ease must come by lying still.
Yet not even these can find an asylum from cares;—though the soul, like a hermit in his cell, sits quiet in the bosom, 
unruffled by any tempest of its own, it suffers from the rude blasts of others faults;—envy and detraction are sure to taint it with their envenom'd breath;—treachery, deceit and all kinds of injustice alarm it with the most dreadful apprehensions of impending danger, and shew the necessity of keeping a continual guard against their pernicious enterprises;—but above all, the ingratitude of friends is the most terrible to sustain;—that anguish which proceeds from the detected falshood of a person on whom we depend is almost insupportable; nor can reason or philosophy be always sufficient to defend us from it,—as I remember to have somewhere read, 
Fate ne'er strikes deep but when unkindness joins.
This is certainly a very melancholy circumstance; and the situation of the injured person's mind cannot but be very uneasy;—after having placed an entire confidence in any one whom we believe to be our friend,—after having intrusted him with the dearest secrets of our lives, and rely'd upon him for all the services and good offices in his power,—then, I say, to find him base, ungenerous and deceitful, is as poignant an 
affliction as any to which language can give a name. 
I know not whether to be eternally deprived of a real and experienced friend by the stroke of death, be not a less shock than it is to lose one, whom we have always believed as such, by his own infidelity. —Under the former of these misfortunes we have the liberty to indulge many consolitory reflections;—first, that the great law of nature must be obey'd, and that there was an indispensible necessity for us to be one day separated;—secondly, in the hope that the person we lament is a gainer by this change, and much more happy than mortal life could make him;—and thirdly, though it may seem perhaps a wild idea, in supposing a possibility that he may be still a witness of our actions, be pleased at our remembrance of him; and, at the hour of our dissolution, even be appointed our conducter to the celestial mansions:—but under the latter, that of being betrayed by a false friend, we can have no such agreeable images before our eyes;—on the contrary,—grief and despair for ill-requited tenderness and sincerity, accompanied with remorse and shame for having made so unworthy a choice, must 
be the only subjects of our distracted meditations. 
Thus impossible is it, for minds the most serene by nature, to remain always wholly free from inquietudes of one shape or other;—Jenny, the heroine of this history, had a temper not easily discomposed, and well deserved that character which our English Sappho gave of a lady for whom she had a particular veneration. 
Chearful as birds that welcome in the spring,
No ill suspecting, nor no danger dreading;
In conscious innocence secure and bless'd,
She liv'd belov'd of all, and loving all.
And yet she met with something, which, if it had not all the effect it would have produced in most others of her sex, was at least sufficient to turn that so lately harmonious frame of mind into a kind of chaos and inextricable confusion. 
Those arrows of vexation which the base contrivances of Bellpine had levell'd 
against her peace, had hitherto proved unsuccessful;—they had either miss'd their aim, or slightly glanc'd upon her without doing any real mischief; but she now received a random shot, and from a hand which least design'd to hurt her, that pierced her tender bosom to the quick, and left a wound behind which requir'd a long length of time to heal. 
Since the adventure of Celandine the ladies had lived for some days in an uninterrupted scene of gaity;—every day,—almost every hour, brought with it some new pleasure or amusement;—to heighten Jenny's satisfaction she had receiv'd a letter from Jemmy, acquainting her that his business was now near being concluded, and that he should very shortly be with her at Bath;—he wrote to her on this account in terms so positive, that she doubted not but his next would inform her of the day in which he was to set out from London. 
In that expectation she sent him an answer full of tenderness, expressing the sincere pleasure she took in the hopes he gave her of seeing him so soon, and desiring he would not let slip the first opportunity that presented itself of fulfilling his promise; though, in effect, 
she thought this injunction very needless; for she had that perfect confidence in him as to assure herself he would not lose a single moment that might bring him nearer to her. 
But behold the swift vicissitude of human affairs; how in one instant are the face of things changed to the reverse of what they were? The ladies had been at a Ball, which detain'd them till very late;—on their coming home, Jenny remembering it was the day that the post came in, she ask'd if no letter had been brought for her; and being told there was, and that it lay upon her toylet, she wish'd the ladies a good night and ran hastily to her chamber in order to peruse the letter, which she doubted not but came from her dear Jemmy, with the certainty of his immediate approach. 
She was not, indeed, deceived in the former part of her conjecture;—she saw it was Jemmy's hand, and directed as usual 
To miss Jessamy at Bath.
But what was her amazement,—her consternation,—when breaking the seal and unfolding the paper with all the impatience 
of the most warm affection, she found the contents as follows: 

“Dear Angel,
When I acquainted you with that curst engagement which an unavoidable necessity has laid me under, I little thought you would have resented it in the manner you now seem to do; especially when I assured you, with the utmost sincerity, that I would break from it as soon as I could find a pretence to do it with decency;—you might, methinks, have known me better than to suspect I would omit any thing in my power to hasten the happy minute of flying to your arms with a heart unencumber'd with any cares but those of pleasing you. 
“If you return the passion I have for you with half that gratitude you have so inchantingly avow'd, you will repent,—you must by this time repent the pains you cannot but be sensible your cruel billet has inflicted on me. 
“I flatter myself with being able to see you in a few days at our usual place of meeting; when, if you are as just 
as you are fair, you will be more kind to him who is, 
“With an unextinguishable flame,
My dear charmer,
Your most devoted,
And faithful servant,
J. Jessamy.” 
“P.S. If I have any friends among the intellectual world, I shall petition them to haunt your nightly dreams with the shadow of me, till propitious fortune throws the substance at your feet.” 

What now was the condition of Jenny?—she re-examined the seal and the handwriting;—she knew both too well to flatter herself with a possibility of their being counterfeited; nor was it in her power to conceive that the engagement mention'd in the letter could be any other than that between herself and Jemmy. —Where are the words can furnish a description? where is the heart, not under the same circumstances, that can be truly sensible of what she felt? —Grief and indignation in these first moments 
were absorbed in wild astonishment, convulsions seiz'd her breast,—her brain grew giddy,—her eyes dazzled, while attempting to look over again some passages in this fatal letter, and her whole frame being agitated with emotions too violent for nature to sustain, she fell back in the chair where she was sitting, and every function ceas'd its operation. 
Her maid, who was waiting in her chamber, perceiving this, flew to her assistance, threw some lavender-water on her face, and at the same time scream'd out for help;—Lady Speck and miss Wingman, being that instant coming up stairs to their apartment, heard the cries, and ran into the room;—they found their fair friend without any signs of breath and motionless;—they took hold of her hands and felt them bedew'd all over, as was her lovely face, with a cold dead damp, like that of the last agonies of departing life. 
Surprised and frighted beyond measure, they cut the laceings of her stays,—raised her head,—bent her gently forwards,—apply'd hartshorn to her nostrils and temples, and every other remedy they could think of, till at length, either through their endeavours or the force 
of nature labouring for itself, she recover'd by degrees, open'd her eyes, and uttered some words, which though inarticulate rejoiced their hearts. 
Reason and recollection, however, were not as yet return'd, and lady Speck finding her disorder still continued very violent, thought proper, late as it then was, to send for a physician, and in the mean time both she and her sister, as well as their women servants, who were call'd in, assisted in putting her into bed, where she was no sooner laid than she grew better; not only her voice but her senses also were enough restor'd to thank the ladies for the trouble they had taken; and to tell them, in order to conceal the real cause, that she believed her disorder was occasion'd by her having danced too much that night. 
The physician being come, she notwithstanding suffer'd him to feel her pulse, and promised to follow his prescription, which was only a composing draught for that night; though he departed not without giving some items that his advice would be necessary next day. 
The ladies, after having seen her take the dose prepared for her, retir'd and 
left her to the care of her own maid and lady Speck's woman, who both sat by her bed-side the whole remainder of the night.
