the 32d, 33d, and 34th Days of my Imprisonment. 

Nothing offers these Days but Squabblings
between Mrs. Jewkes and me. She grows
worse and worse to me. I vexed her yesterday, because
she talked nastily, and told her she talk'd more
like a vile London Prostitute, than a Gentleman's
Housekeeper; and she cannot use me bad enough
for it. Bless me! she curses and storms at me like a
Trooper, and can hardly keep her Hands off me. 
You may believe she must talk sadly to make me say
such harsh Words: Indeed it cannot be repeated; 
and she is a Disgrace to her Sex. And then she ridicules
me, and laughs at my Notions of Honesty; 
and tells me, impudent Creature that she is! what a
fine Bedfellow I shall make for my Master, and such-like,
with such whimsical Notions about me! — 
Do you think this is to borne? And yet she talks
worse than this, if possible! —Quite filthily! O what
vile Hands am I put into!
