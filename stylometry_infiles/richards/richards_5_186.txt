From the Earl of G. To Lady G. 


Tuesday, Aug. 1.
My dear Daughter,
Let me be excused for asking you a question by
pen and ink: When do you think of returning
from Northamptonshire? Lady Gertrude and I are
out of all patience with you; not with Lord G. We
know, that where-ever you are, there will he wish to
be: His treasure and his heart must be together. But
to me, who always loved my son; to Lady Gertrude,
who always loved her nephew; and who equally rejoiced
in the happy event that gave me a daughter,
and her a niece; what can you say in excuse for robing
us of both? It is true, Miss Byron is a Lady
that ought to be half the world to you: But must the
other half have no manner of regard paid to it? I
have enquired of Lord and Lady L. but they say you
are so far from setting your time for return, that you
are pressing them to go down to you. What can my
daughter mean by this? Have you taken a house in
Northamptonshire? Have you forgot that you have
taken one in Grosvenor Square? Every-thing is done
there, that you had ordered to be done; and all are
at a stand for further directions. Let me tell you,
Lady G. that my sister and I love you both too well
to bear to be thus slighted. Love us but half as well,
and you will tell us the day of your return. You
don't consider that we are both in years; and that, in
all probability, you may often rejoice in the company
you are with, when you cannot have ours. Excuse
this serious conclusion. I am serious upon the subject
â€”And why? Because I love you with a tenderness
truly paternal. Pray make mine and my sister's
compliments acceptable to the loveliest woman in
England, and to every one whom she loves, who 

are now in Northamptonshire. I am, my dearest
daughter, 
Your ever-affectionate
G.
