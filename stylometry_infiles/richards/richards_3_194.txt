From Mrs. B. to Lady Davers. 


My dear Lady Davers,
I Understand from Miss Darnford, that before she
went down from us, her Papa had encourag'd
a Proposal made by Sir W. G. whom you saw, when
your Ladyship was a kind Visitor in Bedfordshire. We
all agreed, if your Ladyship remembers, that he was
a polite and sensible Gentleman, and I find it is
countenanc'd on all Hands. 
Poor Mrs. Jewkes, Madam, as Miss informs me,
has paid her last Debt. I hope, thro' Mercy,
she is happy! Poor, poor Woman! –––But why say
I so! –––Since in that Case, she will be richer than
an earthly Monarch! At least till he is levell'd with
her in Death! 
Your Ladyship was once mentioning a Sister of
Mrs. Worden's, whom you could be glad to recommend
to some worthy Family. —Shall I beg of
you, Madam, to oblige Mr. B.'s in this Particular? 
I am sure she must have Merit, if your Ladyship
thinks well of her; and your Commands in this, as
well as in every other Particular, shall have their
due Weight with 
Your Ladyship's
Obliged Sister, and humble Servant,
P. B. 
Just now, dear Madam, Mr. B. tells me, I shall
have Miss Goodwin brought me hither Tomorrow!
