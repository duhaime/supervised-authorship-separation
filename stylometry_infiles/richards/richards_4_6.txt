Dear Father,
I must needs say, your Letter has fill'd me
with Trouble: For it has made my Heart,
which was overflowing with Gratitude for my
Master's Goodness, suspicious and fearful; and
yet, I hope I shall never find him to act unworthy
of his Character; for what could he get by
ruining such a poor young Creature as me? But
that which gives me most Trouble is, that you
seem to mistrust the Honesty of your Child. 
No, my dear Father and Mother, be assur'd,
that, by God's Grace, I never will do any thing
that shall bring your grey Hairs with Sorrow
to the Grave. I will die a thousand Deaths,
rather than be dishonest any way. Of that be
assur'd, and set your Hearts at Rest; for altho'
I have liv'd above myself for some Time past,
yet I can be content with Rags and Poverty,
and Bread and Water, and will embrace them,
rather than forfeit my good Name, let who will
be the Tempter. And of this, pray rest satisfy'd,
and think better of 
Your dutiful Daughter, till Death. 
My Master continues to be very affable to me. 
As yet I see no Cause to fear any thing. 
Mrs. Jervis the House-keeper too is very
civil to me, and I have the Love of every
body. Sure they can't all have Designs 

against me because they are civil! I hope
I shall always behave so as to be respected
by every one; and that nobody would do
me more Hurt, than I am sure I would do
them. Our John so often goes your Way,
that I will always get him to call, that you
may hear from me, either by Writing, (for
it keeps my Hand in) or by Word of
Mouth.
