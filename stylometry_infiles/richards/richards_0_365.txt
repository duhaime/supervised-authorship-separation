Miss Cl. Harlowe, To Miss Arab. Harlowe. 

Friday, July 21. 
If, my dearest Sister, I did not think the state of my
health very precarious, and that it was my duty to
take this step, I should hardly have dared to approach
you, altho' but with my pen, after having found your
censures so dreadfully justified as they have been. 
I have not the courage to write to my father himself; 
nor yet to my mother. And it is with trembling, that I
address myself to you, to beg of you to intercede for me; 
that my father will have the goodness to revoke that heaviest
part of the very heavy curse he laid upon me, which
relates to HEREAFTER; For, as to the HERE, I
have, indeed, met with my punishment from the very wretch
in whom I was supposed to place my confidence. 
As I hope not for restoration to favour, I may be allowed
to be very earnest on this head: Yet will I not use
any arguments in support of my request, because I am sure
my father cannot wish to have his poor child miserable
for ever! 
I have the most grateful sense of my mother's goodness
in sending me up my cloaths. I would have acknowleged
the favour the moment I received them, with the most
thankful duty, but that I feared any line from me would
be unacceptable. 
I would not give fresh offence: So will decline all other
commendations of duty and love; appealing to my heart 

for both, where both are flaming with an ardour that nothing
but death can extinguish: Therefore only subscribe
myself, without so much as a name, 
My dear and happy Sister,
Your afflicted Servant. 
A letter directed for me, at Mr. Smith's, a glover, in
King-street, Covent-garden, will come to hand.
