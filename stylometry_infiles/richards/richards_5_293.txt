Sir Charles Grandison, To Lady Grandison. 


Saturday, Febr. 17. 
All day yesterday I was in pain that I heard not
from Clementina. But I made myself as easy as
I could in visiting my sisters, and their Lords, and my
aunt Grandison. What blessings do they all pour
forth on my Harriet! What compassion do they express
for the dear fugitive! How do they long to see
her! 
Yesterday I received a Letter from her. 
The copy of that to which hers is an answer; of
hers; and of my reply; and her return to that; I inclose. 
You will read them to our friends in English. 
You will find by the last of the four, that I am to
be admitted to her presence. I would not miss a post,
or I should have delayed, till the interview be over, the
sending this to my Harriet. Hope the best, my dearest
Love. The purity of your heart, and of Clementina's,
and the integrity of my own, if I know my
heart, bid us humbly hope for a happy dissipation of
the present cloud, which, hanging over the heads of a
family I revere, engages our compassion, and mingles
a sigh with our joys. 
Adieu, my best, my dearest Love. Answer for
me to all my friends. 
Charles Grandison.
