Just now he has sent me up, by Mrs.
Jewkes, the following Proposals. So here
are the honourable Intentions all at once laid
open. They are, my dear Parents, to make
me a vile kept Mistress: Which, I hope, I shall
always detest the Thoughts of. But you'll see
how they are accommodated to what I should
have most desir'd, could I have honestly promoted
it, your Welfare and Happiness. I have 

answer'd them, as I'm sure you'll approve; and
I am prepar'd for the worst: For tho' I fear
there will be nothing omitted to ruin me, and
tho' my poor Strength will not be able to defend
me, yet I will be innocent of Crime in my Intention,
and in the Sight of God; and to Him
leave the avenging of all my Wrongs, in his
own good Time and Manner. I shall write to
you my Answer against his Articles; and hope
the best, tho' I fear the worst. But if I should
come home to you ruin'd and undone, and
may not be able to look you in the Face; yet
pity and inspirit the poor Pamela, to make her
little Remnant of Life easy; for long I shall not
survive my Disgrace. And you may be assured
it shall not be my Fault, if it be my Misfortune. 


“To Mrs Pamela Andrews.
This is my ANSWER.
“The following ARTICLES are
proposed to your
serious Consideration; 
and let me
have an Answer,
in Writing, to
them; that I may
take my Resolutions
accordingly.
Only remember,
that I will not
be trifled with;
Forgive, good Sir, the
Spirit your poor Servant
is about to shew
in her Answer to
your Articles.
Not to be warm, and
in earnest, on such
an Occasion as the
present, would shew
a Degree of Guilt,
that, I hope, my Soul
abhors. I will not
trifle with you, nor

and what you give
for Answer, will
absolutely decide
your Fate, without
Expostulation
or further Trouble:
act like a Person
doubtful of her own
Mind; for it wants
not one Moment's
Consideration with
me; and I therefore
return the Answer
following, let what
will be the Consequence:
“I. If you can convince
me, that
the hated Parson has
had no Encouragement
from you in
his Addresses; and
that you have no Inclination
for him, in
Preference to me; 
then I will offer the
following Proposals
to you, which I
will punctually make
good.
I. As to the first Article,
Sir, it may
behove me (that I may
not deserve, in your
Opinion, the opprobrious
Terms of forward,
and artful, and
such-like) to declare solemnly,
that Mr. Williams
never had the
least Encouragement
from me, as to what
you hint; and I believe
his principal Motive
was the apprehended
Duty of his Function,
quite contrary to his
apparent Interest, to assist
a Person he thought
in Distress. You may,
Sir, the rather believe
me, when I declare,

that I know not the
Man breathing I would
wish to marry; and that
the only one I could
honour more than another,
is the Gentleman,
who, of all others,
seeks my everlasting
Dishonour. 
“II. I will directly
make you a Present
of 500 Guineas, for
your own Use, which
you may dispose of
to any Purpose you
please: And will give
it absolutely into the
Hands of any Person
you shall appoint to
receiveit; and expect
no Favour in Return,
till you are satisfy'd
in the Possession of
it.
II. As to your second
Proposal, let the
Consequence be what it
will, I reject it with all
my Soul. Money, Sir,
is not my chief Good:
May God Almighty
desert me, whenever it
is; and whenever, for
the sake of that, I can
give up my Title to that
blessed Hope which will
stand me in stead, at a
Time when Millions of
Gold will not purchase
one happy Moment of
Reflection on a past
mis-spent Life!
“III. I will likewise
directly make
over to you a Purchase
I lately made
III. Your third
Proposal, Sir, I reject,
for the same Reason; 
and am sorry you could

per Annum, clear of
all Deductions. This
shall be made over
to you in full Property
for your Life,
and for the Lives of
any Children, to Perpetuity,
that you
may happen to have:
And your Father
shall be immediately
put into Possession
of it in Trust for
these Purposes. And
the Management of
it will yield a comfortable
Subsistence
to him and your Mother,
for Life; and
I will make up any
Deficiencies, if such
should happen, to
that clear Sum, and
allow him 50 l. per
Annum besides, for
his Life, and that of
your Mother, for
his Care and Management
of this
your Estate.
think my poor honest
Parents would enter
into their Part of it,
and be concern'd for
the Management of an
Estate, which would be
owing to the Prostitution
of their poor
Daughter. Forgive,
Sir, my Warmth on
this Occasion; but you
know not the poor
Man, and the poor
Woman, my ever dear
Father and Mother, if
you think, that they
would not much rather
chuse to starve in a
Ditch, or rot in a noisome
Dungeon, than
accept of the Fortune
of a Monarch, upon
such wicked Terms. I
dare not say all that my
full Mind suggests to me
on this grievous Occasion.
—But indeed,
Sir, you know them
not; nor shall the Terrors
of Death, in its
most frightful Forms, I
hope, thro' God's assisting
Grace, ever make

me act unworthy of
such poor honest Parents!
“IV. I will, moreover,
extend my Favour
to any other of
your Relations, that
you may think worthy
of it, or that are
valued by you.
IV. Your Fourth
Proposal, I take upon
me, Sir, to answer as
the Third. If I have
any Friends that want
the Favour of the Great,
may they ever want it,
if they are capable of
desiring it on unworthy
Terms!
“V. I will, besides,
order Patterns to be
sent you for chusing
Four complete Suits
of rich Cloaths, that
you may appear with
Reputation, as if you
were my Wife.
And I will give you
the Two Diamond
Rings, and Two
Pair of Ear-rings,
and Diamond Necklace,
that were
bought to present to
Miss Tomlins, if the
Match that was proposed
between her
V. Fine Cloaths,
Sir, become not me; 
nor have I any Ambition
to wear them. I
have greater Pride in
my Poverty and Meanness,
than I should have
in Dress and Finery.
Believe me, Sir, I think
such things less become
the humble-born Pamela,
than the Rags
your good Mother rais'd
me from. Your Rings,
Sir, your Necklace, and
your Ear-rings, will better
befit Ladies of Degree,
than me: And to

and me had been
brought to Effect:
And I will confer
upon you still other
Gratuities, as I shall
find myself obliged,
by your good Behaviour
and Affection.
lose the best Jewel, my
Virtue, would be poorly
recompens'd by those
you propose to give
me. What should I
think, when I looked
upon my Finger, or
saw, in the Glass, those
Diamonds on my Neck,
and in my Ears, but
that they were the
Price of my Honesty; 
and that I wore those
Jewels outwardly, because
I had none inwardly?
“VI. Now, Pamela,
will you see
by this, what a Value
I set upon the
Free-will of a Person
already in my Power; 
and who, if these
Proposals are not accepted,
shall find,
that I have not taken
all these Pains, and
risqued my Reputation,
as I have done,
without resolving to
gratify my Passion
for you, at all Adventures;
VI. I know, Sir,
by woful Experience,
that I am in your
Power: I know all the
Resistance I can make
will be poor and weak,
and perhaps stand me
in little stead: I dread
your Will to ruin me is
as great as your Power:
Yet, Sir, will I dare to
tell you, that I will make
no Free-will Offering
of my Virtue. All that
I can do, poor as it is,
I will do, to convince

and if you
refuse, without making
any Terms at all.
you, that your Offers
shall have no Part in my
Choice; and if I cannot
escape the Violence
of Man, I hope, by
God's Grace, I shall
have nothing to reproach
myself, for not
doing all in my Power
to avoid my Disgrace; 
and then I can safely
appeal to the great God,
my only Refuge and
Protector, with this
Consolation, That my
Will bore no Part in
the Violation.
“VII. You shall be
Mistress of my Person
and Fortune, as
much as if the foolish
Ceremony had
passed. All my Servants
shall be yours; 
and you shall chuse
any Two Persons to
attend yourself, either
Male or Female,
without any Controul
of mine; and
if your Conduct be
VII. I have not
once dared to look so
high, as to such a Proposal
as your Seventh
Article contains. Hence
have proceeded all my
little, abortive Artifices
to escape from the Confinement
you have put
me in; altho' you promis'd
to be honourable
to me. Your Honour,
well I knew, would
not let you stoop to so

such, that I have
Reason to be satisfy'd
with it, I know
not (tho' I will not
engage for this) but I
may, after a Twelve-month's
Cohabitation,
marry you; for
if my Love increases
for you, as it has done
for many Months
past, it will be impossible
for me to deny
you any thing.
mean and so unworthy
a Slave, as the poor
Pamela: All I desire
is, to be permitted to
return to my native
Meanness, unviolated.
What have I done, Sir,
to deserve it should be
otherwise? For the obtaining
of this, tho' I
would not have marry'd
your Chaplain, yet
would I have run away
with your meanest Servant,
if I had thought I
could have got safe to
my beloved Poverty. I
heard you once say,
Sir, That a certain great
Commander, who
could live upon Lentils,
might well refuse
the Bribes of the greatest
Monarch: And, I
hope, as I can contentedly
live at the meanest
Rate, and think not
myself above the lowest
Condition, that I am
also above making an
Exchange of my Honesty
for all the Riches
of the Indies. When
“And now, Pamela,
consider well,
it is in your Power
to oblige me on
such Terms, as
will make yourself,
and all your
Friends, happy:
But this will be
over this very Day,
irrevocably over; 
and you shall find
all you would be
thought to fear,
without the least
Benefit arising
from it to your
self.

“And I beg you
will well weigh
the Matter, and
comply with my
Proposals; and I
will instantly set
about securing to
you the full Effect
of them: And let
me, if you value
yourself, experience
a grateful Return
on this Occasion; 
and I'll forgive
all that's past.” 
I come to be proud and
vain of gaudy Apparel,
and outside Finery; 
then (which, I hope,
will never be) may I
rest my principal Good
in such vain Trinkets,
and despise for them
the more solid Ornaments
of a good Fame,
and a Chastity inviolate!
Give me leave to
say, Sir, in Answer to
what you hint, That
you may, in a Twelve-

month's Time, marry me, on the Continuance
of my good Behaviour; that this weighs less with
me, if possible, than any thing else you have said. 
For, in the first Place, there is an End of all
Merit, and all good Behaviour, on my Side, if
I have now any, the Moment I consent to your
Proposals. And I should be so far from expecting
such an Honour, that I will pronounce, that
I should be most unworthy of it. What, Sir,
would the World say, were you to marry your
Harlot? —That a Gentleman of your Rank in
Life, should stoop, not only to the base-born
Pamela, but to a base-born Prostitute? —Little,
Sir, as I know of the World, I am not to be
caught with a Bait so poorly cover'd as this! 
Yet, after all, dreadful is the Thought,
that I, a poor, weak, friendless, unhappy 

Creature, am too fully in your Power! But
permit me, Sir, to pray, as I now write, on
my bended Knees, That before you resolve
upon my Ruin, you will weigh well the Matter. 
Hitherto, Sir, tho' you have taken large
Strides to this crying Sin, yet are you on this
Side the Commission of it. —When once it
is done, nothing can recal it! And where will
be your Triumph? —What Glory will the
Spoils of such a weak Enemy yield you? Let
me but enjoy my Poverty with Honesty, is all
my Prayer; and I will bless you, and pray for
you, every Moment of my Life! Think, O
think! before it is yet too late! what Stings,
what Remorse will attend your dying Hour,
when you come to reflect, that you have ruin'd,
perhaps, Soul and Body, a wretched Creature,
whose only Pride was her Virtue! And how
pleas'd you will be, on the contrary, if in that
tremendous Moment you shall be able to acquit
yourself of this foul Crime, and to plead in
your own Behalf, that you suffer'd the earnest
Supplications of an unhappy Wretch to prevail
with you to be innocent yourself, and let her
remain so! —May God Almighty, whose
Mercy so lately sav'd you from the Peril of perishing
in deep Waters, (on which, I hope, you
will give me Cause to congratulate you!) touch
your Heart in my Favour, and save you from
this Sin, and me from this Ruin! —And to
Him do I commit my Cause; and to Him will
I give the Glory, and Night and Day pray for 

you, if I may be permitted to escape this great
Evil! —From 
Your poor, oppressed,
broken-spirited Servant. 

I took a Copy of this for your Perusal, my
dear Parents, if I shall ever be so happy to see
you again (for I hope my Conduct will be approv'd
of by you); and at Night, when Sir
Simon was gone, he sent for me down. Well,
said he, have you consider'd my Proposals? Yes,
Sir, said I, I have. And there is my Answer:
But pray let me not see you read it. Is it your
Bashfulness, said he, or your Obstinacy, that
makes you not chuse I should read it before
you? 
I offer'd to go away; and he said, Don't
run from me; I won't read it till you are gone. 
But, said he, tell me, Pamela, whether you
comply with my Proposals, or not? Sir, said I,
you will see presently; pray don't hold me! For
he took my Hand. Said he, Did you well consider,
before you answer'd? –––I did, Sir, said I. 
If it be not what you think will please me,
said he, dear Girl, take it back again, and reconsider
it; for if I have this as your absolute
Answer, and I don't like it, you are undone; 
for I will not sue meanly, where I can command. 
I fear, continued he, it is not what I like,
by your Manner: And, let me tell you, That I
cannot bear Denial. If the Terms I have offer'd
are not sufficient, I will augment them to Two 

Thirds of my Estate; for, said he, and swore a
dreadful Oath, I cannot live without you: And
since the thing is gone so far, I will not! 
–––And so he clasp'd me in his Arms, in such a
manner as quite frighted me; and kissed me two
or three times. 
I got from him, and ran up-stairs, and
went to the Closet, and was quite uneasy and
fearful. 
In an Hour's time he call'd Mrs. Jewkes down
to him; and I heard him very high in Passion:
And all about poor me! And I heard her say, It
was his own Fault; there would be an End of
all my Complaining and Perverseness, if he was
once resolv'd; and other most impudent Aggravations. 
I am resolv'd not to go to-bed this Night,
if I can help it. —Lie still, lie still, my poor
fluttering Heart! –––What will become of me!
