Dear Father and Mother,
I am sorry to write you Word, that the
Hopes I had of going to wait on Lady Davers
are quite over. My Lady would have had
me; but my Master, as I heard by-the-bye,
would not consent to it. He said, her Nephew
might be taken with me, and I might draw
him in, or be drawn in by him; and he
thought, as his Mother loved me, and committed
me to his Care, he ought to continue me
with him; and Mrs. Jervis would be a Mother
to me. Mrs. Jervis tells me, the Lady
shook her Head, and said, Ah! Brother! and
that was all. And as you have made me fearful
by your Cautions, my Heart at times misgives
me. But I say nothing yet of your Caution,
or my own Uneasiness, to Mrs. Jervis;
not that I mistrust her, but for fear she should
think me presumptuous, and vain, and conceited,
to have any Fears about the matter,
from the great Distance between such a Gentleman,
and so poor a Girl. But yet Mrs. Jervis 

seem'd to build something upon Lady Davers'
shaking her Head, and saying, Ah! Brother!
and no more. God, I hope, will give
me his Grace; and so I will not, if I can help
it, make myself too uneasy; for I hope there
is no Occasion. But every little matter that
happens, I will acquaint you with, that you
may continue to me your good Advice, and
pray for 
Your sad-hearted Pamela.
