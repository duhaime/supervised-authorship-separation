Miss Howe, To Miss Clarissa Harlowe. 

Thursday Morning, Day-break, March 30. 
An accident, and not remissness, has occasioned
my silence. 
My Mother was sent for on Sunday night by her
cousin Larkin, whom I mentioned in one of my former,
and who was extremely earnest to see her. 

This poor woman was always afraid of death, and was
one of those weak persons who imagine that the making
of their Will must be an undoubted forerunner of it. 
She had always said, when urged to the necessary
work, That whenever she made it, she should not
live long after; and, one would think, imagined she
was under an obligation to prove her words: For,
tho' she had been long bed-rid, and was, in a manner,
worn out before, yet she thought herself better,
till she was persuaded to make it: And from that moment,
remembering what she used to prognosticate
(her fears helping on what she feared, as is often the
case, particularly in the Small-Pox) grew worse; and
had it in her head once to burn her Will, in hopes to
grow better upon it. 
She sent my Mother word, That the Doctors had
given her over: But that she could not die till she saw
her. I told my Mother, That if she wished her a
chance for recovery, she should not, for that reason,
go. But go she would; and, what was worse, would
make me go with her; and that, at an hour's warning; 
for she said nothing of it to me, till she was
rising in the morning early, resolving to return at night. 
Had there been more time for argumentation, to be
sure I had not gone; but as it was, there was a kind
of necessity that my preparation to obey her, should,
in a manner, accompany her command. —A command
so much out of the way, on such a solemn occasion! 
And this I represented: But to no purpose: There
never was such a contradicting girl in the world—My
wisdom always made her a fool! —But she would be
obliged this time, proper or improper. 
I have but one way of accounting for this sudden
whim of my Mother; and that is this—She had a
mind to accept of Mr. Hickman's offer to escorte her: 
—And I verily believe [I wish I were quite sure of it]
had a mind to oblige him with my company—As far
as I know, to keep me out of worse. 

For, would you believe it? —As sure as you are
alive, she is afraid for her favourite Hickman, because
of the long visit your Lovelace, tho' so much by accident,
made me in her absence, last time she was at
the same place. I hope, my dear, you are not jealous
too. But indeed I now-and-then, when she teazes
me with praises which Hickman cannot deserve, in
return, fall to praising those qualities and personalities
in Lovelace, which the other never will have. Indeed
I do love to teaze a little bit, that I do. —My
Mamma's girl—I had like to have said. 
As you know she is as passionate, as I am pert,
you will not wonder to be told, that we generally
fall out on these occasions. She flies from me, at the
long run. It would be undutiful in me to leave her
first—And then I get an opportunity to pursue our
correspondence. 
For, now I am rambling, let me tell you, that she
does not much favour that;—for two reasons, I believe: 
—One, That I don't shew her all that passes between
us; the other, That she thinks I harden your
mind against your duty, as it is called: And with her,
for a reason at home, as I have hinted more than once,
parents cannot do wrong; children cannot oppose,
and be right. This obliges me now-and-then to steal
an hour, as I may say, and not let her know how I
am employed. 
You may guess from what I have written, how
averse I was to comply with this unreasonable stretch
of motherly authority—But it came to be a test of duty; 
so I was obliged to yield, tho' with a full persuasion
of being in the right. 
I have always your reproofs upon these occasions: 
In your late Letters stronger than ever. A good reason
why, you'll say, Because more deserved than ever. 
I thank you kindly for your correction. I hope to
make Correction of it—But let me tell you, that
your stripes, whether deserved or not, have made 

me sensible deeper than the skin—But of this another
time. 
It was Monday afternoon before we reached the old
Lady's House. That fiddling, parading fellow [You
know who I mean] made us wait for him two hours,
and I to go a journey I disliked! only for the sake of
having a little more tawdry upon his housings; which
he had hurried his sadler to put on, to make him look
fine, being to escorte his dear Madam Howe, and
her fair Daughter. I told him, that I supposed he
was afraid, that the double solemnity in the case (that
of the visit to a dying woman, and that of his own
countenance) would give him the appearance of an undertaker; 
to avoid which, he ran into as bad an extreme,
and I doubted would be taken for a mountebank. 
The man was confounded. He took it as strongly,
as if his conscience gave assent to the justice of the remark: 
Otherwise he would have borne it better; 
for he is used enough to this sort of treatment. I
thought he would have cried. I have heretofore observed,
that on this side of the contract, he seems to
be a mighty meek sort of creature. —And tho' I should
like it in him hereafter perhaps, yet I can't help despising
him a little in my heart for it now. I believe,
my dear, we all love your blustering fellows best; 
could we but direct the bluster, and bid it roar when,
and at whom we pleased. 
The poor man looked at my Mother. She was so
angry (my airs upon it, and my opposition to the
journey, having all helped) that for half the way she
would not speak to me. And when she did, it was,
I wish I had not brought you! You know not what
it is to condescend. It is my fault, not Mr. Hickman's,
that you are here so much against your will. 
Have you no eyes for this side of the chariot? 
And then he fared the better from her, as he always
does, for faring worse from me: For there was, 

How do you now, Sir? And how do you now, Mr.
Hickman? as he ambled now on this side of the chariot,
now on that, stealing a prim look at me; her
head half out of the chariot, kindly smiling as if married
to the man but a fortnight herself: While I always
saw something to divert myself on the side of the
chariot where the honest man was not, were it but
old Robin at a distance, on his Roan Keffel. 
Our courtship-days, they say, are our best days. 
Favour destroys courtship. Distance encreases it. Its
essence is distance. And to see how familiar these
men wretches grow upon a smile, what an awe they
are struck into when we frown; who would not
make them stand off? Who would not enjoy a power,
that is to be so short-lived? 
Don't chide me one bit for this, my dear. It is in
nature. I can't help it. Nay, for that matter, I
love it, and wish not to help it. So spare your gravity,
I beseech you, on this subject. I set not up for
a perfect character. The man will bear it. And
what need you care? My Mother overbalances all he
suffers: And if he thinks himself unhappy, he ought
never to be otherwise. 
Then did he not deserve a fit of the sullens, think
you, to make us lose our dinner for his parade, since
in so short a journey my Mother would not 'bate, and
lose the opportunity of coming back that night, had
the old Lady's condition permitted it? To say nothing
of being the cause, that my Mamma was in the glout
with her poor Daughter all the way. 
At our alighting I gave him another dab; but it
was but a little one. Yet the manner, and the air,
made up (as I intended they should) for that defect. 
My Mother's hand was kindly put into his, with a
simpering altogether bridal; and with another How
do you now, Sir? —All his plump muscles were in
motion, and a double charge of care and obsequiousness
fidgetted up his whole form, when he offered to 

me his officious palm. My Mother, when I was a
girl, always bid me hold up my head. I just then remembred
her commands, and was dutiful—I never
held up my head so high. With an averted supercilious
eye, and a rejecting hand, half-flourishing—I
have no need of help, Sir! —You are in my way. 
He ran back, as if on wheels; with a face excessively
mortified: I had thoughts else to have followed
the too gentle touch, with a declaration, that I had
as many hands and feet as himself. But this would
have been telling him a piece of news, as to the latter,
that I hope he had not the presumption to guess at. 
* *
We found the poor woman, as we thought, at the
last gasp. Had we come sooner, we could not have
got away, as we intended, that night. You see I am
for excusing the man all I can; and yet, I assure you,
I have not so much as a conditional liking to him. My
Mother sat up most part of the night, expecting every
hour would have been her poor Cousin's last. I bore
her company till Two. 
I never saw the approaches of death in a grown person
before; and was extremely shocked. Death, to one
in health, is a very terrible thing. We pity the person
for what she suffers: And we pity ourselves for what
we must some time hence in like sort suffer; and so
are doubly affected. 
She held out till Tuesday Morning, Eleven. As
she had told my Mother that she had left her an Executrix,
and her and me rings and mourning; we were
employed all that day in matters of the Will [By
which, by the way, my Cousin Jenny Fynnett is handsomely
provided for]; so that it was Wednesday
morning early, before we could set out on our return. 
It is true, we got home (having no housings to stay
for) by noon: But tho' I sent Robin away before he
dismounted (who brought me back a whole packet,
down to the same Wednesday noon) yet was I really 

so fatigued, and shocked, as I must own, at the hard
death of the old Lady; my Mother likewise (who has
no reason to dislike this world) being indisposed from
the same occasion; that I could not set about writing
time enough for Robin's return that night. 
But having recruited my spirits, my Mother having
also had a good night, I arose with the dawn, to write
this, and get it dispatch'd time enough for your breakfast-airing; 
that your suspense might be as short as
possible. 
* *
I will soon follow This with another. I will employ
a person directly to find out how Lovelace behaves
himself at his Inn. Such a busy spirit must be
traceable. 
But, perhaps, my dear, you are indifferent now
about him, or his employments; for this request was
made before he mortally offended you. Nevertheless,
I will have enquiry made. The result, it is very probable,
will be of use to confirm you in your present
unforgiving temper. —And yet, if the poor man [Shall
I pity him for you, my dear?] should be deprived of
the greatest blessing any man on earth can receive, and
to which he has the presumption, with so little merit,
to aspire; he will have run great risques; caught great
colds; hazarded fevers; sustained the highest indignities; 
braved the inclemencies of skies, and all for— 
nothing! —Will not this move your generosity (if nothing
else) in his favour! —Poor Mr. Lovelace!— 
I would occasion no throb; nor half-throb; no
flash of sensibility, like lightning darting in, and as
soon suppressed by a discretion that no one of the Sex
ever before could give such an example of—I would
not, I say; and yet, for a trial of you to yourself, rather
than as an impertinent overflow of raillery in your
friend, as money-takers try a suspected guinea by the
sound, let me, on such a supposition, sound you, by
repeating, Poor Mr. Lovelace!— 

And now, my dear, how is it with you? How do
you now, as my Mother says to Mr. Hickman, when
her pert Daughter has made him look sorrowful?
