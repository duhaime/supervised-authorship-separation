the 14th, 15th and 16th of my Bondage. 

Mrs. Jewkes has received a Letter, and is
much civiller to me, and Mr. Williams too,
than she used to be. I wonder I have not one in Answer
to mine to my Master. I suppose I press'd the
Matter too home to him; and he is angry. I am
not the more pleas'd for her Civility; for she is
horrid cunning, and is not a bit less watchful. I
laid a Trap to get at her Instructions, which she
carries in the Bosom of her Stays, but it has not
succeeded. 
My last Letter is come safe to Mr. Williams, by
the old Conveyance, so that is not suspected. He
has intimated, that tho' I have not come so readily
as he hop'd into his Scheme, yet his Diligence shall
not be slacken'd, and he will leave it to Providence
and myself, to dispose of him as he shall be found
to deserve. He has signify'd to me, that he shall
soon send a special Messenger with the Pacquet to
you, and I have added to it what has occurr'd since.
