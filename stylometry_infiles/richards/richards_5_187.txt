Lady G. To the Right Honourable the Earl of G. 


Selby-house, Aug. 4.
O My dear Lord! what do you mean? Are you
and Lady Gertrude really angry with me? I
cannot bear the serious conclusion of your Letter. 
May you both live long, and be happy! If my affectionate
duty to you both will contribute to your felicity,
it shall not be wanting. I was so happy here,
that I knew not when I should have returned to town,
had you not, so kindly as to your intention, yet so severely
in your expressions, admonished me. I will
soon throw myself at your feet; and by the next post
will fix the day on which I hope to be forgiven by
you both. Let Lord G. answer for himself. Upon
my word he is as much to blame as I am; nay, more; 
for he dotes upon Miss Byron. 
Duty I avow: Pardon I beg: Never more, my
dear and honoured Lord, shall you have like reason to
chide 
Your ever-dutiful Daughter,
Nor you, my dear Lady Gertrude,
Your most obedient Kinswoman,
Charlotte G.
