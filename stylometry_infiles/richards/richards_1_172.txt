Mr. Hickman, To Miss Clarissa Harlowe. 
[Sent to Wilson's by a particular hand.] 

Friday, May 5. 
Madam,
I have the honour of dear Miss Howe's commands,
to acquaint you, without knowing the occasion,
‘That she is excessively concerned for the concern she
has given you in her last Letter: And that, if you
will but write to her, under cover as before, she will
have no thoughts of what you are so very apprehensive
about.’ —Yet she bid me write, ‘That if she has
but the least imagination that she can serve you, and
save you,’ those are her words, ‘all the censures of
the world will be but of second consideration with
her.’ 
I have great temptations on this occasion, to
express my own resentments upon your present state; 
but not being fully apprised of what that is—only conjecturing
from the disturbance upon the mind of the
dearest Lady in the world to me, and the most sincere
of friends to you, that that is not altogether so happy
as were to be wished; and being, moreover, forbid to
enter into the cruel subject; I can only offer, as I do,
my best and faithfullest services; and wish you a happy
deliverance from all your troubles. For I am, 
Most excellent young Lady,
Your faithful and most obedient Servant,
Ch. Hickman.
