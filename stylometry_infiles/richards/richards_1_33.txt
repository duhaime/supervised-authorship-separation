Mr. Lovelace, To John Belford, Esq; 

Monday, March 13. 
In vain dost thou (a)  and thy compeers press me
to go to town, while I am in such an uncertainty
as I am in at present with this proud Beauty. All 

the ground I have hitherto gained with her, is entirely
owing to her concern for the safety of people whom I
have reason to hate. 
Write then, thou biddest me, if I will not come. 
That, indeed, I can do; and as well without a subject,
as with one. And what follows shall be a proof
of it. 
The Lady's malevolent Brother has now, as I told
thee at M. Hall, introduced another man; the most
unpromising in his person and qualities, the most formidable
in his offers, that has yet appeared. 
This man has by his proposals captivated every soul
of the Harlowes—Soul! did I say—There is not a
soul among them but my Charmer's: And she, withstanding
them All, is actually confined, and otherwise
maltreated by a Father the most gloomy and positive; 
at the instigation of a Brother the most arrogant and
selfish—But thou knowest their characters; and I will
not therefore sully my Paper with them. 
But is it not a confounded thing to be in Love with
one, who is the Daughter, the Sister, the Niece, of
a family I must eternally despise? And, the devil of
it, That Love increasing, with her—What shall I
call it? —'Tis not scorn: —'Tis not pride: —'Tis not
the insolence of an adored Beauty: —But 'tis to Virtue,
it seems, that my difficulties are owing; and I
pay for not being a sly sinner, an hypocrite; for being
regardless of my reputation; for permitting slander
to open its mouth against me. But is it necessary for
such a one as I, who have been used to carry all before
me, upon my own terms—I, who never inspired
a Fear, that had not a discernibly-predominant mixture
of Love in it; to be an hypocrite? —Well says
the poet: 

He who seems virtuous does but act a part;
And shews not his own Nature, but his Art.
Well, but it seems I must practise for This Art, 

if I would succeed with this truly admirable creature! 
But why practise for it? —Cannot I indeed reform? — 
I have but one vice;—Have I, Jack? —Thou knowest
my heart, if any man living does. As far as I know
it myself, thou knowest it. But 'tis a cursed deceiver; 
for it has many and many a time imposed upon its
master—Master, did I say? That am I not now; 
nor have I been from the moment I beheld this angel
of a woman. Prepared indeed as I was by her character
before I saw her: For what a mind must that
be, which tho' not virtuous itself, admires not virtue
in another? —My visit to Arabella, owing to a mistake
of the Sisters, into which, as thou hast heard
me say, I was led by the blundering Uncle; who was
to introduce me (but lately come from abroad) to the
Divinity, as I thought; but, instead of her, carried
me to a mere mortal. And much difficulty had I, so
fond and so forward my Lady! to get off without
forfeiting All with a family that I intended should give
me a Goddess. 
I have boasted, that I was once in Love before: — 
And indeed I thought I was. It was in my early
manhood—with that Quality-jilt, whose infidelity I
have vowed to revenge upon as many of the Sex as
shall come into my power. I believe, in different
climes, I have already sacrificed an Hecatomb to my
Nemesis, in pursuance of this vow. But upon recollecting
what I was then, and comparing it with
what I find in myself now, I cannot say that I was
ever in Love before. 
What was it then, dost thou ask me, since the disappointment
had such effects upon me, when I found
myself jilted, that I was hardly kept in my senses? — 
Why, I'll tell thee what, as near as I can remember; 
for it was a great while ago: —It was—Egad, Jack, I
can hardly tell what it was—But a vehement aspiration
after a novelty, I think—Those confounded
Poets, with their terrenely-celestial descriptions, did as 

much with me as the Lady: They fired my imagination,
and set me upon a desire to become a goddess-maker. 
I must needs try my new-fledged pinions in
Sonnet, Elogy, and Madrigal. I must have a Cynthia,
a Stella, a Sacharissa, as well as the best of
them: Darts, and flames, and the devil knows what,
must I give to my Cupid. I must create Beauty, and
place it where nobody else could find it: And many
a time have I been at a loss for a subject, when my
new-created goddess has been kinder than it was proper
for my plaintive Sonnet that she should be. 
Then I had a Vanity of another sort in my passion: 
I found myself well-received among the women in
general; and I thought it a pretty lady-like tyranny
[I was then very young, and very vain!] to single
out some one of the Sex, to make half a score jealous. 
And I can tell thee, it had its effect: For many an
eye have I made to sparkle with rival indignation: 
Many a cheek glow; and even many a fan have I
caused to be snapped at a Sister-beauty; accompanied
with a reflection perhaps at being seen alone with a
wild young fellow who could not be in private with
both at once. 
In short, Jack, it was more Pride than Love, as I
now find it, that put me upon making such a confounded
rout about losing this noble varletess. I thought
she loved me at least as well as I believed I loved her: 
Nay, I had the vanity to suppose she could not help
it. My friends were pleased with my choice. They
wanted me to be shackled: For early did they doubt
my morals, as to the Sex. They saw, that the danceing,
the singing, the musical Ladies were all fond of
my company: For who [I am in a humour to be vain,
I think!—for who] danced, who sung, who touched
the string, whatever the instrument, with a better grace
than thy friend? 
I have no notion of playing the hypocrite so egregiously,
as to pretend to be blind to qualifications 

which every one sees and acknowleges. Such praise-begging
hypocrisy! Such affectedly disclaimed attributes! 
Such contemptible praise-traps! —But yet,
shall my vanity extend only to personals, such as the
gracefulness of dress, my debonnaire, and my assureance
—Self-taught, self-acquired, these! —For my
Parts, I value not myself upon them. Thou wilt say,
I have no cause. —Perhaps not: But if I had anything
valuable as to intellectuals, those are not my
own; and to be proud of what a man is answerable
for the abuse of, and has no merit in the right use of,
is to strut, like the jay, in a borrowed plumage. 
But to return to my fair jilt—I could not bear,
that a woman, who was the first that had bound me
in silken fetters [they were not iron ones, like those I
now wear] should prefer a coronet to me: And when
the bird was flown, I set more value upon it, than
when I had it safe in my cage, and could visit it when
I pleased. 
But now am I indeed in Love. I can think of
nothing, of nobody, but the divine Clarissa Harlowe. 
—Harlowe! —How that hated word sticks in
my throat—But I shall give her for it the name of
Love (a) . 

Clarissa! O there's music in the name,
That, soft'ning me to infant tenderness,
Makes my heart spring like the first leaps of life!
But couldst thou have believed that I, who think it
possible for me to favour as much as I can be favoured; 
that I, who for this charming creature think of foregoing
the life of honour for the life of shackles; could
adopt those over-tender lines of Otway? 
I check myself, and leaving the three first Lines of
the following of Dryden to the family of the whiners,
find the workings of the passion in my stormy soul
better expressed by the three last: 


Love various minds does variously inspire:
He stirs in gentle natures gentle fire;
Like that of incense on the altar laid.
But raging flames tempestuous souls invade:
A fire, which ev'ry windy passion blows;
With Pride it mounts, and with Revenge it glows.
And with Revenge it shall glow! —For, dost
thou think, that if it were not from the hope, that
this stupid family are all combined to do my work for
me, I would bear their insults? —Is it possible to
imagine, that I would be braved as I am braved,
threatened as I am threatened, by those who are afraid
to see me; and by this brutal Brother too, to whom
I gave a life [A life, indeed, not worth my taking!]; 
had I not a greater pride in knowing, that by means
of his very Spy upon me, I am playing him off as I
please; cooling or inflaming his violent passions as
may best suit my purposes; permitting so much to be
revealed of my life and actions, and intentions, as
may give him such a confidence in his double-faced
agent, as shall enable me to dance his employer upon
my own wires? 
This it is that makes my Pride mount above my
Resentment. By this engine, whose springs I am
continually oiling, I play them all off. The busy old
tarpaulin Uncle I make but my embassador to Queen
Annabella Howe, to engage her (for example-sake
to her Princessly daughter) to join in their cause, and
to assert an authority they are resolved, right or wrong,
(or I could do nothing) to maintain. 
And what my motive, dost thou ask? No less than
this, That my Beloved shall find no protection out of
my family; for, if I know hers, fly she must, or have
the man she hates. This, therefore, if I take my
measures right, and my Familiar fail me not, will
secure her mine, in spite of them all; in spite of
her own inflexible heart: Mine, without condition; 

without reformation-promises; without the necessity
of a siege of years, perhaps; and to be even then,
after wearing the guise of a merit-doubting hypocrisy,
at an uncertainty, upon a probation unapproved of— 
Then shall I have all the rascals and rascalesses of the
family come creeping to me: I prescribing to them; 
and bringing that sordidly-imperious Brother to kneel
at the footstool of my throne. 
All my fear arises from the little hold I have in the
heart of this charming Frost-piece: Such a constant
glow upon her lovely features: Eyes so sparkling: 
Limbs so divinely turned: Health so florid: Youth
so blooming: Air so animated—To have an heart so
impenetrable: And I, the hitherto successful Lovelace,
the addresser—How can it be? Yet there are
people, and I have talked with some of them, who
remember that she was born. Her nurse Norton
boasts of her maternal offices in her earliest infancy; 
and in her education gradatim. So that there is full
proof, that she came not from above all at once an
angel! How then can she be so impenetrable? 
But here's her mistake; nor will she be cured of
it—She takes the man she calls her Father [Her Mother
had been faultless, had she not been her Father's
Wife]; she takes the men she calls her Uncles; the
fellow she calls her Brother; and the poor contemptible
she calls her Sister; to be her Father, to be her
Uncles, her Brother, her Sister; and that, as such,
she owes to some of them reverence, to others respect,
let them treat her ever so cruelly! —Sordid
ties! Mere cradle-prejudices! —For had they not
been imposed upon her by Nature, when she was in
a perverse humour, or could she have chosen her
relations, Would any of these have been among
them? 
How my heart rises at her preference of them to
me, when she is convinced of their injustice to me! 
Convinced, that the alliance would do honour to them 

all—herself excepted; to whom every one owes honour; 
and from whom the most princely family
might receive it. But how much more will my heart
rise with indignation against her, if I find she hesitates
but one moment (however persecuted) about preferring
me to the man she avowedly hates! But she cannot
surely be so mean as to purchase her peace with
them at so dear a rate. She cannot give a sanction to
projects formed in malice, and founded in a selfishness
(and that at her own expence) which she has spirit
enough to despise in others; and ought to disavow,
that we may not think her a Harlowe. 
By this incoherent ramble thou wilt gather, that I
am not likely to come up in haste; since I must endeavour
first to obtain some assurance from the Beloved
of my soul, that I shall not be sacrificed to such
a wretch as Solmes! Woe be to the Fair-one, if ever
she be driven into my power (for I despair of a voluntary
impulse in my favour) and I find a difficulty in
obtaining this security. 
That her indifference to me is not owing to the
superior liking she has for any other man, is what
rivets my chains: But take care, Fair-one; take
care, O thou most exalted of female minds, and loveliest
of persons, how thou debasest thyself, by encouraging
such a competition as thy sordid relations have
set on foot in mere malice to me! —Thou wilt say I
rave. And so I do: 

Perdition catch my soul, but I do love her.
Else, could I bear the perpetual revilings of her
implacable family? —Else, could I basely creep about-not
her proud Father's house—but his paddock—and
garden-walls? —Yet (a quarter of a mile's distance
between us) not hoping to behold the least glimpse
of her shadow? —Else, should I think myself repaid,
amply repaid, if the fourth, fifth, or sixth midnight
stroll, thro' unfrequented paths, and over briery inclosures, 

affords me a few cold lines; the even expected
purport only to let me know, that she values
the most worthless person of her very worthless family,
more than she values me; and that she would not
write at all, but to induce me to bear insults, which
un-man me to bear? —My lodging in the intermediate
way, at a wretched alehouse; disguised like an inmate
of it: Accommodations equally vile, as those I met
with in my Westphalian journey. 'Tis well, that the
necessity for all This arises not from scorn and tyranny; 
but is first imposed upon herself! 
But was ever hero in Romance (fighting with giants
and dragons excepted) called upon to harder trials? — 
Fortune and family, and reversionary grandeur, on
my side! Such a wretched fellow my competitor! — 
Must I not be deplorably in Love, that can go thro'
these difficulties, encounter these contempts? —By my
soul, I am half-ashamed of myself: I, who am perjured
too, by priority of obligation, if I am faithful
to any woman in the world! 
And yet, why say I, I am half-ashamed? —Is it
not a glory to love her whom every one who sees her,
either loves, or reveres, or both? Dryden says, 

The Cause of Love can never be assign'd:
'Tis in no face;—But in the Lover's mind.
—And Cowley thus addresses Beauty as a mere imaginary: 

 Beauty! thou wild fantastic ape,
Who dost in ev'ry country change they shape:
Here black; there brown; here tawny; and there white;
Thou flatt'rer! who comply'st with ev'ry sight!
 Who hast no certain What, nor Where.
But both these, had they been her cotemporaries, and
known her, would have confessed themselves mistaken: 
And, taking together person, mind, and behaviour, 

would have acknowleged the justice of the universal
voice in her favour. 

—Full many a Lady
I've ey'd with best regard; and many a time
Th' harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
Brought my too diligent ear. For sev'ral virtues
Have I lik'd sev'ral women. Never any
With so full soul, but some defect in her
Did quarrel with the noblest grace she ow'd,
And put it to the foil. But She!—O She!
So perfect and so peerless is created,
Of ev'ry creature's best.
Shakesp.
Thou art curious to know, If I have not started a
new game? —If it be possible for so universal a Lover
to be confined so long to one object? Thou knowest
nothing of this charming creature, that thou canst put
such questions to me; or thinkest thou knowest me
better than thou dost. All that's excellent in her Sex
is this Lady! —Until by Matrimonial, or EQUAL
intimacies, I have found her less than angel, it is impossible
to think of any other. Then there are so
many stimulatives to such a spirit as mine in this
affair, besides Love: Such a field for stratagem and
contrivance, which thou knowest to be the delight of
my heart. Then the rewarding end of all! —To
carry off such a girl as this, in spite of all her watchful
and implacable friends; and in spite of a prudence
and reserve that I never met with in any of
the Sex: —What a triumph! —What a triumph over
the whole Sex! —And then such a Revenge to gratify; 
which is only at present politically reined-in,
eventually to break forth with the greater fury—Is it
possible, thinkest thou, that there can be room for
a thought that is not of her, and devoted to her? 
* *
By the advices I have this moment received, I have
reason to think, that I shall have occasion for thee 

here. Hold thyself in readiness to come down upon
the first summons. 
Let Belton, and Mowbray, and Tourville, likewise
prepare themselves. I have a great mind to contrive
a method to send James Harlowe to travel for
improvement. Never was there Booby 'Squire that
more wanted it. Contrive it, did I say? I have already
contrived it; could I but put it in execution
without being suspected to have a hand in it. This I
am resolved upon; If I have not his Sister, I will have
Him. 
But be This as it may, there is a present likelihood
of room for glorious mischief. A confederacy had
been for some time formed against me; but the Uncles
and the Nephew are now to be double-servanted [single-servanted
they were before]; and those servants are
to be double-armed when they attend their masters
abroad. This indicates their resolute enmity to me,
and as resolute favour to Solmes. 
The reinforced orders for this hostile apparatus are
owing it seems to a visit I made yesterday to their
Church—A good place I thought to begin a Reconciliation
in; supposing the heads of the family to be
Christians, and that they meant something by their
prayers. My hopes were to have an invitation (or,
at least, to gain a pretence) to accompany home the
gloomy Sire; and so get an opportunity to see my
goddess: For I believed they durst not but be civil
to me, at least. But they were filled with terror it
seems at my entrance; a terror they could not get
over. I saw it indeed in their countenances; and that
they all expected something extraordinary to follow. — 
And so it should have done, had I been more sure than
I am of their Daughter's favour. Yet not a hair of
any of their stupid heads do I intend to hurt. 
You shall all have your directions in writing, if
there be occasion. But after all, I dare say there will
be no need but to shew your faces in my company. 

Such faces never could four men shew—Mowbray's
so fierce and so fighting: Belton's so pert and so
pimply: Tourville's so fair and so foppish: Thine so
rough and so resolute: And I your Leader! —What
hearts, altho' meditating hostility, must those be which
we shall not appall? —Each man occasionally attended
by a servant or two, long ago chosen for qualities resembling
those of his master. 
Thus, Jack, as thou desirest, have I written. — 
Written upon Something; upon Nothing; upon Revenge,
which I love; upon Love, which I hate,
heartily hate, because 'tis my master: And upon the
devil knows what besides: —For, looking back, I am
amazed at the length of it. Thou may'st read it: I
would not for a King's ransom—But so as I do but
write, thou sayest thou wilt be pleased. 
Be pleased then. I command thee to be pleased: If
not for the writer's or written's sake, for thy word's
sake. And so in the royal style (for am I not likely
to be thy King and thy Emperor in the great affair before
us?) I bid Thee very heartily 
Farewel.
