Miss Clarissa Harlowe, To Miss Howe. 

Jan. 20. 
I have been hindered from prosecuting my intention. 
Neither nights nor mornings have been 

my own. My Mother has been very ill; and would
have no other nurse but me. I have not stirred from
her bedside (for she kept her bed); and two nights I
had the honour of sharing it with her. 
Her disorder was a very violent Colic. The contentions
of these fierce, these masculine spirits, and the
apprehension of mischiefs that may arise from the
encreasing animosity which all here have against Mr.
Lovelace, and his too-well known resenting and intrepid
character, she cannot bear. Then the foundations
laid, as she dreads, for jealousy and heart-burnings in
her own family, late so happy and so united, afflict exceedingly
a gentle and sensible mind, which has from
the beginning, on all occasions, sacrificed its own inward
satisfaction to outward peace. My Brother and
Sister, who used very often to jar, are now so entirely
one, and are so much together (caballing was the word
that dropped from my Mother's lips, as if at unawares)
that she is very fearful of the consequences
that may follow;—to my prejudice, perhaps, is her
kind concern; since she sees that they behave to me
every hour with more and more shyness and reserve: 
Yet, would she but exert that authority which the
superiority of her fine talents gives her, all these family-feuds
might perhaps be extinguished in their but-yet
beginnings; especially as she may be assured that
all fitting concessions shall be made by me, not only
as my Brother and Sister are my Elders, but for the
sake of so excellent and so indulgent a Mother. 
For, if I may say to you, my dear, what I would
not to any other person living, it is my opinion, that
had she been of a temper that would have borne less,
she would have had ten times less to bear than she
has had. No commendation, you'll say, of the generosity
of those spirits which can turn to its own disquiet
so much condescending goodness. 
Upon my word I am sometimes tempted to think
that we may make the world allow for and respect us 

as we please, if we can but be sturdy in our wills, and
set out accordingly. It is but being the less beloved
for it, that's all: And if we have power to oblige
those we have to do with, it will not appear to us
that we are. Our flatterers will tell us any-thing
sooner than our faults, or what they know we do not
like to hear. 
Were there not truth in this observation, is it possible
that my Brother and Sister could make their very
failings, their vehemences, of such importance to all
the family? ‘How will my Son, how will my Nephew,
take this or that measure? What will he say
to it? Let us consult him about it;’ are references
always previous to every resolution taken by his superiors,
whose will ought to be his. Well may he expect
to be treated with this deference by every other
person, when my Father himself, generally so absolute,
constantly pays it to him; and the more since his
Godmother's bounty has given independence to a spirit
that was before under too little restraint. —But whither
may these reflections lead me! —I know you do
not love any of us but my mother and me; and, being
above all disguises, make me sensible that you do
not oftener than I wish. —Ought I then to add forces
to your dislikes of those whom I wish you to like?— 
of my Father especially; for he, alas! has some excuse
for his impatience of contradiction. He is not naturally
an ill-temper'd man; and in his person and air,
and in his conversation too, when not under the torture
of a gouty paroxysm, every-body distinguishes
the gentleman born and educated. 
Our Sex perhaps must expect to bear a little—uncourtliness
shall I call it?—from the Husband whom
as the Lover they let know the preference their hearts
gave him to all other men. —Say what they will of
generosity being a manly virtue; but upon my word,
my dear, I have ever yet observed, that it is not to
be met with in that Sex one time in ten that it is to be 

found in ours. —But my Father was soured by the
cruel distemper I have named; which seized him all
at once in the very prime of life, in so violent a manner
as to take from the most active of minds, as his
was, all power of activity, and that in all appearance
for life. —It imprisoned, as I may say, his lively spirits
in himself, and turned the edge of them against his
own peace; his extraordinary prosperity adding to his
impatiency. Those, I believe, who want the fewest
earthly blessings, most regret that they want any. 
But my Brother! what excuse can be made for his
haughty and morose temper? He is really, my dear,
I am sorry to have occasion to say it, an ill-temper'd
young man; and treats my Mother sometimes—Indeed
he is not dutiful. —But, possessing every-thing,
he has the vice of age mingled with the ambition of
youth, and enjoys nothing—but his own haughtiness
and ill-temper, I was going to say. —Yet again am I
adding force to your dislikes of some of us. —Once,
my dear, it was perhaps in your power to have
moulded him as you pleased. —Could you have been
my Sister! —Then had I had a Friend in a Sister. — 
But no wonder that he does not love you now; who
could nip in the bud, and that with a disdain, let me
say, too much of kin to his haughtiness, a passion that
would not have wanted a fervor worthy of the object; 
and which possibly would have made him worthy. 
But no more of this. I will prosecute my former
intention in my next; which I will sit down to as soon
as breakfast is over; dispatching this by the messenger
whom you have so kindly sent to enquire after us on
my silence. Mean time, I am, 
Your most affectionate and obliged
Friend and Servant,
Cl. Harlowe.
