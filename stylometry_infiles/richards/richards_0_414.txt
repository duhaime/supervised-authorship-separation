Mr. Lovelace, To John Belford, Esq; 

Tuesday, Aug. 15. 
Thank thee, Jack, most heartily I thank thee, for
the sober conclusion of thy last! —I have a good
mind, for the sake of it, to forgive thy till-now absolutely
unpardonable extracts. 
But dost think I will lose such an angel, such a forgiving
angel, as this? —By my soul, I will not! —To pray for
mercy for such an ingrateful miscreant! —How she wounds,
how she cuts me to the soul, by her exalted generosity! — 
But She must have mercy upon me first! —Then will she
teach me a reliance, for the sake of which her prayer for
me will be answered. 
But hasten, hasten to me, particulars of her health, of
her employments, of her conversation. 
I am sick only of love! —O that I could have called
her mine! —It would then have been worth while to be 

sick! —To have sent for her down to me from town; and
to have had her, with healing in her dove-like wings, flying
to my comfort; her duty and her choice to pray for
me, and to bid me live for her sake! —O Jack! what an
angel have I— 
But I have not lost her! —I will not lose her! I am almost
well; should be quite well but for these prescribing
rascals, who, to do credit to their skill, will make the disease
of importance. —And I will make her mine! —And be
sick again, to intitle myself to her dutiful tenderness, and
pious as well as personal concern! 
God for ever bless her! —Hasten, hasten particulars of
her! —I am sick of love! —Such generous goodness! — 
by all that's great and good, I will not lose her! So tell
her! —She says, That she could not pity me, if she
thought of being mine! This, according to Miss Howe's
transcriptions to Charlotte—But bid her hate me, and
have me: And my behaviour to her shall soon turn that
hate to love! —For, body and mind, I will be wholly hers.
