Miss Jervois, To Sir Charles Grandison. 


Friday, Nov. 10.
No sooner, dear and honoured Sir, is one boon
granted me, but I have another to beg; yet I
blush as I write, for my troublesomeness. I told you, 

Sir, I had furnished myself with new cloaths, on a
very joyful occasion—Indeed it is on a very joyful occasion. 
You would lay me under a new obligation to
your goodness, if you would be pleased to allow me
to attend Lady G. in her journey down. I shall
know, by this fresh favour, that you have quite forgiven
your dutiful ward. I presume not to add another
word—But I dare say, dear Miss Byron, that now
is, will not be against it, if you are not. —God bless
you, my honoured good Sir—But God, I hope, I am
sure, will bless you; and so shall I, as surely I ought,
whether you grant this favour, or not, to 
Your ever obliged, and grateful
Emily Jervois.
