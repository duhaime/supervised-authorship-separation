Miss Howe, To Mrs. Judith Norton. 

Saturday Evening, May 13. 
Dear good Woman,
Your beloved's honour is inviolate! —Must be
inviolate! And will be so, in spite of men and
devils. Could I have had hope of a reconciliation,
all my view was, that she should not have had this
man! —All that can be said now is, She must run the
risk of a bad husband: She of whom no man living
is worthy. 
You pity her mother! —So don't I! —I pity nobody,
that puts it out of their power to shew maternal
love, and humanity, in order to patch up for themselves
a precarious and sorry quiet, which every blast
of wind shall disturb! 
I hate tyrants in every form and shape: But paternal
and maternal tyrants are the worst of all: For they
can have no bowels. 
I repeat, that I pity none of them! —My beloved
and your beloved only deserves pity. She had never
been in the hands of this man, but for them. She is
quite blameless. You don't know all her story. 
Were I to tell you she had no intention to go off with
this man, it would avail her nothing. It would only 

condemn those who drove her to extremities; and
him, who now must be her refuge. I am 
Your sincere friend and servant,
Anna Howe.
