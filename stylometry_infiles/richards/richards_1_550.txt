Mr. Lovelace, To John Belford, Esq; 

Munich, Nov. 11–22. 
I received yours this moment, just as I was setting
out for Vienna. 
As to going to Madrid, or one single step out of the
way, to avoid Colonel Morden, let me perish, if I do! 
You cannot think me so mean a wretch. 
And so you own, that he has threatened me; but
not in gross and ungentlemanly terms, you say. If he
has threatened me like a gentleman, I will resent his
threats like a gentleman. But he has not done as a man
of honour, if he has threatened me at all behind my
back. I would scorn to threaten any man to whom I
knew how to address myself either personally, or by pen
and ink. 
As to what you mention of my guilt; of the handwriting
on the wall; of a legal prosecution, if he meet
his fate from my hand; of his skill, coolness, courage,
and such-like poltroon stuff; what can you mean by it? 
Surely you cannot believe, that such insinuations as those
will weaken either my hands or my heart. —No more of
this sort of nonsense, I beseech you, in any of your
future Letters. 
He had not taken any resolutions, you say, when you
saw him. He must and will take resolutions, one way
or other, very quickly; for I wrote to him yesterday,
without waiting for this your answer to my last. I could
not avoid it. I could not (as I told you in that) live in
suspense. I have directed my Letter to Florence. Nor
could I suffer my friends to live in suspense as to my
safety. But I have couched it in such moderate terms,
that he has fairly his option. He will be the challenger,
if he take it in the sense in which he may so handsomely
avoid taking it. And if he does, it will demonstrate
that malice and revenge were the predominant passions
with him; and that he was determined but to settle his 

affairs, and then take his resolutions, as you phrase it. — 
Yet, if we are to meet [for I know what my option
would be, in his case, on such a Letter, complaisant as
it is] I wish he had a worse, I a better cause. It would
be sweet revenge to him, were I to fall by his hand. 
But what should I be the better for killing him? 
I will inclose the copy of the Letter I sent him. 
* *
On reperusing yours in a cooler moment, I cannot
but thank you for your friendly love, and good intentions. 
My value for you, from the first hour of our
acquaintance till now, I have never found misplaced; 
regarding at least your intention: Thou must, however,
own a good deal of blunder of the over-do and under-do
kind, with respect to the part thou actedst between me
and the Beloved of my heart. But thou art really an
honest fellow, and a sincere and warm friend. I could
almost wish I had not written to Florence till I had received
thy Letter now before me. But it is gone. Let
it go. If he wish peace, and to avoid violence, he will
have a fair opportunity to embrace the one, and shun
the other. —If not—he must take his fate. 
But be this as it may, you may contrive to let young
Harlowe know [He is a menacer too!] that I shall be
in England in March next, at farthest. 
This of Bavaria is a gallant and polite Court. Nevertheless,
being uncertain whether my Letter may meet
with the Colonel at Florence, I shall quit it, and set
out, as I intended, for Vienna; taking care to have
any Letter or Message from him conveyed to me there: 
Which will soon bring me back hither, or to any other
place to which I shall be invited. 
As I write to Charlotte, I have nothing more to add,
after compliments to all friends, than that I am 
Wholly Yours,
Lovelace. 


Mr. Lovelace, To William Morden, Esq;
[Inclosed in the above.]
Munich, Nov. 10–21. 
Sir,
I have heard, with a great deal of surprize, that you
have thought fit to throw out some menacing expressions
against me. 
I should have been very glad, that you had thought I
had punishment enough in my own mind, for the wrongs
I have done to the most excellent of women; and that
it had been possible for two persons so ardently joining
in one Love (especially as I was desirous, to the utmost
of my power, to repair those wrongs) to have lived, if
not on amicable terms, in such a way, as not to put
Either to the pain of hearing of threatenings thrown
out in absence, which Either ought to be despised for,
if he had not spirit to take notice of them. 
Now, Sir, if what I have heard be owing only to
warmth of temper, or to sudden passion, while the loss
of all other losses the most deplorable to me was recent,
I not only excuse, but commend you for it. But if you
are really determined to meet me on any other account
[which, I own to you, is not however what I wish] it
would be very blameable, and very unworthy of the
character I desire to maintain as well with you as with
every other gentleman, to give you a difficulty in doing
it. 
Being uncertain when this Letter may meet you, I
shall set out to-morrow for Vienna; where any Letter
directed to the post-house in that city, or to Baron
Windisgratz's (at the Favorita) to whom I have commendations,
will come to hand. 
Mean time, believing you to be a man too generous
to make a wrong construction of what I am going to
declare, and knowing the value which the dearest of all
creatures had for you, and your relation to her, I will
not scruple to assure you, that the most acceptable return 

will be, that Colonel Morden chuses to be upon
an amicable, rather than upon any other footing, with 
His sincere Admirer, and humble Servant,
R. Lovelace.
