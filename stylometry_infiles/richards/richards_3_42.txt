For my part, I knew it in vain, to expect to have
Leave to go to Church now, and so I did not ask; 
and I was the more indifferent, because, if I might
have had Permission, the Sight of the neighbouring
Gentry, who had despis'd my Sufferings, would have
given me great Regret and Sorrow, and it was impossible 

I should have edify'd under any Doctrine
preached by Mr. Peters: So I apply'd myself to my
private Devotions. 
Mr. Williams came Yesterday, and this Day, as
usual, and took my Letter; but having no good Opportunity,
we avoided one another's Conversation,
and kept at a Distance: But I was concern'd I had
not the Key; for I would not have lost a Moment
in that Case, had it been me. When I was at my
Devotions, Mrs. Jewkes came up, and wanted me
sadly to sing her a Psalm, as she had often on common
Days importun'd me for a Song upon the
Spinnet; but I declin'd it, because my Spirits were
so low, I could hardly speak, nor car'd to be spoke
to; but when she was gone, I remembering the
137th Psalm to be a little touching, turn'd to it,
and took the Liberty to alter it to my Case more; 
I hope I did not sin in it: But thus I turn'd it. 


I.
When sad I sat in B&wblank;n-hall,
 All watched round about,
And thought of ev'ry absent Friend,
 The Tears for Grief burst out.


II.
My Joys and Hopes all overthrown,
 My Heart strings almost broke,
Unfit my Mind for Melody,
 Much more to bear a Joke;


III.
Then she to whom I Prisoner was,
 Said to me tauntingly,
Now chear your Heart, and sing a Song,
 And tune your Mind to Joy.



IV.
Alas! said I, how can I frame
 My heavy Heart to sing;
Or tune my Mind, while thus inthrall'd
 By such a wicked Thing!


V.
But yet, if from my Innocence
 I, ev'n in Thought, should slide,
Then let my Fingers quite forget
 The sweet Spinnet to guide.


VI.
And let my Tongue within my Mouth
 Be lock'd for ever fast,
If I rejoice, before I see
 My full Deliv'r ance past.


VII.
And thou, Almighty, recompence
 The Evils I endure,
From those who seek my sad Disgrace,
 So causeless, to procure.


VIII.
Remember, Lord, this Mrs. Jewkes,
 When with a mighty Sound,
She cries, Down with her Chastity,
 Down to the very Ground!


IX.
Ev'n so shalt thou, O wicked One,
 At length to Shame be brought;
And happy shall all those be call'd
 That my Deliv'r ance wrought.



X.
Yea, blessed shall the Man be call'd
 That shames thee of thy Evil,
And saves me from thy vile Attempts,
 And thee, too, from the D&wblank;l.
