Lady G. To Lady L. 


Selby-house, Monday, July 24* .
Lord bless me, my dear, what shall we do! 
My brother, in all probability, may, by this time! 
—But I cannot, cannot tell how to suppose it! — 
Ah the poor Harriet! The three Letters from my
brother, which, by the permission of Dr. Bartlett, I
inclose, will shew you, that the Italian affair is now
at a crisis. 
Read them in this place; and return them sealed
up, and directed for the Doctor.
