Lady Clementina, To Sir Charles Grandison. 


Friday morning, Febr. 16. O. S. 
I received yours but this moment. What can
I say to the contents? I wish to see you; but
dare not. Your happiness, you say, depends upon
an interview with me. Why do you tell me it does? 
I wish you happy. Yet, if you wished me so, you
would have told me how my dear friends in Italy do. 
This omission was designed. It was not generous in
the Chevalier Grandison. It was made to extort from
me a favour, which you thought I should otherwise be
unwilling to grant. 
But can you forgive the rash Clementina? God is
merciful as well as just. You imitate him. But how
can Clementina, humbled as she is, be sunk so low,
as to appear a delinquent, before the man she respects
for a character which, great as she thought it before,
has risen upon her since her arrival in England? 
But, Sir, can you, will you, engage, that my friends
will allow me to continue single? Can you answer, in
particular, for the discontinuance of the Count of Belvedere's
addresses? Can you procure forgiveness, not
only for me, but my poor Laura? Will you take into
your service, or recommend him effectually to
that of some one of your friends, in some manner
that is not altogether servile, the honest youth who
has behaved unexceptionably in mine? For he wishes
not to return to Italy. 
Answer me these few easy and plain questions; and
you will hear further from 
Clementina.
