Miss Clarissa Harlowe, To Miss Howe. 

Jan. 13, 14. 
And thus, as Mr. Lovelace thought fit to take it,
had he his answer from my Sister. It was with
very great regret, as he pretended [I doubt the man
is an hypocrite, my dear] that he acquiesced in it. 
‘So much determinedness; such a noble firmness in
my Sister; that there was no hope of prevailing upon 

her to alter sentiments she had adopted on full consideration.’ 
He sighed, as Bella told us, when he
took his leave of her: ‘Profoundly sighed; grasped
her hand, and kissed it with such an ardor—Withdrew
with such an air of solemn respect—She had
him then before her. —She could almost find in her
heart, altho' he had vexed her, to pity him.’ A
good intentional preparative to Love, this pity; since,
at the time, she little thought that he would not
renew his offer. 
He waited on my Mother after he had taken leave
of Bella, and reported his ill success in so respectful a
manner, as well with regard to my Sister as to the
whole Family, and with so much concern that he
was not accepted as a relation to it, that it left upon
them all (my Brother being then, as I have said, in
Scotland) impressions in his favour, and a belief that
this matter would certainly be brought on again. But
Mr. Lovelace going up directly to town, where he
stayed a whole fortnight, and meeting there with my
Uncle Antony, to whom he regretted his Niece's
cruel resolution not to change her State; it was seen
that there was a total end of the affair. 
My Sister was not wanting to herself on this occasion. 
She made a virtue of necessity; and the man
was quite another man with her. ‘A vain creature!
too well knowing his advantages: Yet those not what
she had conceived them to be! —Cool and warm by
fits and starts; an ague-like Lover. A steady man,
a man of virtue, a man of morals, was worth a thousand
of such gay flutterers. Her Sister Clary might
think it worth her while perhaps to try to engage
such a man: She had patience: She was mistress
of persuasion; and indeed, to do the girl justice,
had something of a person: But as for her, she
would not have a man of whose heart she could not
be sure for one moment; no, not for the world: And
most sincerely glad was she that she had rejected
him.’ 

But when Mr. Lovelace returned into the country,
he thought fit to visit my Father and Mother; hopeing,
as he told them, that, however unhappy he had
been in the rejection of the wished-for alliance; he
might be allowed to keep up an acquaintance and
friendship with a family which he should always respect. 
And then, unhappily as I may say, was I at
home and present. 
It was immediately observed, that his attention was
fixed on me. My Sister, as soon as he was gone, in a
spirit of bravery, seemed desirous to promote his address,
should it be tendered. 
My Aunt Hervey was there; and was pleased to
say, We should make the finest couple in England— 
if my Sister had no objection. —No indeed! with a
haughty toss, was my Sister's reply—It would be
strange if she had, after the denial she had given him
upon full deliberation. 
My Mother declared, That her only dislike of his
alliance with either Daughter, was on account of his
reputed faulty morals. 
My Uncle Harlowe, That his Daughter Clary, as
he delighted to call me from childhood, would reform
him if any woman in the world could. 
My Uncle Antony gave his approbation in high
terms: But referred, as my Aunt had done, to my
Sister. 
She repeated her contempt of him; and declared,
that were there not another man in England, she
would not have him. She was ready, on the contrary,
she could assure them, to resign her pretensions
under hand and seal, if Miss Clary were taken with
his tinsel; and if every one else approved of his address
to the girl. 
My Father indeed, after a long silence, being urged
by my Uncle Antony to speak his mind, said, That he
had a Letter from his Son, on his hearing of Mr.
Lovelace's visits to his Daughter Arabella; which he 

had not shewn to any-body but my Mother; that
treaty being at an end when he received it: That in
this Letter he expressed great dislike to an alliance
with Mr. Lovelace on the score of his Immoralities: 
That he knew indeed, there was an old grudge between
them; but that, being desirous to prevent all
occasions of disunion and animosity in his family, he
would suspend the declaration of his own mind till
his Son arrived, and till he had heard his further objections: 
That he was the more inclined to make his
Son this compliment, as Mr. Lovelace's general character
gave but too much ground for his Son's dislike
of him; adding, That he had heard (So, he supposed,
had every one) that he was a very extravagant man; 
that he had contracted debts in his travels: And indeed,
he was pleased to say, he had the air of a spend-thrift. 
These particulars I had partly from my Aunt Hervey,
and partly from my Sister; for I was called out
as soon as the subject was entered upon. When I
returned, my Uncle Antony asked me, How I should
like Mr. Lovelace? Every-body saw, he was pleased
to say, that I had made a conquest. 
I immediately answered, That I did not like him at
all: He seemed to have too good an opinion both of
his person and parts, to have any great regard to his
Wife, let him marry whom he would. 
My Sister particularly was pleased with this answer,
and confirmed it to be just; with a compliment to
my judgment—For it was hers. 
But the very next day Lord M. came to Harlowe-Place
[I was then absent]; and in his Nephew's name
made a proposal in form; declaring, That it was the
ambition of all his family to be related to ours: And
he hoped his Kinsman would not have such an answer
on the part of the younger Sister, as he had had on
that of the elder. 
In short, Mr. Lovelace's visits were admitted as 

those of a man who had not deserved disrespect from
our Family; but as to his address to me, with a reservation,
as above, on my Father's part, that he would
determine nothing without his Son. My discretion as
to the rest was confided in: For still I had the same
objections as to the man: Nor would I when we were
better acquainted hear any thing but general talk
from him; giving him no opportunity of conversing
with me in private. 
He bore this with a resignation little expected from
his natural temper, which is generally reported to be
quick and hasty; unused it seems from childhood to
check or controul. A case too common in considerable
families where there is an only Son: And his
Mother never had any other child. But, as I have heretofore
told you, I could perceive notwithstanding this
resignation, that he had so good an opinion of himself,
as not to doubt, that his person and accomplishments
would insensibly engage me: And could That
be once done, he told my Aunt Hervey, he should
hope, from so steady a temper, that his hold in my
affections would be durable: While my Sister accounted
for his patience in another manner, which
would perhaps have had more force if it had come
from a person less prejudiced: ‘That the man was
not fond of marrying at all: That he might perhaps
have half-a-score mistresses; and that delay
might be as convenient for his roving, as for my
well-acted indifference.’ —That was her kind expression. 
Whatever was his motive for a patience so generally
believed to be out of his usual character, and
where the object of his address was supposed to be of
fortune considerable enough to engage his warmest
attention, he certainly escaped many mortifications by
it: For while my Father suspended his approbation till
my Brother's arrival, Mr. Lovelace received from
every one those civilities which were due to his birth: 

And altho' we heard from time to time reports to his
disadvantage with regard to morals; yet could we
not question him upon them without giving him
greater advantages in his own opinion than the situation
he was in with us would justify to prudence; 
since it was much more likely that his address would
not be allowed of, than that it would. 
And thus was he admitted to converse with our
family almost upon his own terms; for while my
friends saw nothing in his behaviour but what was
extremely respectful, and observed in him no violent
importunity, they seemed to have taken a great liking
to his conversation: While I considered him only as
a common guest when he came; and thought myself
no more concerned in his visits, nor at his entrance or
departure, than any other of the family. 
But this indifference on my side was the means of
procuring him one very great advantage; since upon
it was grounded that correspondence by Letters which
succeeded;—and which, had it been to be begun when
the family animosity broke out, would never have
been entered into on my part. The occasion was this: 
My Uncle Hervey has a young gentleman entrusted
to his care, whom he has thoughts of sending abroad a
year or two hence, to make the Grand Tour, as it is
called; and finding Mr. Lovelace could give a good
account of every-thing necessary for a young traveller
to observe upon such an occasion, he desired him to
write down a description of the Courts and Countries
he had visited, and what was most worthy of curiosity
in them. 
He consented, on condition that I would direct his
subjects, as he called it: And as every one had heard
his manner of writing commended; and thought his
narratives might be agreeable amusements in winter
evenings; and that he could have no opportunity particularly
to address me in them, since they were to be
read in full assembly before they were given to 

the young gentleman, I made the less scruple to write,
and to make observations, and put questions for our
further information—Still the less perhaps as I love
writing; and those who do, are fond, you know, of
occasions to use the pen: And then, having every
one's consent, and my Uncle Hervey's desire that I
would write, I thought that if I had been the only
scrupulous person, it would have shewn a particularity
that a vain man might construe to his advantage; and
which my Sister would not fail to animadvert upon. 
You have seen some of these Letters; and have
been pleased with his account of persons, places, and
things; and we have both agreed, that he was no
common observer upon what he had seen. 
My Sister herself allowed that the man had a tolerable
knack of writing and describing: And my Father,
who had been abroad in his youth, said, That his remarks
were curious, and shewed him to be a person
of reading, judgment, and taste. 
Thus was a kind of correspondence begun between
him and me, with general approbation; while every
one wondered at, and was pleased with, his patient veneration
of me; for so they called it. However, it was
not doubted but he would soon be more importunate,
since his visits were more frequent, and he acknowleged
to my Aunt Hervey a passion for me, accompanied
with an awe that he had never known before: to
which he attributed what he called his but seeming acquiescence
with my Father's pleasure, and the distance
I kept him at. And yet, my dear, this may be his
usual manner of behaviour to our Sex; for had not
my Sister at first all his reverence? 
Mean time, my Father, expecting this importunity,
kept in readiness the reports he had heard in his disfavour,
to charge them upon him then, as so many
objections to his address. And it was highly agreeable
to me that he did so: It would have been strange if
it were not; since the person who could reject Mr. 

Wyerley's address for the sake of his free opinions,
must have been inexcusable, had she not rejected another's
for his freer practices. 
But I should own, that in the Letters he sent me
upon the general subject, he more than once inclosed
a particular one, declaring his passionate regards for
me, and complaining, with fervour enough, of my reserves: 
But of these I took not the least notice; for, as
I had not written to him at all, but upon a subject so
general, I thought it was but right to let what he
wrote upon one so particular pass off as if I had never
seen it; and the rather, as I was not then at liberty
(from the approbation his Letters met with) to break
off the correspondence, unless I had assigned the true
reason for doing so. Besides, with all his respectful
assiduities, it was easy to observe (if it had not been
his general character) that his temper is naturally
haughty and violent; and I had seen too much of that
untractable spirit in my Brother to like it in one who
hoped to be still more nearly related to me. 
I had a little specimen of this temper of his upon
the very occasion I have mentioned: For after he had
sent me a third particular Letter with the general one,
he asked me the next time he came to Harlowe-Place; 
If I had not received such a one from him? — 
I told him, I should never answer one so sent; and that
I had waited for such an occasion as he had now
given me, to tell him so: I desired him therefore not
to write again on the subject; assuring him, that if
he did, I would return both, and never write another
line to him. 
You can't imagine how saucily the man look'd; 
as if, in short, he was disappointed that he had not
made a more sensible impression upon me: Nor, when
he recollected himself (as he did immediately) what a
visible struggle it cost him to change his haughty airs
for more placid ones. But I took no notice of either; 
for I thought it best to convince him, by the coolness 

and indifference with which I repulsed his forward
hopes (at the same time intending to avoid the affectation
of pride or vanity) that he was not considerable
enough in my eyes to make me take over-ready
offence at what he said, or at his haughty looks: In
other words, that I had not value enough for him to
treat him with peculiarity either by smiles or frowns. 
Indeed he had cunning enough to give me, undesignedly,
a piece of instruction which taught me this caution; 
for he had said in conversation once, ‘That if
a man could not make a woman in courtship own
herself pleased with him, it was as much and oftentimes
more to his purpose to make her angry with
him.’ 
I must break off here. But will continue the subject
the very first opportunity. Mean time, I am 
Your most affectionate Friend and Servant,
Cl. Harlowe.
