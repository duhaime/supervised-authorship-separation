Mr. Lovelace, To John Belford, Esq;
[In Answer to his of Aug. 17. See Letter xliv. 

Sunday, Aug. 20. 
What an unmerciful fellow art thou! A man
has no need of a conscience, who has such an
impertinent monitor. But if Nic. Rowe wrote a
Play that answers not his title, am I to be reflected
upon for that? —I have sinned; I repent; I would
repair—She forgives my sin: She accepts my repentance: 
But she won't let me repair—What wouldst
have me do? 
But get thee gone to Belton, as soon as thou canst. 
Yet whether thou goest or not, up I must go, and see
what I can do with the sweet oddity myself. The
moment these prescribing varlets will let me, depend
upon it, I go. Nay, Lord M. thinks she ought to
permit me one interview. His opinion has great authority
with me—when it squares with my own: 
And I have assured him, and my two Cousins, that
I will behave with all the decency and respect that
man can behave with to the person whom he most respects. 
And so I will. Of this, if thou chusest not
to go to Belton mean time, thou shalt be witness. 
Colonel Morden, thou hast heard me say, is a
man of honour and bravery: —But Colonel Morden
has had his girls, as well as you and I. And indeed,
either openly or secretly, who has not? The devil 

always baits with a pretty wench, when he angles for
a man, be his age, rank, or degree, what it will. 
I have often heard my Beloved speak of the Colonel
with great distinction and esteem. I wish he
could make matters a little easier, for her mind's sake,
between the rest of the Implacables and herself. 
Methinks I am sorry for honest Belton. But a
man cannot be ill, or vapourish, but thou liftest up
thy shriek-owl note, and killest him immediately. 
None but a fellow, who is fit for a drummer in
death's forlorn hope, could take so much delight,
as thou dost, in beating a dead-march with thy goose-quills. 
&dotup;Whereas, didst thou but know thine own talents,
thou art formed to give mirth by thy very appearance; 
and wouldst make a better figure by half,
leading up thy brother-bears at Hockley in the Hole,
to the music of a Scots bagpipe. Methinks I see thy
clumsy sides shaking (and shaking the sides of all
beholders) in these attitudes; thy fat head archly
beating time on thy porterly shoulders, right and
left by turns, as I once beheld thee practising to
the hornpipe at Preston. Thou remembrest the
frolick, as I have done an hundred times; for I
never before saw thee appear so much in character. 
&dotup;But I know what I shall get by this—Only that
notable observation repeated, That thy outside is
the worst of thee, and mine the best of me. And
so let it be. Nothing thou writest of this sort can
I take amiss.&dotup; 
But I shall call thee seriously to account, when I
see thee, for the Extracts thou hast given the Lady
from my Letters, notwithstanding what I said in my
last; especially if she continue to refuse me. An
hundred times have I myself known a woman deny,
yet comply at last: But, by these Extracts, thou hast,
I doubt, made her bar up the door of her heart, as
she used to do her chamber-door, against me. —This 

therefore is a disloyalty that friendship cannot bear,
nor honour allow me to forgive.
