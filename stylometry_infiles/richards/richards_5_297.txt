Lady Clementina, To Sir Charles Grandison. 


Sat. morn. Febr. 17. 
I depend upon your honour, Sir, for the performance
of the prescribed conditions: Yet, on
meditating my appearance before you, I am more and
more ashamed to see you. It was a great disappointment
to me at my first arrival, that you were at your 

country-seat. At that time my heart was full. I had
much to say, and I could have seen you then with
more fortitude than now falls to my share. However,
I will see you. To-morrow, Sir, about five in the
evening, you will find at one of the doors on the
higher ground, on the left hand going up St. James's
street, from the Palace, as it is called, the expecting
Laura, who will conduct you to 
Clementina.
