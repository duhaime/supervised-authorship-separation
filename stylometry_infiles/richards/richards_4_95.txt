Nothing particular having passed at
Dinner or Supper, but the most condescending
Goodness, on my Lady's side, to me; 
and the highest Civilities from Mr. Peters's
Family, from Lady Jones, from Sir Simon's
Family, &c. and reciprocal good Wishes all
round; and a Promise obtain'd from my Benefactor,
that he would endeavour to pass a Fortnight
or Three Weeks in these Parts, before
the Winter set in; I shall conclude this Day,
with observing, that I disposed of the Money
my Master was so good to put into my Hands,
in the Method he was pleased to direct; and I
gave Mrs. Jewkes hers, in such a manner, as
highly pleas'd her; and she wish'd me, with
Tears, all kind of Happiness; and pray'd me
to forgive her all her past Wickedness to me, 

as she herself call'd it. I begg'd Leave of my
Master to present Mrs. Worden with Five Guineas
for a Pair of Gloves; which he said was
well thought of. 
I should have mention'd, that Miss Darnford
and I agreed upon a Correspondence, which
will be no small Pleasure to me; for she is an
admirable young Lady; whom I prefer to every
one I have seen; and I shall, I make no doubt,
improve by her Letters; for she is said to have a
happy Talent in writing, and is learned and
well-read, for so young a Lady.
