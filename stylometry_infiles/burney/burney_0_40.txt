Sir John Belmont to Lady Howard. 
Paris, May 11. 
Madam,
I Have this moment the honour of your
Ladyship's letter, and I will not wait
another, before I return an answer. 
It seldom happens that a man, though
extolled as a saint, is really without blemish; 
or that another, though reviled as
a devil, is really without humanity. Perhaps
the time is not very distant, when I
may have the honour to convince your Ladyship
of this truth, in regard to Mr. Villars
and myself. 
As to the young Lady, whom Mr. Villars
so obligingly proposes presenting to me, I
wish her all the happiness to which, by your 
Ladyship's account, she seems entitled; and,
if she has a third part of the merit of her
to whom you compare her, I doubt not
but Mr. Villars will be more successful in
every other application he may make for
her advantage, than he can ever be in any
with which he may be pleased to favour
me. 
I have the honour to be,
Madam,
your Ladyship's most humble
and most obedient servant
John Belmont.
