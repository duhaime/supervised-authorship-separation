Sir,
The following Book is sincerely
designed to promote the Cause
of Virtue, and to expose some
of the most glaring Evils, as well public
as private, which at present infest
this Country; tho' there is scarce, as I
remember, a single Stroke of Satire
aimed at any one Person throughout
the whole. 

The best Man is the properest Patron
of such an Attempt. This, I believe,
will be readily granted; nor will
the public Voice, I think, be more divided,
to whom they shall give that
Appellation. Should a Letter indeed
be thus inscribed, Detur Optimo,
there are few Persons who would
think it wanted any other Direction. 
I will not trouble you with a Preface
concerning the Work; nor endeavour
to obviate any Criticisms which
can be made on it. The good-natured
Reader, if his Heart should be here
affected, will be inclined to pardon
many Faults for the Pleasure he will
receive from a tender Sensation; and
for Readers of a different Stamp, the
more Faults they can discover, the 

more, I am convinced, they will be
pleased. 
Nor will I assume the fulsome Stile of
a common Dedicator. I have not their
usual Design in this Epistle; nor will I
borrow their Language. Long, very
long may it be before a most dreadful
Circumstance shall make it possible for
any Pen to draw a just and true Character
of yourself, without incurring a
Suspicion of Flattery in the Bosoms of
the Malignant. This Task, therefore,
I shall defer till that Day (if I should be
so unfortunate as ever to see it) when
every good Man shall pay a Tear for the
Satisfaction of his Curiosity; a Day
which at present, I believe, there is
but one good Man in the World who
can think of with Unconcern. 

Accept then, Sir, this small Token
of that Love, that Gratitude, and that
Respect, with which I shall always
esteem it my GREATEST Honour to
be, 
SIR,
Your most obliged,
And most obedient
Humble Servant,
Henry Fielding.
