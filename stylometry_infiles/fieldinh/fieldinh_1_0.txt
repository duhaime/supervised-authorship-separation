Shewing the wholesome Uses drawn
from recording the Atchievements of
those wonderful Productions of Nature
called Great Men. 
As it is necessary that all great and
surprizing Events, the Designs of
which are laid, conducted, and
brought to Perfection by the utmost Force
of human Invention and Art, should be 

managed by great and eminent Men, so
the Lives of such may be justly and properly
styled the Quintessence of History. 
In these, when delivered to us by sensible
Writers, we are not only most agreeably
entertained, but usefully instructed; for
besides the attaining hence a consummate
Knowledge of human Nature in general; 
its secret Springs, various Windings, and
perplexed Mazes; we have here before our
Eyes, lively Examples of whatever is amiable
or detestable, worthy of Admiration
or Abhorrence, and are consequently taught
in a Manner infinitely more effectual than
by Precept, what we are eagerly to imitate
or carefully to avoid. 
But besides the two obvious Advantages
of surveying as it were in a Picture, the
true Beauty of Virtue, and Deformity of
Vice, we may moreover learn from Plutarch,
Nepos, Suetonius, and other Biographers
this useful Lesson, not too hastily
nor in the Gross to bestow either our
Praise or Censure: Since we shall often
find such a Mixture of Good and Evil in
the same Character, that it may require a 

very accurate Judgment and elaborate Inquiry
to determine which Side the Ballance
turns: for tho' we sometimes meet with
an Aristides or a Brutus, a Lysander or a
Nero, yet far the greater Number are of
the mixt Kind; neither totally good nor
bad; their greatest Virtues being obscured
and allayed by their Vices, and those again
softened and coloured over by their
Virtues. 
Of this kind was the illustrious Person
whose History we here now undertake; 
who, as he was embellished with many of
the greatest and noblest Endowments, so
these could not well be said to be absolutely
pure and without Allay. If we view
one Side of his Character only, he must
be acknowledged equal, if not superior to
most of the Heroes of Antiquity: But if
we turn the Reverse, it must be confessed
our Admiration will be a little abated,
and his Character will savour rather of
the Weakness of modern than the uniform
Greatness of ancient Heroes. 

We would not therefore be understood
to affect giving the Reader a perfect or consummate
Pattern of human Virtue; but rather
by faithfully recording the little Imperfections
which somewhat darkened the
Lustre of his great Qualities, to teach the
Lesson we have above mentioned, and induce
our Reader with us to lament the
Frailty of human Nature, and to convince
him that no Mortal, after a thorough
Scrutiny, can be a proper Object of our
Adoration. 
But before we enter on this great Work,
we must endeavour to remove some Errors
of Opinion which Mankind have by the
Disingenuity of Writers contracted: For
those from their Fear of attacking or contradicting
the obsolete Doctrines of a Set
of simple Fellows called, in Derision, Sages
or Philosophers, have endeavoured as much
as possible, to confound the Ideas of Greatness
and Goodness, whereas no two Things
can possibly be more distinct from each
other. For Greatness consists in bringing
all Manner of Mischief on Mankind, and 

Goodness in removing it from them. Now,
tho' the Writer, if he will confine himself
to Truth, is obliged to draw a perfect Picture
of the former in all the Actions
which he records of his Hero, yet to reconcile
his Work with those absurd Doctrines
abovementioned, he is ever guilty
of interspersing Reflections in Reality to
the Disadvantage of that great Perfection,
Uniformity of Character; for Instance, in
the Histories of Alexander and Cæsar, we
are frequently reminded of their Benevolence
and Generosity. When the former
had with Fire and Sword overrun a whole
Empire, and destroyed the Lives of Millions
of innocent People, we are told as an Example
of his Benevolence, that he did not cut
the Throat of an old Woman, and ravish
her Daughters whom he had before undone: 
And when the mighty Cæsar had
with wonderful Greatness of Mind destroyed
the Liberties of his Country, and
gotten all the Power into his own Hands,
we receive, as an Evidence of his Generosity,
his Largesses to his Followers and
Tools, by whose Means he had accomplished 

his Purpose, and by whose Assistance
he was to establish it. 
Now who doth not see that such sneaking
Qualities as these are rather to be bewailed
as Imperfections than admired as
Ornaments in those Great Men, rather obscuring
their Glory and holding them back
in their Race to Greatness, and unworthy
the End for which they seem to have come
into the World, viz. of perpetrating vast
and mighty Mischief? 
We hope our Reader will have Reason
justly to acquit us of any such confounding
Ideas in the following Pages, in which, as
we are to record the Actions of a Great
Man, so we have no where mentioned any
spark of Goodness which hath discovered
itself either faintly in him, or more glaringly
in any other Person, but as a Meanness
and Imperfection, disqualifying them for
Undertakings which lead to Honour and
Esteem among Men. 
As our Hero had as little as perhaps is
to be found of that Meanness, indeed only 

enough to make him Partaker of the Imperfection
of Humanity, and not the Perfection
of Dæmonism, we have ventured to
call him the Great; nor do we doubt
but our Reader will, when he hath perused
his Story, concur with us in allowing
him that Title.
