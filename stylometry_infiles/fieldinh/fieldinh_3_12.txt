Julian passes into a Fop. 
‘My next Scene of Action was Rome. 
I was born into a noble Family, and
Heir to a considerable Fortune. On which
my Parents, thinking I should not want any
Talents, resolved very kindly and wisely to
throw none away upon me. The only Instructors
of my Youth were therefore one
Saltator, who taught me several Motions
for my Legs; and one Ficus, whose Business 

was to shew me the cleanest way (as
he called it) of cutting off a Man's Head. 
When I was well accomplished in these
Sciences, I thought nothing more wanting,
but what was to be furnished by the several
Mechanics in Rome, who dealt in dressing
and adorning the Pope. Being therefore
well equipped with all which their Art could
produce, I became at the Age of Twenty,
a complete finished Beau. And now during
45 Years I drest, I sang and danced, and
danced and sang, I bowed and ogled, and
ogled and bowed, 'till in the 66th Year of
my Age, I got cold by over-heating myself
with dancing, and died. 
‘Minos told me as I was unworthy of
Elysium, so I was too insignificant to be
damned, and therefore bad me walk back
again.’
